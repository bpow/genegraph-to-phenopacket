# Work-in-progress proof-of-concept for transforming data from ClinGen's GaneGraph into phenopackets

Everything for now is in the `genegraph-validity-pyld.ipynb` notebook. If you have [pixi](https://pixi.sh/latest/)
installed then you should be able to call `pixi run start` to get a jupyter notebook session running with
the relevant dependencies installed.
