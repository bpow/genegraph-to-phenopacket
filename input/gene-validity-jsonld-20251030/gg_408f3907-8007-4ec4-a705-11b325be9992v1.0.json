At least 10 unique variants (e.g. missense, in-frame indel, frameshift, large deletion, etc) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data.\nVariants in this gene have been reported in at least twelve probands in eight publications (PMIDs: 15731758, 18394888, 28971531, 19502294, 17636067, 18560793, 22091729, 25259927). Variants in this gene also segregated with disease in 55 additional family members, totaling a LOD score of 18.29 and the maximum segregation evidence. The mechanism for disease is currently under investigation, however deleterious impact on clathrin-mediated endocytosis is likely involved for at least many of the known CMT variants. Of note, this gene has also been implicated in both a lethal autosomal recessive disorder and a dominant centronuclear myopathy. The latter has been assessed separately by the Congenital Myopathy GCEP. \nThis gene-disease association is supported by expression studies identifying all four isoforms of human DNM2 in the skeletal muscle and schwann cells of all ages and several functional assays demonstrating functional alteration to specifically clathrin-mediated endocytosis as well as myelination and cell survival when mutants are expressed. There are also several models that express DNM2 mutants in mice, however given the physiological differences it is difficult to fully model the heterozygous disorder as the mice seem to require a greater proportion of mutant protein to recapitulate the observed phenotypes.\nIn summary, DNM2 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/408f3907-8007-4ec4-a705-11b325be9992","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7bc54e5d-eed5-4d40-9e0d-143bfeb88cac","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7bc54e5d-eed5-4d40-9e0d-143bfeb88cac_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10063","date":"2020-10-27T13:18:27.010Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7bc54e5d-eed5-4d40-9e0d-143bfeb88cac_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10063","date":"2020-10-27T13:18:50.114Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7bc54e5d-eed5-4d40-9e0d-143bfeb88cac_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7bc54e5d-eed5-4d40-9e0d-143bfeb88cac_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6e56afae-174b-4cc8-b4b8-003de1c8134f","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"This knock-in model of a well-characterized CMT variant in humans, K562E, is unusual in that the heterozygous model itself does not recapitulate the primary phenotypes of a neuropathy, instead showing signs of a mild myopathy.

Hot plate, rotarod and forepaw grip strength tests revealed no significantly impaired performance of DNM2 wt/K562E mutants compared to controls in 2-month-old and 1-year-old mice. Minor gait abnormalities and less movement than controls show that the K562E mutation mildly affects locomotion in the mice. However, when performing electrophysiology measurements, there were no differences in the csNCV or mNCV. There was a decrease in the CMAP amplitude which was confirmed via repetitive stimulation analyses. Therefore there is no major damage to the neural component of these mice, however there are defecits in the muecular systems. Histological analysis of peripheral nerves revealed only minor morphological abnormalities in the myelin of DNM2 wt/K562E mice with no major signs of demyelination or remyelination, indicating no typical features of a neuropathy even up to 1 year of age. No reduction in myelinated axons or reduction in axonal diameters were observed either. Given the import of DNM2 in axonal sorting and clathrin-mediated endocytosis, both were observed in P0Cre Dnm2 fl/K562E mice that contain the Dnm2 K562E allele but lack wild-type DNM2 in schwann cells. It appears that neither early PNS development nor CME is affected by the lack of WT DNM2 and can be carried out by the K562E mutant. However, when the nerves and axons were compared to the controls, a strong reduction of myelinated axons and demyelination signs were observed. Paired with this, there was drastically reduced mNCV together with decreased CMAP amplitude compared to controls. These together show multiple hallmarks of a severe demyelinating neuropathy. Further investigation into the wt/K562E heterozygous mice showed signs of a primary myopathy, including muscle fiber degeneration and reduced diameter. This extended from even beyond the soleus muscle and is likely not affected by primary denervation. Furthermore, the mice do not develop signs of neutropenia. WT/null mice were also generated and had no significant changes in muscle or nerve formation, indicating that haploinsufficency is not the underlying mechansim for the myopathic features.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32129442","rdfs:label":"Mouse K562E Knock-In Model","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ca7299b6-b70c-4996-9eb3-cbce73500d40","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"This model, although not perfectly matching the inheritance pattern or pathogenic mechanism for the human disorder, clearly demonstrates a role for DNM2 in the development and maintenance of myelin as well as schwann cells.

This evidence demonstrates that, in all stages of an organism's life, DNM2 expression is necessary for proper schwann cell function.

Evaluation of clarathin-mediated endocytosis also confirmed a markedly reduced transferrin uptake in the mutant schwann cells, showing the function was affected. Behavioral abnormalities were noted in the mutant mice, with tremor and limb clasping developing. Biopsy confirmed that signs of a neuropathy, including reduced numbers of myelinated axons and myelinated fibers, were present in the mutant mice. Investigation determined that DNM2 is necessary for correct radial sorting of axons and subsequent myelination. Conditonal knock-out mice, P0ERT2-DNM2_KO, were generated to determine what the impact on myelin maintenance is for DNM2. These mice demonstrated a progressive gait impairment and severely reduced mNCVs and CMAPs that then improved rapidly afterwards. This indicates that demyelination and subsequent remyelination is the cause of the observed phenotype. Therefore, DNM2 is essential for myelin maintenance as well as initial development and formation. Investigation into DNM2's role in schwann cells for survival demonstrated that both developing and adult SCs depend critically on DNM2 for their survival and that, upon DNM2 loss, cells other than SCs invade developing peripheral nerves. Mutant cells also showed a decrease in mitotic events, abnormal cell cycle progression, and imapired cytokinesis. Notably, DNM2 was not necessary for oligodendrocyte differentiation and CNS myelination, which are typically unaffected in human CNM probands.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30648534","rdfs:label":"DNM2-KO Mice Show Neuropathy Phenotypes","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7bc54e5d-eed5-4d40-9e0d-143bfeb88cac_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6edb5082-19f8-4600-803b-0ac5eb04fbfb","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9272f278-f24e-4958-be4a-95ef256c7f1a","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Both of the CMT-associated mutants did not have any significant impact on the localization of DNM2, as they formed a filamentous pattern and localized per normal to the mitochondria.

With schwann-cell specific expression in transgenic Cre DNM2 WT/flox mice ganglia, myelination was again impaired only by the CMT mutants rather than the WT or CNM mutants. Further investigation demonstrated impaired clathrin-mediated endocytosis and resulting transferrin uptake in each CMT mutant but not in the CNM line. Cell surface levels of receptors was unchanged in these lines. Various membrane receptor protein levels were also affected by the CMT variants in DNM2.
