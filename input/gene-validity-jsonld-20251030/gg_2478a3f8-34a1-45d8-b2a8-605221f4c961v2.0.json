A preproprotein is encoded that undergoes proteolytic processing generating alpha and beta subunits that heterodimerize to form the mature lysosomal enzyme, acid ceramidase, which catalyzes the degradation of ceramide into sphingosine and free fatty acid.\n\nOMIM disease entities: Farber lipogranulomatosis (MIM: 228000) and Spinal muscular atrophy with progressive myoclonic epilepsy (MIM: 159950). The term \"ASAH1-related sphingolipidosis\", also referred to as acid ceramidase deficiency in the literature, has been introduced to lump the two disease assertions related to ASAH1. Both Farber lipogranulomatosis and Spinal muscular atrophy form a continuum (PMID: 32449975, 30029679), with progressive myoclonic epilepsy have moderate phenotypic overlap, including a patient with features of both diseases (PMID: 27650050), are inherited in the autosomal recessive manner, and result from biallelic variants in ASAH1 that result in loss of function.\n\n*ASAH1* was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive ASAH1-related sphingolipidosis in 1996 (Koch et al, PMID: 8955159). At least 100 missense variants have been reported in human patients. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data.\n\nSummary of Case Level Data (12 points):\n\nVariants in this gene have been reported in at least  11 probands in 6 publications (PMID: 22703880, 28251733, 8955159, 27650050, 24355074, 11241842) showing classic Farber lipogranulomatosis of varying severity, spinal muscular atrophy with progressive myoclonic epilepsy or a blended phenotype of both disorders. Much more evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence was reached.\n\nThe mechanism for disease is expected to be biallelic loss of function.\n\nSummary of experimental data (6 points):\n\nThis gene-disease relationship is supported by in vitro functional studies, model organisms and rescue evidence. Reduction in acid ceramidase activity leads to the accumulation of ceramides in the lysosomes (PMID: 27155573). Zebrafish and mouse models that partially recapitulate the human phenotype have been reported (PMID: 11829492, 23681708, 22703880). Rescue of phenotype by the wild-type gene product has been reported in a knock-in mouse model (PMID: 23681708). \n\nIn summary, *ASAH1* is definitively associated with autosomal recessive ASAH1-related sphingolipidosis. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the Lysosomal Diseases GCEP on October 4, 2023 (SOP v9).\n\nAdditional information on prenatal phenotype (added May 1, 2024):\nPrenatal phenotypes described in the literature in association with ASAH1 include non-immune hydrops fetalis, abnormal cardiac structure, arrhythmia, and  bradycardia.  Two cases are reported with bi-allelic splicing variants and an exonic deletion (PMID: 8650144, 9128814, 23707712, 37962265). Given the limited reports in the literature the association of ASAH1 with prenatal phenotypes is currently limited.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2478a3f8-34a1-45d8-b2a8-605221f4c961","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d7d25555-4d27-4fd4-8619-cdf78b50701a","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":[{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},{"id":"cg:sopChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d7d25555-4d27-4fd4-8619-cdf78b50701a_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10110","date":"2023-10-04T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d7d25555-4d27-4fd4-8619-cdf78b50701a_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10110","date":"2024-05-01T21:18:34.343Z","role":"Publisher"},{"agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10106","role":"SecondaryContributor"}],"curationReasons":["RecurationNewEvidence","NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d7d25555-4d27-4fd4-8619-cdf78b50701a_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d7d25555-4d27-4fd4-8619-cdf78b50701a_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/32a0746b-8b33-4500-a6cc-b5a2c3296064","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The function of acid ceramidase encoded by ASAH1 is well understood and patients with ASAH1 pathogenic variants show acid ceramidase deficiency and the resulting accumulation of ceramides, warranting maximum points for this evidence.","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7f5df21a-9550-4442-885f-95cfbef2d3e8","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Patients with ASAH1 variants present with Farber's lipogranulomatosis or spinal muscular atrophy and progressive myoclonic epilepsy or a combination of features of both disorders, with accumulation of ceramides due to the deficiency of the acid ceramidase enzyme.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27155573","rdfs:label":"Schuchman_ceramide metabolism","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d7d25555-4d27-4fd4-8619-cdf78b50701a_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ce84aad6-2bb3-40c0-bf09-6da483c9c0b1","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Score is reduced due to limited rescue of phenotypes associated with disease in the mouse model.
