The protein's basic structural unit is a heterotrimer of the alpha1(VI), alpha2(VI), and alpha3(VI) chains additionally encoded by the genes COL6A1 and COL6A3 to form the triple helical structural element common to collagens. Mutations in Collagen VI have historically been reported in relation to two different conditions. The first, Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy, was first described in a series of papers in the 1930s by Otto Ullrich and was notable due to occurrence of both weakness and joint hypermobility (Kongenitale atonisch-sklerotische Muskeldystrophie, 1930). The second, Bethlem myopathy, was reported by Bethlem and van Wijngaarden in 1976 as a dominant myopathy with development of joint contractures (PMID: 963533). Genetic analysis in patients with each of these disorders revealed both dominant and recessive defects in one of the COL6A1, COL6A2, or COL6A3 genes that affect the final Collagen VI protein. On the basis of clinical as well as genetic findings, Ullrich CMD and Bethlem myopathy can justifiably be regarded as being positioned at the flanking ends of a continuous spectrum of disease, which also includes limb-girdle and myosclerosis phenotypes, rather than as distinct clinical entities (PMID: 21496625). As such COL6A2 was curated in relation to a combined disease entity: Semidominant Collagen 6-Related Myopathy. More than 90 unique variants (e.g. missense, in-frame indel, nonsense, frameshift) have been reported in humans by ClinVar. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data. Variants included in this curation have been reported in at least nine probands in six publications (PMIDs: 8618682, 11381124, 15563506, 18852439, 19949035, 11865138). Many other cases are available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence has been reached. This gene-disease association is additionally supported by several pieces of experimental evidence, including its interaction with additional disease-causing genes COL6A1 and COL6A3 (PMID: 7768905), its function in the basement membrane surrounding muscle fibers (PMID: 9334230), which is disrupted in patient cells with altered expression in the extracellular matrix (PMID: 15563506), and models in both mice (PMID: 28650483) and zebrafish (PMID: 26362255). In summary, COL6A2 is definitively associated with semidominant collagen 6-related myopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/eb008805-263b-480d-aa27-0eb4bfecbbe7","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5fbb3f66-4f91-4c43-9900-6aba89420a7f","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5fbb3f66-4f91-4c43-9900-6aba89420a7f_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10031","date":"2021-02-24T19:58:10.461Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5fbb3f66-4f91-4c43-9900-6aba89420a7f_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10031","date":"2021-02-22T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5fbb3f66-4f91-4c43-9900-6aba89420a7f_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5fbb3f66-4f91-4c43-9900-6aba89420a7f_seg_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f00567b0-c3ae-41a9-b4cb-80d44b8a5aa8_proband_segregation","type":"FamilyCosegregation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11865138","rdfs:label":"Family 3","family":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f00567b0-c3ae-41a9-b4cb-80d44b8a5aa8","type":"Family","rdfs:label":"Family 3","member":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fa4f1730-ff8a-4d8c-b8a5-da3befb4b804","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11865138","rdfs:label":"Proband","detectionMethod":"Primers flanking all exons of the COL6A1 and COL6A2 genes were designed to PCR amplify genomic DNA.
