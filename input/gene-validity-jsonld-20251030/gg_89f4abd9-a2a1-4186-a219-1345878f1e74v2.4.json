In the absence of Cre, Shank3 KO mice exhibit deficits in exploratory behavior, anxiety, motor deficits, repetitive grooming behavior, and impaired neurotransmission in the dorsal striatum. Re-expressing Shank3 in adult mice improved synaptic protein composition, spine density, and neural function in the striatum. Additionally, certain behavioral abnormalities, including deficits in social interaction and repetitive grooming, could be rescued, while anxiety and motor coordination deficits could not.\nA subsequent study used a different Shank3 knock-in mouse model with a frameshift variant that was crossed with the same CreTam mouse line (PMID: 32152009). Although tamoxifen treatment in adult mice seemed to improve synaptic transmission and certain behaviors, subsequent comparisons revealed that the CreTam transgene had clear effects on baseline synaptic transmission and certain behaviors. This made the apparent positive genetic reversal effects difficult to interpret.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26886798","rdfs:label":"Adult restoration of Shank3 expression","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:PhenotypeRescue"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanRescueCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ab2addd5-d615-4e71-b6d3-2d55082f49d8","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5ca56a4d-6b54-417c-a573-d2a774f92474","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Complete knockout mouse model with a deletion of exons 4-22 (Δ4-22) of Shank3, leading to disruption of all Shank3 isoforms.
