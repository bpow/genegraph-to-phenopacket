One variant (frameshift) that has been reported in three affected probands from one family in one publication (PMIDs: 29326753) is included in this curation. This variant was not scored due to assertion for digenic inheritance with *TRPS1*. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss-of-function. This gene-disease relationship is supported by experimental evidence (expression-level evidence; Descartes fetal expression data, PMID: 17592114). Expression-level evidence in zebrafish with knockdown of CSRP1 is indicative of cardiac bifida. In summary, the evidence supporting the relationship between *CSRP1 *and autosomal dominant Congenital Heart Disease has been disputed and no valid evidence remains to support the claim. More evidence is needed to either support or entirely refute the role CSRP1 plays in this disease. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Congenital Heart Disease GCEP on the meeting date July 2nd 2024 (SOP Version 10).
