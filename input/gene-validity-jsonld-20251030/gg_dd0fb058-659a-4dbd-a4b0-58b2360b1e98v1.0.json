Cases of *TPM3*-related myopathy have historically been categorized by histological features in muscle biopsy and include nemaline myopathy, cap myopathy, and myopathy with fiber-type disproportion on a spectrum of severity. In support of the autosomal dominant form of *TPM3*-related myopathy, case-level genetic evidence includes at least sixteen probands with unique missense variants in *TPM3*, including eleven de novo cases (PMIDs: 7704029, 18300303, 20554445, 24692096, 26418456, 33768912, 38219297). These probands display various phenotypes, with the majority showing hypotonia, delayed motor milestones, muscle weakness, fiber atrophy, ptosis, contractures, and Type 1 muscle fiber hypotrophy and predominance. Variants in this gene segregated with disease in three families (1.5 points, PMIDs: 7704029, 18300303). Majority of the missense variants cause a dominant negative effect where the inclusion of mutant TPM3 leads to reduced calcium sensitivity with subsequent reduction in contractile ability, resulting in muscular hypotonia and weakness. Some variants, however, lead to increased calcium sensitivity with subsequent increase in contractile ability, resulting in muscle stiffness. (Marttila et al 2014, PMID: 24692096). This gene-disease association is additionally supported by TPM3's biochemical function, unique expression in the skeletal muscle tissue, physical protein interaction with ACTA1 (PMID: 22749829) and altered function of TPM3 mutant proteins dramatically changing myofilament function (PMID: 21357678). Additionally, a study involving a knock-in mouse model of the well-characterized *TPM3* variant Met9Arg recapitulates phenotypes of nemaline and other myopathies similar to those of the human disorder (PMID:11157795). Experimental-level genetic evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship scored 6 points. In summary, there is definitive evidence (13.5 points) to support the relationship between *TPM3* and autosomal dominant *TPM3*-related myopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Congenital Myopathies Gene Curation Expert Panel on the meeting date April 8, 2024 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/dd0fb058-659a-4dbd-a4b0-58b2360b1e98","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0c190069-e5ad-4562-b69a-66acde0a2179","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0c190069-e5ad-4562-b69a-66acde0a2179_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10031","date":"2024-06-24T19:28:55.112Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0c190069-e5ad-4562-b69a-66acde0a2179_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10031","date":"2024-04-08T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0c190069-e5ad-4562-b69a-66acde0a2179_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0c190069-e5ad-4562-b69a-66acde0a2179_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a6af35c6-55fe-4ff9-9fd4-ff0df9661ad3","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The Met9Arg mouse models, both the slow fiber-specific expression and the fiber-universal expression, recapitulate many of the phenotypes observed in humans.

They also displayed progressive muscle weakness starting around 5-6 months of age, a phenotype that matches the childhood-onset muscle weakness and other progressive symptoms common in TPM3-related congenital myopathy patients. Another classic phenotype, atrophy of Type I muscle fibers with a corresponding hypotrophy of Type II fibers was also present in the mice. This may be related to the increased number of slow/fast oxidative fibers in the mutant mice leading to the disruption of normal muscle fiber maturation. The mice also displayed some cytoplasmic bodies and tubular aggregates; these have been observed in varying functional studies and similar features have also been observed in humans.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11157795","rdfs:label":"Met9Arg Mouse Model","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":3}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":3},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0c190069-e5ad-4562-b69a-66acde0a2179_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/baaabd7d-de62-4d22-891e-33acd823df76","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f6a8b3ed-7016-4f0c-8efa-3272db69c660","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Dramatic changes in myofilament function","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21357678","rdfs:label":"Ottenheijm muscle fiber mechanics"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/991e1a96-2d86-437b-8aa0-7dac46131d17","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Many different assays in E. coli and expressed variants support the pathogenicity of TPM3, specifically the reduced actin binding affinity, the calcium sensitivity increase/decrease depending on the specific mutation, and the reduced filament gliding velocity when appraising the mutant vs WT filaments.

Depending on the mutation, calcium sensitivity either significantly increases or decreases compared to the wild-type yielding a hypercontractile or hypocontractile phenotype. Finally, the mutant actin filament gliding on thin filaments reduced the filament gliding velocity compared to wildtype to varying degrees depending on mutation and predicted severity.
