(25816005). At least 1 missense variant and 1 frameshift variant have been reported in humans (25816005, 30047143). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 17 additional family members. Evidence supporting this gene-disease association includes case-level, segregation and experimental evidence. In summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease association. While more evidence is needed to establish this association definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hearing Loss Working Group on 8/31/2020.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/47cec004-d3c0-4306-a0f6-954fc911085d","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9158c2a6-f11b-47b4-ac7d-45471f7255a1","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","changes":[{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},{"id":"cg:sopChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9158c2a6-f11b-47b4-ac7d-45471f7255a1_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2020-08-31T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9158c2a6-f11b-47b4-ac7d-45471f7255a1_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2020-09-16T19:23:38.512Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9158c2a6-f11b-47b4-ac7d-45471f7255a1_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9158c2a6-f11b-47b4-ac7d-45471f7255a1_seg_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/74496ea8-e876-4fe9-bee1-bde1392030f4_proband_segregation","type":"FamilyCosegregation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25816005","rdfs:label":"Azaiez Family","family":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/74496ea8-e876-4fe9-bee1-bde1392030f4","type":"Family","rdfs:label":"Azaiez Family","ethnicity":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/"},"member":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3b4997e7-b41b-4ca1-9a2d-b8e0bdcaf88e","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25816005","rdfs:label":"Azaiez Family Proband","ageType":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/","ageUnit":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/","detectionMethod":"whole exome sequencing performed for 3 affected individuals, additional affected is negative for OtoSCOPE panel","firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0008596","obo:HP_0000408"],"previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6faa5109-e2f1-4f35-8245-cd474970d6c8_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25816005","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/187d4197-bcf7-4908-9274-0a129e240852","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_199330.2(HOMER2):c.587G>C (p.Arg196Pro)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/218351"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"}}}},"meetsInclusionCriteria":true,"phenotypeFreeText":"","phenotypePositiveAllelePositive":10,"phenotypes":["obo:HP_0008596","obo:HP_0000408"],"proband":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3b4997e7-b41b-4ca1-9a2d-b8e0bdcaf88e"},"publishedLodScore":3,"sequencingMethod":{"id":"cg:AllGenesSequencing"}},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6409ea73-290c-472a-acb1-0fe19e1e22fb_proband_segregation","type":"FamilyCosegregation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30047143","rdfs:label":"Family-202","estimatedLodScore":2.11,"family":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6409ea73-290c-472a-acb1-0fe19e1e22fb","type":"Family","rdfs:label":"Family-202","ethnicity":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/"},"member":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b700f566-797e-4ed8-a1ef-80629e27b2c4","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30047143","rdfs:label":"Family-202 Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":7,"detectionMethod":"targeted genomic sequencing of 143 nuclear genes, 3 miRNA and 3 mitochondrial genes;
