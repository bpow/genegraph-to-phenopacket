Since that time, numerous variants have been reported in this gene in individuals with seemingly disparate phenotypes, inherited from reportedly unaffected parents, or observed in control populations. Further, population data from gnomAD (v2.1.1) indicates that *DPP6* is not highly constrained for either protein truncating variants (pLI = 0.34) or missense variation (Z score = 2.24), calling into question the relevance of previously reported variants in affected individuals. A detailed summary of available evidence and rationale for disputing this gene-disease relationship is provided below.\n\nIn the initial report by Liao et al. (PMID: 23832105) copy number variation (CNV) analysis of 22 patients with microcephaly and variable intellectual disability (ID) identified two *de novo* deletions in *DPP6*, both overlapping exon 1 (NM_130797). The same study sequenced *DPP6* in 50 additional patients with microcephaly and detected a missense variant in a three-generation pedigree with four affected individuals with microcephaly and ID. Functional studies of this missense variant and additional testing to rule out other possible genetic causes were not performed. Given the lack of evidence supporting their role in disease and the fact that no other *DPP6* variants have been reported in association with microcephaly and ID, these variants were not scored.\n\nRare deletions in *DPP6* have been reported in individuals with other neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric phenotypes, but their pathogenicity is also unclear. Three deletions were detected in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (one *de novo*, two inherited; PMIDs: 18252227, 20531469, 26402605). Of note, the patient with the *de novo* deletion did not have microcephaly (PMID: 20531469). Note that due to limitations of the ClinGen Gene Curation Interface, large deletions are unable to be scored at this time. Deletions were also identified in a family with Tourette syndrome (PMID: 25129042), an individual with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (inherited; PMID: 19546859), and an individual with schizophrenia (inheritance unknown; PMID: 30208311). In addition, disruption of *DPP6* has been reported in association with other phenotypes, including a chromosomal inversion disrupting *DPP6* in a three-generation pedigree with autosomal dominant Alzheimer’s disease (PMID: 30874922), and a translocation disrupting *DPP6* in an otherwise healthy male with azoospermia and in his mother and sister with normal phenotype (PMID: 24937803).\n\nWith respect to sequence variants, five nonsense variants, including one *de novo* and four without inheritance information, were identified in exome studies of autism spectrum disorder (PMIDs: 31452935, 31981491). Protein truncating variants have also been reported in an individual with schizophrenia (PMID: 27694994), two individuals with frontotemporal dementia (PMID: 30874922), and two parents of patients with autism (PMID: 31981491), but also in 50 subjects in gnomAD. \n\nTaken together, the available genetic evidence fails to support a role for heterozygous disruption of *DPP6* in ID, autism or other neurodevelopmental disorders. *DPP6* encodes an auxiliary subunit of Kv4.2 potassium channels. *Dpp6* knockout mice exhibit impaired hippocampal synaptic development and function, learning and memory deficits, and reduced body and brain weight (PMIDs: 21943606, 23912628, 29651237). The effects of heterozygous loss of *Dpp6* were not examined in these studies. Due to the limited human genetic evidence for *DPP6*, the experimental evidence was not scored.\n\nIn summary, the evidence supporting the relationship between *DPP6* and autosomal dominant complex neurodevelopmental disorder has been disputed and no valid evidence remains to support the claim. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel on May 5, 2021 (SOP Version 8).","The relationship between variants in DPP6 and autosomal dominant complex neurodevelopmental disorder was first reported in 2013.
