This association was made using case-level data. At least 7 variants (splice site, nonsense, frameshift) have been reported in humans. MARVELD2 was first associated with this disease in humans as early as 2006 (Riazuddin et al.​). Association is seen in at least 7 probands in 4 publications (17186462, 18084694, 22903915, 27344577). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in at least 38 additional family members. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. Many variants were shown to evade nonsense mediated decay and produce viable mRNA transcripts. Mice with the p.R500X variant seen in humans had hearing loss and while the mRNA did not undergo NMD, no protein product was detected in the inner ear tricellular tight junctions, where the WT protein localizes. This gene-disease association is also supported by a knock-out mouse model and relevant expression and protein interaction studies. In summary, MARVELD2 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hearing Loss Working Group on 1/5/18.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e038a939-5034-4260-b6d4-45e03d2db78a","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ba6df3f7-a000-401c-94d9-0dc5cb901f32","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ba6df3f7-a000-401c-94d9-0dc5cb901f32_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ba6df3f7-a000-401c-94d9-0dc5cb901f32_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2018-01-05T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ba6df3f7-a000-401c-94d9-0dc5cb901f32_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ba6df3f7-a000-401c-94d9-0dc5cb901f32_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e3d787f5-f69a-4c73-bb3c-4ddb74f82747","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c8d3223d-a772-4343-bc2f-bec53b812cc9","type":"Finding","dc:description":"knockout mouse generated.
