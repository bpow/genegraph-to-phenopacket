Variants in DBT were first reported in humans with the disease as early as 1991 (Herring et al., PMID: 1990841). At least 11 variants (missense, nonsense, frameshift, deletions) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. About 20% of MSUD cases are attributed to variants in this gene (Strauss et al., 2013; PMID: 20301495). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence and experimental evidence (18 pts.) has been reached. In summary, DBT is definitively associated with autosomal recessive maple syrup urine disease. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic\nsettings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Aminoaciopathy Gene Curation Expert Panel on 10/30/18 (SOP Version 5).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6996804b-6864-40e6-a88d-8a5800e91881","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cfd1ebde-e447-4877-977e-f5b9fe434adc","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cfd1ebde-e447-4877-977e-f5b9fe434adc_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10011","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cfd1ebde-e447-4877-977e-f5b9fe434adc_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10011","date":"2018-10-30T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cfd1ebde-e447-4877-977e-f5b9fe434adc_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/37a63a97-3621-491a-8143-acc4cb23afaa_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The deletion includes the 3' half of intron 10, the entire coding region of the terminal exon 11, and the 5' part of the 3' UTR of DBT.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f66c6201-a3ab-4736-ae26-519a49e32503","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24486081","rdfs:label":"Hou 2016 Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Days","ageValue":7,"detectionMethod":"Direct sequencing and duplex PCR of DBT.","phenotypeFreeText":"Recurrent skin lesions, Zinc deficiency, Acrodermatitis enteropathica-like skin lesions, Bulging fontanelle, Twitching of limbs, Elevated α-hydroxyisovalerat, Elevated 2-hydroxyisovaleric, Elevated 3-hydroxyisovaleric, Elevated 2-hydroxy-3-methylvaterate, Abnormal faint bilateral hemisphere echogenicity, Progressive scaling over body, Topical corticosteroid resistant periorificial and acral dermatitis, Cortical dysfunction, Recurrent skin rash, Wedging deformity of T11 and T12 vertebrae, Retropulsion of posterior bony margins, Hyperintensity, Swelling, enlargement of left hemisphere, Asymmetry, Prominent cisterns, Sulci of bilateral hemispheres, Brain signal changes.","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001943","obo:HP_0002014","obo:HP_0004396","obo:HP_0011343","obo:HP_0040187","obo:HP_0010913","obo:HP_0000010","obo:HP_0002650","obo:HP_0001276","obo:HP_0001894","obo:HP_0002151","obo:HP_0500001","obo:HP_0000938","obo:HP_0002196","obo:HP_0012402","obo:HP_0030842","obo:HP_0002205","obo:HP_0002751","obo:HP_0010911","obo:HP_0005897","obo:HP_0001270","obo:HP_0001903","obo:HP_0002045","obo:HP_0040181","obo:HP_0002910","obo:HP_0008277","obo:HP_0011185","obo:HP_0005619","obo:HP_0010910","obo:HP_0002176","obo:HP_0002019","obo:HP_0003542"],"previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"Hemoglobin 1.36 mM (normal 1.4-2.17 mM); 613x10^9 platelets/L (normal 150-400x10^9); glucose 2.16 mM (normal 3.3-5.5 mM).
