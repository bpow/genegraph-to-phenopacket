BBSOAS is characterized by visual impairment due to optic nerve abnormalities and/or cortical visual impairment, developmental delay, and intellectual disability. Additional findings may include hypotonia, seizures, autism spectrum disorder or autistic features, and hearing defects (PMIDs: 24462372, 26986877, 32275123). *NR2F1* variants, including missense, nonsense, frameshift and in-frame deletion variants, as well as large deletions, have been identified in over 50 individuals with BBSOAS (PMID: 32275123). Only 8 probands (PMIDs: 24462372, 26986877, 32275123) are included in this curation because the maximum score for genetic evidence has been reached. The disease mechanism is haploinsufficiency (PMIDs: 24462372, 26986877). However, a dominant-negative mechanism has been proposed for variants in the DNA binding domain (DBD) of the protein (PMIDs: 26986877, 32275123). Patients with variants in the DBD presented with more severe phenotypes, with increased prevalence of seizures and abnormal brain MRI findings compared to those with a deletion or coding variant outside of the DBD (PMIDs: 26986877, 32275123). This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence, including a mouse model and in vitro expression studies (PMIDs: 31600777, 26986877).\n\nIn summary, *NR2F1* is definitively associated with Bosch-Boonstra-Schaaf optic atrophy syndrome. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel on February 16, 2022 (SOP Version 8).\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/541befff-fe68-4930-876a-c4af12b38f29","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1aa4efce-b5b8-4cbd-b043-bb89c5283e3c","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1aa4efce-b5b8-4cbd-b043-bb89c5283e3c_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2022-08-31T15:59:53.217Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1aa4efce-b5b8-4cbd-b043-bb89c5283e3c_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2022-02-16T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1aa4efce-b5b8-4cbd-b043-bb89c5283e3c_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f4540d83-2079-4be4-9d1e-17e60e38f446","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"An additional 0.5pt was awarded because the phenotype of this patient is specific (visual impairment and dystrophic features), consistent with that observed in those with NR2F1 deletion.
