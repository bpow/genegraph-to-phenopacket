The phenotype associated with MTMR2 including vocal paresis, severe neuropathy at an early onset (adolescents), and pathologically with the presence of myelin outfolding (reviewed in Tazir et al., 2013; PMID: 23781959).  At least 25 unique variants, including missense, nonsense, frameshift, and indels have been reported in humans (reviewed in Pareyson et al., 2019, PMID: 31070812 and per the Inherited Neuropathy Variant Database). There are variant databases describing MTMR2 variants of interest in neuropathy, including (1) the Inherited Neuropathy Variant Database (URL: http://hihg.med.miami.edu/code/http/cmt/public_html/index.html#/) and (2) the MTMR2 LOVD database (https://databases.lovd.nl/shared/genes/MTMR2).  Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation and experimental data. This gene-disease relationship has been well studied and the case-level data does not reflect all published studies. This gene-disease relationship is supported by expression studies, protein interaction, animal models and rescue models. MTMR2 has 18 exons, and produces several transcripts due to two start sites (exon 1 and exon 3). Studies have indicated that nonsense mutations may not result in loss of protein expression, as the truncated proteins remain expressed in patient cells (Prevatali et al., 2003 PMID:1335693). The molecular mechanism is predicted to be loss of phosphatase activity (reviewed in Raghu et al., 2019; PMID: 31507376; Tazir et al., 2013; PMID: 23781959). In summary, MTMR2 is DEFINITIVELY associated with autosomal recessive demyelinating hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Charcot Marie Tooth Gene Curation Expert Panel on Feb 11, 2020.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a4b1beef-c172-45b4-a1aa-b32871967a58","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/44a837e2-ae06-4e4d-b7cf-ae2a3009b47d","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/44a837e2-ae06-4e4d-b7cf-ae2a3009b47d_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10063","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/44a837e2-ae06-4e4d-b7cf-ae2a3009b47d_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10063","date":"2020-02-11T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/44a837e2-ae06-4e4d-b7cf-ae2a3009b47d_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b1fce723-8b1f-4fc6-b53d-0aa60b89d306_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"This is a small deletion that is predicted to result in a frameshift and premature stop codon early in the MTMR2 transcript.

Flag-tagged MTMR2 was immunoprecipated and western blot expression of the pull down indicated that NFL was in the complex with MTMR2 (Fig. 4A). The reciprocal pull down with Myc-tagged NFL was able to immunoprecipitate flag-tagged MTMR2.

Fig 1 shows that Mtmr2 is expressed in both myelinating and nonmyelinating Schwann cells (glia). In teased nerve fiber preparations Mtmr2 is shown to localize to the paranodal/ nodal microvili region and within the Schmidt-Lantermann incisures (Figure 1N). Closer examination of nueronal staining revealed Mtmr2 expression in DRG sensory neruons in the ventral horn in both the cytoplasm and nucleau (Fig. 1O). Satellite cells were also noted to express Mtmr2 (fig. 1P). Furthermore, Northern blot analysis of Mtmr2 in from primary Schwann cell cultures indicates expression of Mtmr2.\n\nOf note, On NCBI Gene, RNA-seq analysis indicates ubiquitous expression of MTMR2: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/8898.
