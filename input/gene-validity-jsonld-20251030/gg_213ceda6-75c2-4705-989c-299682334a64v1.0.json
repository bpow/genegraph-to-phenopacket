At least 5 unique variants (e.g. missense, splicing, nonsense, and frameshift) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 6 probands in 3 publications (PMIDs: 27743390, 29898956, 31276734). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 7 additional family members. This gene-disease association is supported by its enhanced expression in lymphoid tissue (PMID: 17311996), its inhibitory biochemical function in platelet activation (PMID: 17311996), and mouse models (including knockout, knock-in, megakaryocyte specific conditional knockout, and humanized models) which recapitulate human disease (PMIDs: 23112346, 23509158, 29891536, 29898956). In summary, MPIG6B is definitively associated with autosomal recessive Thrombocytopenia, anemia, and myelofibrosis.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/213ceda6-75c2-4705-989c-299682334a64","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/03b93956-5abe-41f2-ba14-1e57952606b3","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/03b93956-5abe-41f2-ba14-1e57952606b3_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2020-10-29T12:04:39.847Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/03b93956-5abe-41f2-ba14-1e57952606b3_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2020-10-28T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/03b93956-5abe-41f2-ba14-1e57952606b3_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/03b93956-5abe-41f2-ba14-1e57952606b3_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2225c7df-34e0-4764-a754-5457132b6106","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"In a transgenic mouse model, expressing a mutant form of G6b-B in which tyrosine residues 212 and 238 within ITIM and ITSM were mutated to phenylalanine, mice homozygous for the mutation were macrothrombocytopenic, as a result of the reduction in platelet production, and had large clusters of megakaryocytes and myelofibrosis at sites of hematopoiesis, similar to those observed in G6b-deficient mice and patients.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/57325e71-478b-43e7-b418-f4bf6742c819","type":"Finding","dc:description":"In mice the platelet count was reduced by 76% and platelet volume was increased by 36% in G6b-B diY/F mice compared with WT mice.

Chemistry studies including liver function tests, electrolytes, and creatinine were normal. Her LDH was elevated at 446 with a negative direct Coombs test. Her immunology workup showed normal immunoglobulin levels (IgG, IgA, IgM) and a largely unremarkable lymphocyte subsets with a slight increase in CD19+ B-cells and mild decrease in CD3+ T-cells). Her molecular work up included sequencing analysis for JAK2, MPL, CALR and VPS45, all of which were negative.","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f2e20266-73ad-434f-af57-df536818e0a9_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29898956","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b8d9c85d-df1e-42db-9c12-2afe363449b6"}}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/df34875a-10cc-4142-a798-b03e55357a30_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The homozygous frameshift variant Pro134Leufs generates a premature stop codon in exon 3 of 6, which is predicted to result in NMD.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2c7ea39a-7a6a-4f3f-b46d-c590b864ba8e","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31276734","rdfs:label":"Chen Patient","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":10,"detectionMethod":"WES in the patient with confirmatory mutation screening in the parents.","firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"lower hemoglobin levels ranging from 70 to 90 g/L, platelets counts ranging between 4000 and 11,000/mm^3, mean platelet volume (MPV) was approximately 12.3 fL, white blood cell counts were moderately decreased about 3.56 * 109/L., and increased lymphocytes","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001876","obo:HP_0001903","obo:HP_0000967","obo:HP_0004823","obo:HP_0011974","obo:HP_0001744","obo:HP_0000980"],"previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/df34875a-10cc-4142-a798-b03e55357a30_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31276734","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3867f2af-4567-49d6-85d2-eae0bd2a9921","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"XM_017011333.1(C6orf25):c.444del (p.Pro150LeufsTer15)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA915940204"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"}}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e8d81d01-6120-4512-898a-0b4fb364db0b_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The homozygous nonsense variant Cys108Ter occurs in exon 2 of 6 and is predicted to result in NMD.
