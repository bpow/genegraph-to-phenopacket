The NDUFA10 gene encodes the NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) subunit A10, a non-catalytic complex I accessory protein required for complex I assembly and function within the mitochondria.  Defects of this protein lead to complex I deficiency.\n\nThe NDUFA10 gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Leigh syndrome spectrum in 2011 (PMID: 21150889). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data.\n\nThis curation included three unique variants identified in three cases from three publications (PMIDs: 22200994, 28247337, 21150889). No segregation data were available. Loss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease association is also supported by known protein interactions and functional alterations observed in patient cells and in non-patient cells (PMIDs: 21150889, 27626371, 27509854). \n\nIn summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on June 10, 2019 (SOP Version 6).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f2b7b842-3f27-4f47-8b8c-fe8f1090030a","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e40eec3c-0ce0-442e-9058-6bf4d90d6dc3","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e40eec3c-0ce0-442e-9058-6bf4d90d6dc3_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2019-11-25T16:20:49.949Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e40eec3c-0ce0-442e-9058-6bf4d90d6dc3_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e40eec3c-0ce0-442e-9058-6bf4d90d6dc3_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/52bfe818-2e5f-4852-b3c0-fb5bfcd962f7_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"No gene impact data although the variant was observed in a case reported by Haack et al.
