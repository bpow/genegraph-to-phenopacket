Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, there is insufficient evidence of a difference in molecular mechanisms or inheritance pattern despite genotype:phenotype correlations that may explain the wide phenotypic spectrum observed from *ADA2* (PMID: 30406060, 31945408, 35095905, 37256629). Therefore, these entities were curated together under the umbrella term “deficiency of adenosine deaminase 2.” DADA2 is a heterogenous disease with variable expressivity that has different clinical manifestations including vasculitis, immune system dysregulation, and hematopoietic system impairment. Clinical features range from livedo racemosa, early-onset stroke, peripheral neuropathy, systemic vasculitis, musculoskeletal issues, and immune features such as systemic inflammation, severe bone marrow failure (severe B cell deficiency and pure red cell aplasia are among the most notable features), and immunodeficiency (PMID: 30406060, 31945408, 35095905, 35898506, 37179309, 37256629). DADA2 displays inter- and intrafamilial variability and penetrance is incomplete as asymptomatic individuals with biallelic *ADA2* variants have been reported (PMID: 26867732, 27059682, 31945408). ADA2 activity is much lower in individuals with biallelic pathogenic *ADA2* variants than in carriers and healthy controls (PMID: 32001434, 32054602, 32650798, 37256629). Notably, carriers of *ADA2* disease-causing variants have decreased ADA2 expression compared to healthy controls and there have been rare reports of carriers presenting with clinical features of DADA2 (PMID: 24552284, 29681619). \n\nEleven variants (missense, in-frame indel, nonsense, frameshift, deletion) that have been reported in 8 probands in 5 publications (PMIDs: 24552284, 24737293, 28665179, 35774100, 35852217) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is known to be loss of function. This gene-disease association is also supported by experimental evidence, including an animal model, expression studies, and in vitro functional assays in both cell lines and patient-derived cells (PMIDs: 20453107, 24552284, 27663683, 32707604, 34004258, 35529868, 35663977). For example, ADA2 knockdown in a Zebrafish model resulted in increased bleeding and ischemia in the brain and neutropenia (PMID: 24552284). In an in vitro cell culture model, incubation of either a monocyte cell line lacking ADA2 expression or DADA2 patient-derived monocytes with an endothelial cell line resulted in damage to the endothelial cell layer (PMID: 24552284). DADA2 patient-derived B cells display decreased proliferation and immunoglobulin secretion following stimulation (PMID: 32707604). In a series of rescue experiments, transduction of DADA2 patient-derived hematopoietic stem cells or macrophages with a lentivirus carrying human ADA2 rescued features of disease, including decreased stem cell proliferation and stem cell and macrophage pro-inflammatory responses (PMID: 35529868). Hematopoietic cell transplantation has been demonstrated to rescue ADA2 activity and ameliorate hematological and immunological features with no new vascular events in DADA2 patients, particularly those presenting with bone marrow failure, immune cytopenia, malignancy, or immunodeficiency (PMID: 34324127, 35095905, 37256629).\n\nIn summary, *ADA2* is definitively associated with autosomal recessive deficiency of adenosine deaminase 2. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/91c8b2bc-9779-4a75-8596-3214a63550ee","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e05f1338-6a58-4991-af3b-6433bd165a9f","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e05f1338-6a58-4991-af3b-6433bd165a9f_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10080","date":"2023-07-09T22:50:19.058Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e05f1338-6a58-4991-af3b-6433bd165a9f_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10080","date":"2023-05-30T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e05f1338-6a58-4991-af3b-6433bd165a9f_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/463ece07-e7ef-43c9-b225-b7456c420e0e_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f9ce0078-f6eb-4e3b-bae2-a53d8aa1cbd3","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Variant is absent from gnomAD and patient displayed no plasma ADA2 activity.","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f9ce0078-f6eb-4e3b-bae2-a53d8aa1cbd3_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"No ADA2 enzyme activity was detected in the patient’s plasma, so the patient was diagnosed with ADA2 deficiency at the age of 6 months.
