This association was made using case-level data only. At least 9 variants (missense, in-frame indel, nonsense, frameshift) have been reported in humans. CIB2  was first associated with this disease in humans as early as 2012 (Riazuddin et al.). Association is seen in at least 9 probands in 6 publications (23023331, 26173970, 26473954, 27344577, 26226137, 26445815). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 4 additional family members. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence and experimental evidence have been reached. This gene-disease association is supported by two mouse models (Giese et al. 2017) and a zebrafish model (Riazuddin et al. 2012). In summary, CIB2 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hearing Loss Working Group on 2/20/2018.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e8576a75-eed0-4ee1-9b08-639010c7b932","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d4187cb6-182f-43fc-aeec-d27297c36bdb","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d4187cb6-182f-43fc-aeec-d27297c36bdb_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2018-02-20T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d4187cb6-182f-43fc-aeec-d27297c36bdb_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d4187cb6-182f-43fc-aeec-d27297c36bdb_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d4187cb6-182f-43fc-aeec-d27297c36bdb_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fd3454c2-423d-4b28-804a-8924e51cba4e","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Downgraded for animal model type.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/39bdc0ea-0735-4994-b2c0-bd258f00d89d","type":"Finding","dc:description":"MO-knockdown in zebrafish.
