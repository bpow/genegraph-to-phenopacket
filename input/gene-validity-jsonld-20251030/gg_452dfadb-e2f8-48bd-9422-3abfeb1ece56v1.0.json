The SQOR gene encodes sulfide quinone oxidoreductase, an enzyme that breaks down hydrogen sulfide which, when accumulated, inhibits complex IV. \n\nThe SQOR gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Leigh syndrome spectrum in 2020 (PMID: 32160317). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included two variants identified in two cases from one publication (PMID: 32160317). Of note, there was much debate among this Expert Panel if Subject II-3 from Family B should be scored as the variant was also found to be homozygous in two healthy siblings. However, after extensive discussion within the Expert Panel, it was decided to score this case but downgrade the score. No segregation data were available. Loss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease association is also supported by biochemical function and expression (PMIDs: 27977873, 22067608).\n\nIn summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on November 23, 2020 (SOP Version 7).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/452dfadb-e2f8-48bd-9422-3abfeb1ece56","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/09ea3b0c-cc3a-44d1-a702-9f1674c33040","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/09ea3b0c-cc3a-44d1-a702-9f1674c33040_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2021-01-21T00:51:24.845Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/09ea3b0c-cc3a-44d1-a702-9f1674c33040_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2021-01-21T00:51:35.026Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/09ea3b0c-cc3a-44d1-a702-9f1674c33040_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/afffa93d-6700-4b1f-9fd8-12bc922655a8_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Crystal structure of SQOR: The side chain of Glu213 is predicted to be involved in hydrogen bonding interactions with the side chains of these two arginine residues, positively charged lysine in the Glu213Lys mutant is predicted to disrupt these electrostatic interactions and destabilize the tertiary structure of the protein.\nMuscle and liver tissue showed reduced levels of SQOR protein\nSQOR activity assay: SQOR activity in subject A.II-3 liver was severely reduced to 6% of the average of control values.\nNote: Founder variant in the Lehrerleut Hutterite population with a carrier frequency estimated to be as high as 1 in 13 based on limited screening of samples from this population.","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/be33d7ef-e7eb-4fbb-99bf-21543c42356c","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32160317","rdfs:label":"Family A subject II-3","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":4,"ethnicity":{"id":"cg:NotHispanicOrLatino"},"phenotypeFreeText":"At onset of the illness, during the day she was more tired and vomited, and in the evening became rapidly encephalopathic with an episode of tonic seizures.\nAt presentation: comatose with seizure like movements, Kussmaul breathing due to lactic acidosis, she developed shock, acute respiratorory distress syndrome with and multi-organ failure including liver failure.\nIn subsequent weeks, she had generalized hypotonia, and episodes of neurostorming with tachycardia, hypertension, and potentially pain.
