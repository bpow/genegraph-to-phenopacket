Including the initial report, a total of four unique homozygous ST3GAL3 variants (three missense variants and one nonsense variant) in four families have been reported (PMID: 21907012, 23252400, 31584066). Clinical features observed in affected individuals include developmental delay, nonsyndromic intellectual disability, and epileptic encephalopathy (in two families). In one family, the ST3GAL3 variant segregated with disease in three additional family members (PMID: 23252400). ST3GAL3 encodes a sialyltransferase. Diminished enzyme activity and/or altered subcellular localization of the  mutant protein were demonstrated by functional studies, supporting a loss-of-function disease mechanism (PMID: 21907012, 23252400, 31584066). This gene-disease relationship is further supported by functional alteration in patient cells, mouse models, and expression studies (PMID: 8027041, 22735313, 25846372, 30089820).  In summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease association. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel on 6/3/2020.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e69c5474-c738-45b1-a715-1c3362008177","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e151129d-46fc-4f7e-a434-e423a3fb644b","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","changes":{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e151129d-46fc-4f7e-a434-e423a3fb644b_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2021-01-08T14:54:45.174Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e151129d-46fc-4f7e-a434-e423a3fb644b_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2020-06-03T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e151129d-46fc-4f7e-a434-e423a3fb644b_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e151129d-46fc-4f7e-a434-e423a3fb644b_seg_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a9d0f12b-27c1-4521-aae9-ba0b59b0355f_proband_segregation","type":"FamilyCosegregation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23252400","rdfs:label":"a consanguineous Palestinian family","estimatedLodScore":2.31,"family":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a9d0f12b-27c1-4521-aae9-ba0b59b0355f","type":"Family","rdfs:label":"a consanguineous Palestinian family","member":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9ca865b9-0cab-453a-b1d7-860102e0ce81","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23252400","rdfs:label":"4696","firstTestingMethod":"Homozygosity mapping","secondTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/64f65f14-a81d-4809-906e-a8c36c27531b_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23252400","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/07af8a9f-93e5-4c39-96ba-a900d880a5e1","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_006279.5(ST3GAL3):c.958G>C (p.Ala320Pro)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/39592"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"}}}},"meetsInclusionCriteria":true,"phenotypeNegativeAlleleNegative":4,"phenotypePositiveAllelePositive":4,"proband":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9ca865b9-0cab-453a-b1d7-860102e0ce81"},"sequencingMethod":{"id":"cg:AllGenesSequencing"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValiditySegregationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/84d189a6-37fd-44d9-a2cc-4910d3a6ccd5_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"In vitro functional expression studies in murine fibroblasts showed that the mutant protein was improperly localized to the endoplasmic reticulum, preventing the protein from interacting with its substrates in the Golgi, resulting in a loss of function.
