At least 6 unique missense, nonsense, and frameshift variants affecting the titin M line have been reported in 6 families. \n\nPer criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we determined the inheritance pattern, unique genetic basis (missense and truncating variants in the M line), and distinct clinical presentation of autosomal dominant tibial muscular dystrophy warranted a split curation from autosomal recessive titinopathies and from autosomal dominant hereditary myopathy with prominent resipiratory failure.\n\nEvidence ​supporting this gene-disease relationship includes ​case-level data from 6 probands in 4 publications (PMID: 12145747, PMID: 12891679, PMID: 18948003, PMID: 19911250) as well as familial segregation data (4.1 points). \n\nThis gene-disease association is also supported by biochemical and expression evidence supporting the role of *TTN* in affected tissues (PMID: 20551232, PMID: 16949617) and a mouse model of the recurrent Finnish variant (NM_003319.4:c.80585_80595delinsTGAAAGAAAAA (p.Glu26862_Trp26865delinsValLysGluLys), often referred to as FINmaj) (PMID: 20855473). \n\nIn summary, there is moderate evidence to support the relationship between *TTN* and autosomal dominant tibial muscular dystrophy. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Congenital Myopathies Gene Curation Expert Panel on 8/23/2021 (SOP Version 8).\n\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5dc0d6a2-cfeb-4b94-a7bc-3ac960234151","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ec556f45-8dbc-43f0-96df-29e69d7f3411","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ec556f45-8dbc-43f0-96df-29e69d7f3411_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10031","date":"2022-03-14T20:50:44.954Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ec556f45-8dbc-43f0-96df-29e69d7f3411_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10031","date":"2022-03-14T20:50:17.462Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ec556f45-8dbc-43f0-96df-29e69d7f3411_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8eaac764-c861-41e8-93d2-d450e6fe6ee8","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The TTN NM_001267550.2:c.107647del frameshift variant observed in heterozygosity in this proband is expected to introduce a premature termination codon (p.Ser35883fs) in the titin M line (Mex5).
