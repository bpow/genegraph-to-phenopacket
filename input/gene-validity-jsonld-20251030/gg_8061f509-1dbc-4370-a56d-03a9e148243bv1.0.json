PMID: 9683616). Affected individuals have since been identified in a number of other publications (PMID: 10676808, PMID: 26298565, PMID: 25515582), with causal monoallelic variants in *GUCY2D*. Patients typically present with pediatric onset of progressively reduced visual acuity, myopia, photophobia, color vision defects, abnormalities of retinal pigmentation, and Bull’s eye maculopathy. Electroretinogram readings indicate loss of cone responses and less severe loss of rod responses. Macular optical coherence tomography generally indicates reduced thickness of the retinal photoreceptor layers, which is accompanied by loss of cone cell density. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, these cases were compared with other diagnoses reported in association with *GUCY2D* variants. For example, cases from a large Northern Irish family linked to a monoallelic variant in *GUCY2D* have been diagnosed with central areolar choroidal dystrophy 1 (PMID: 22695961). While the associated variant is located outside of the dimerization domain, the shared mode of inheritance and phenotypic overlap led this disease entity to be combined with autosomal dominant cases of cone-rod dystrophy 6 into a single gene curation, with the lumped disease entity referred to as GUCY2D-related dominant retinopathy (MONDO:0100441). On the other hand, cases with overlapping phenotypes harboring biallelic *GUCY2D* variants have been diagnosed with autosomal recessive cone-rod dystrophy 6, Leber congenital amaurosis 1, or congenital stationary night blindness type 1I (PMID: 20517349). These cases differ in both their mode of inheritance and molecular mechanism (biallelic loss of function in the GUCY2D gene product). Therefore, recessive cases have been lumped into a separate disease entity, referred to as GUCY2D-related recessive retinopathy (MONDO: 0100453).\n\nNine suspected pathogenic variants have been scored as part of this curation (six missense variants disrupting codon 838, two additional missense variants disrupting the coiled-coil dimerization domain, and one variant in the C-terminal catalytic domain), which have been collectively reported in ten probands in six publications (PMID: 9618177, PMID: 9683616, PMID: 10676808, PMID: 26298565, PMID: 25515582, PMID: 22695961). All ten probands are heterozygous for their respective variants. One family with segregation evidence has contributed to the scoring of the gene-disease relationship (PMID: 9618177). More case-level data and families with segregation data are available in the above publications, but have not been scored as part of this curation as the maximum scoring for this evidence type has already been reached.\n\nThe mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be monoallelic *GUCY2D* dysfunction, characterized in most cases by missense variants in the region of *GUCY2D* encoding the dimerization-mediating coiled-coil domain. Nine out of ten probands found for this curation harbor a heterozygous variant allele within this region of *GUCY2D*. These substitutions are predicted to enhance the affinity of GUCY2D protein for its guanylate cyclase-activating protein GCAP-1 (GUCA1A), conferring the ability for the variant proteins to be enzymatically stimulated by GCAP-1 at higher concentrations of calcium ions than the wild-type protein (PMID: 10430891, PMID: 30319355). One of the autosomal dominant cases included in this curation harbors a heterozygous variant located outside of the dimerization-mediating domain, and will require additional functional study to confirm its mechanism of pathogenicity (PMID: 22695961).\n\nThis gene-disease association is supported by experimental evidence that *GUCY2D* expression is dramatically higher in the retina relative to control tissues (PMID: 30239781), particularly along the retinal outer nuclear layer (PMID: 1356371). Biochemical studies have demonstrated that *GUCY2D* encodes a receptor guanylyl cyclase that catalyzes cGMP production as part of the recovery of the dark state following visual excitation (PMID: 1356371). The enzymatic activity of GUCY2D protein is stimulated by the GCAP1 protein encoded by the *GUCA1A* gene, which harbors variants causal for autosomal dominant cone-rod dystrophy 3 (PMID: 10430891). Transgenic zebrafish (PMID: 23328348) and mouse models (PMID: 27703005) expressing a variant observed in affected human patients recapitulate features of the disease entity, including the mode of inheritance, electroretinogram abnormalities, retinal outer nuclear layer thinning, and photoreceptor cell loss.\n\nIn summary, *GUCY2D* is definitively associated with GUCY2D-related dominant retinopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both research and diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time without the emergence of contradictory evidence, leading to a definitive classification. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Retinal GCEP on May 27, 2022 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8061f509-1dbc-4370-a56d-03a9e148243b","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8816f73d-0432-4d50-bbb6-74a8f1da96ae","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8816f73d-0432-4d50-bbb6-74a8f1da96ae_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10072","date":"2022-05-28T19:56:16.735Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8816f73d-0432-4d50-bbb6-74a8f1da96ae_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10072","date":"2022-05-28T19:57:01.399Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8816f73d-0432-4d50-bbb6-74a8f1da96ae_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/933be791-bd77-4fc9-95b3-92cd0e8eabee","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"NM_000180.4(GUCY2D):c.2521G>A (p.Glu841Lys) is a missense variant located within the coiled-coil domain that mediates dimerization.
