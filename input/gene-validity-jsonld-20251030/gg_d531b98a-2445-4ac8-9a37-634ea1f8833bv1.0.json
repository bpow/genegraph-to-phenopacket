The *COX8A* gene encodes cytochrome *c* oxidase (complex IV) subunit 8A. Defects of this protein lead to complex IV deficiency.\n\nThe first and only case report of *COX8A*-related autosomal recessive primary mitochondrial disease was in 2016 (PMID: 26685157), in an individual from a consanguineous family with Leigh syndrome spectrum (LSS) disorder, congenital scoliosis, developmental delay, pulmonary hypertension, epilepsy, and lactic acidosis. While various names have been given to the constellation of features seen in those with *COX8A*-related disorders, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the COX8A phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework. Of note, *COX8A* was first curated by this Expert Panel for its association with LSS on June 8, 2020 (SOP V7), with a final classification of Limited. This current curation for the association with primary mitochondrial disease includes the single case included in the LSS curation.\n\nEvidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This included one intronic variant impacting splicing (PMID: 26685157) in the single reported proband.\n\nThe mechanism of disease is loss of function. This gene-disease association is also supported by the known biochemical function of COX8A as a subunit of complex IV, as well as functional alteration in non-patient cells (PMID: 33705280) and rescue in patient cells (PMID: 26685157).\n\nIn summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship given that only one case has been reported to date. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on March 18, 2024 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d531b98a-2445-4ac8-9a37-634ea1f8833b","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a1671723-9b23-4f70-b64d-dd1829b926bc","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a1671723-9b23-4f70-b64d-dd1829b926bc_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2025-01-14T18:02:03.235Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a1671723-9b23-4f70-b64d-dd1829b926bc_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2024-03-18T04:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"This classification was kept at limited given only a single case has been reported to date.
