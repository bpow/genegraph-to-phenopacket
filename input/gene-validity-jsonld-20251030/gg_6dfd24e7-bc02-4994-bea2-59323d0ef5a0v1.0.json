{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6dfd24e7-bc02-4994-bea2-59323d0ef5a0v1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"The relationship between *SLC25A10* and primary mitochondrial disease was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of November 20, 2023. *SLC25A10* encodes a dicarboxylate carrier that catalyzes the transport of dicarboxylates such as malate and succinate across the mitochondrial membrane in exchange for phosphate, sulfate, and thiosulfate. This is important for gluconeogenesis, fatty acid metabolism, urea synthesis, and sulfur metabolism, particularly in the liver.\n\nThe first and only case report of *SLC25A10*-related autosomal recessive primary mitochondrial disease was in 2018 (PMID: 29211846) in a 9-year-old male from non-consanguineous parents with epileptic encephalopathy, spasticity, elevated serum lactate and microcytic anemia. This individual had complex I deficiency and mitochondrial DNA depletion. While various names could be given to the constellation of features seen in those with *SLC25A10*-related disease, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *SLC25A10* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework.\n\nEvidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included one patient who was compound heterozygous for a nonsense variant and complex combination of variants that impacts splicing.  This gene-disease association is also supported by siRNA knockdown of *SLC25A10* in HepG2 cells showing inhibition of malate transport from mitochondrial to cytosol (PMID: 16027120) and by yeast orthologue knockout studies (PMID: 29211846).  \n\nIn summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on November 20, 2023 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6dfd24e7-bc02-4994-bea2-59323d0ef5a0","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1ef30bfb-3f90-48f7-ac02-c8286461dfc0","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1ef30bfb-3f90-48f7-ac02-c8286461dfc0_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2023-11-20T05:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1ef30bfb-3f90-48f7-ac02-c8286461dfc0_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2024-01-22T15:43:08.176Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1ef30bfb-3f90-48f7-ac02-c8286461dfc0_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3c09b7ca-6e05-4cf7-8010-dfed0e2f607a_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/37bbd81a-81d4-4fba-8654-2a2b47bb42fc","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"1.5 (nonsense default) + 0.4 (complex I deficiency) + 0.1 (common intronic variant, but RNA minigene studies)","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/37bbd81a-81d4-4fba-8654-2a2b47bb42fc_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"complex I deficiency","functionalDataSupport":"Yes"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/37bbd81a-81d4-4fba-8654-2a2b47bb42fc_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29211846","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bb75f406-dbae-4137-b169-3c3923dfde90","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_012140.5(SLC25A10):c.304A>T (p.Lys102Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA401517376"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9f343d43-179b-4baa-aaf6-bc61b7cc0f3e","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"1.5 (nonsense default) + 0.4 (complex I deficiency) + 0.1 (common intronic variant, but RNA minigene studies)\n","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9f343d43-179b-4baa-aaf6-bc61b7cc0f3e_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"complex I deficiency","functionalDataSupport":"Yes"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9f343d43-179b-4baa-aaf6-bc61b7cc0f3e_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29211846","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/34f8fb2c-6b81-45bd-95db-56e35c7613ff","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_012140.5(SLC25A10):c.[657C>T;763-37G>A] (p.Pro219=)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA658682644"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":0.1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3c09b7ca-6e05-4cf7-8010-dfed0e2f607a","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29211846","rdfs:label":"Patient II:2 Punzi et al ","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":3,"allele":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bb75f406-dbae-4137-b169-3c3923dfde90"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/34f8fb2c-6b81-45bd-95db-56e35c7613ff"}],"detectionMethod":"Three variants identified \nc.304A>T; p.
