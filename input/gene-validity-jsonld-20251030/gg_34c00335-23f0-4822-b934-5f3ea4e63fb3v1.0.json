The authors performed Next Generation Sequencing by using a 134 genes panel in order to discover a candidate disease‐causing gene. Genetic screening identified a missense variant on LDB3 causing the aminoacid substitution Thr351Ala, this variant was reported in ClinVar as conflicting interpretation (VUS, LB). This variant shows a high MAF in the general population to be associated with the disease even though the proband and family carriers do have ARVC.\nThere is disputed evidence that the identified LDB3 variant contribute to the ARVC phenotype and there is no known disease mechanism that would link LDB3 with ARVC.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/34c00335-23f0-4822-b934-5f3ea4e63fb3","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8ebdc3e8-2e0a-4a5e-8906-8e616d14008b","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8ebdc3e8-2e0a-4a5e-8906-8e616d14008b_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10003","date":"2019-09-12T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8ebdc3e8-2e0a-4a5e-8906-8e616d14008b_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10003","date":"2020-09-16T19:22:58.137Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"Only a single variant was found, and the MAF of that variant was above the ARVC EP cut-off.","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8ebdc3e8-2e0a-4a5e-8906-8e616d14008b_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8ebdc3e8-2e0a-4a5e-8906-8e616d14008b_ad_other_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ca550882-3997-4faa-8009-490a1b086314_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"low impact on gene  \n\n*Only supporting variant evidence available is weak segregation in a single family.
