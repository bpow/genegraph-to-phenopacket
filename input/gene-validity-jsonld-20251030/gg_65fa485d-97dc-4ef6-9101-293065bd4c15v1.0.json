{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/65fa485d-97dc-4ef6-9101-293065bd4c15v1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"The relationship between *NDUFB10* and primary mitochondrial disease was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of February 7, 2022. The *NDUFB10* gene encodes NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) subunit B10, which is essential for complex I activity and assembly. Defects of this protein lead to complex I deficiency.\n\nThe *NDUFB10* gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive mitochondrial disease in 2017 (PMID: 28040730). While various names have been given to the constellation of features seen in those with *NDUFB10*-related disease, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the NDUFB10 phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included three variants identified in two cases in two publications (PMIDs: 28040730, 33169436). Features seen in these cases include severe infantile lactic acidosis, cardiomyopathy, intrauterine growth restriction, and poor growth after birth, liver involvement, and sensorineural hearing loss. Both affected infants died before 12 months of age. No segregation data were available. Loss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease association is also supported by known biochemical function, functional alteration in patient cells, functional alteration in non-patient cells, and animal models (PMIDs: 19672299, 27626371, 28040730, 32025618, 27509854).\n\nIn summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on February 7, 2022 (SOP Version 8).\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/65fa485d-97dc-4ef6-9101-293065bd4c15","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2bff63e5-63a2-44fe-9a3e-561442d9c931","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2bff63e5-63a2-44fe-9a3e-561442d9c931_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2022-02-07T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2bff63e5-63a2-44fe-9a3e-561442d9c931_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2022-05-31T23:58:39.748Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2bff63e5-63a2-44fe-9a3e-561442d9c931_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2bff63e5-63a2-44fe-9a3e-561442d9c931_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/075f92e9-903f-4a5f-8f50-1609f26840db","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"0.5 point for biochemical/mitochondrial dysfunction as seen in humans, per mito GCEP guidance","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f6e14cba-e819-4161-966f-a772ad98d0ab","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Complex I activity: \nThe amc5 mutant displayed decreased rotenone-sensitive NADH: duroquinone oxidoreductase activity (Figure 5a) and exhibited the characteristic sid phenotype of complex I-deficient mutants in both liquid and solid medium (Figures 5b and S8D,E) with an average generation time of 69 hr in the dark, compared to 27 hr for the wildtype strain. Real-time RT-qPCR confirmed the loss of the wild-type NUOB10 mRNA in the amc5 mutant (Figure S8C). The amc5 mutant displayed an accumulation of a subcomplex, migrating at a size similar to the ~700 kDa subcomplex previously observed in Chlamydomonas mitochondrial mutants defective for the distal membrane arm  assembly of complex I (Cardol et al., 2008; Remacle et al., 2008; Figure 5c,d). To test whether the mutation in NUOB10 is indeed responsible for the complex I defect, the amc5 mutant was  transformed with a cosmid containing the NUOB10 gene (Figures 5 and S8). Molecular analyses of\nthe [amc5; NUOB10] transformant revealed the presence of the wildtype NUOB10 gene and restoration of relative NUOB10 transcript levels. The [amc5; NUOB10] strain also exhibited restoration of growth in the dark, complex I activity, and assembly. From these results, we conclude that the AMC5 locus corresponds to the NUOB10 gene and the NUOB10 subunit is necessary for complex I membrane arm assembly.\n\nWhile the amc5 recipient strain displayed a SID phenotype, transformants expressing the wild-type\nNUOB10-FLAG had restored growth in the dark similar to those with the NUOB10-containing cosmid.\n","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32025618","rdfs:label":"Chlamydomonas model","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2c02e483-3bb3-495f-bceb-800cb25415ce","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Scored for mitochondrial/respiration abnormality comparable to human phenotype","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/276bc328-4c69-4a2f-bbba-b0bc132a394c","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Mean respiratory control ratio (RCR) is significantly decreased compared to wildtype","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19672299","rdfs:label":"C elegans","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2bff63e5-63a2-44fe-9a3e-561442d9c931_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/180d9fda-a93a-4aea-a8f2-0cfb498ca6db","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Trace amounts of complex I intermediates (230 kDa, 400 kDa, 460 kDa, 630 kDa,\nand 830 kDa) seen in FCL (as well as muscle and liver).","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/eed7503c-183c-407b-8c9e-46e35652de88","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Trace amounts of complex I intermediates (230 kDa, 400 kDa, 460 kDa, 630 kDa,\nand 830 kDa) seen in FCL (as well as muscle and liver).","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28040730","rdfs:label":"Complex I assembly assay in patient FCL"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/33e85527-54ef-4e3f-8de1-435fa7fa6773","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"In fibroblasts enzyme activities and complex assembly appeared normal.

In addition to the cryptic exon, reads mapping along the length of intron 1 were enriched in I‐1 relative to controls, suggesting that intron 1 may be retained in some transcripts. The inclusion of exon 1A would result in a frameshift p.(Arg43fs*32), while intron retention would be predicted to introduce a premature termination sequence p.(Arg43fs*135) to this transcript, with both events expected to be subjected to NMD leading to an overall reduced level of NDUFB10 in this individual.\n\nTo determine if the c.131‐442G>C variant was responsible for the observed NDUFB10 splicing defect we generated a minigene splicing reporter by cloning 2.1 kb of genomic sequence, including exon 1 to exon 3 of NDUFB10, into the mammalian expression vector pEYFP‐C1. Primer\ndirected mutagenesis was used to generate a version of the plasmid containing the c.131‐442G>C variant before transfection into human embryonic kidney (HEK293T) cells (Tables S2 and S3). Amplification of RNA transcribed from both the mutant and wild‐type plasmids by RT‐PCR using primers between exon 1 and exon 2 of NDUFB10 yielded an amplicon consistent with the size expected from reference NDUFB10 splicing (Figure 1d; Table S4). A second approximately 100‐nt larger amplicon was generated only by the mutant plasmid, consistent with the aberrant splicing observed by RNA sequencing in I‐1.\n\nWe sought to determine if the aberrant NDUFB10 splicing affects the overall stability of Complex I or other mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes. Immunoblotting was performed using an antibody against one subunit of each of the five mitochondrial OXPHOS complexes on cell lysates isolated from a fibroblast sample from I‐1, an affected patient control with known complex I deficiency due to a homozygous variant in NDUFB3 (MIM# 603839; Calvo et al., 2012) and three control samples. This revealed an absence of the Complex I subunit NDUFB8 and normal levels of the remaining mitochondrial OXPHOS complexes relative to controls (Figure 2a), consistent with\nan isolated Complex I defect.\n\nMoreover, the abundance of the majority of Complex I subunits were decreased in I‐1 relative to  controls while the levels of other mitochondrial respiratory chain complex subunits remained relatively unchanged (Figure 2b,c). These results are largely consistent with our previously reported study of a HEK293T cell line gene‐edited to lack expression of NDUFB10 (Stroud et al., 2016),\nsuggesting the effect of the variant in I‐1 leads to similar defects in assembly of the complex (Figure S3\n\nScore: 1.5 predicted null with shown splicing defects + 0.5 (severe complex I defect/decreased complex I subunits shown in patient cells) = 2\n","functionalDataSupport":"Yes"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5e73c424-163a-42fa-9bf6-addfe6c26d8f_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33169436","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/269a022f-0206-4f31-8c5f-c0c2fa679a98","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_004548.3(NDUFB10):c.131-442G>C","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/873018"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":4},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ea5bf108-d8a6-4256-b34c-7ef8f04ed3f5","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33169436","rdfs:label":"Individual 1 (I-1)","ageType":"AgeAtDeath","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":11,"allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/269a022f-0206-4f31-8c5f-c0c2fa679a98"},"detectionMethod":"RNA sequencing: Differential expression analysis identified a greater than threefold reduction in expression of the nuclear encoded mitochondrial gene NDUFB10 relative to 24 similarly sequenced controls (Log2 fold change −1.86; p‐adj = 9.058787e−06 [Figure 1a; Table S6]); Inspection of the reads mapping to NDUFB10 identified two novel splicing events, both of which are expected to be subjected to NMD","firstTestingMethod":"Other","phenotypeFreeText":"Poor growth noted by 5 months, high frequency SNHL noted at 7 weeks old, developed good head control/smiled/bright/alert by 3 months old, continued to make developmental gains at 9 months (babbling/attentive to voices), multiple admissions due to growth/feeding/abnormal posturing/breathing dificulty; admitted at 11 months for episodes of increasing apnea requiring intubation and died\n\nAlso had elevated blood lactate (3.5 mmol/L; normal <1.8), borderline low complex I activity in muscle (relative to CS and CII, ~40% residual), also low in liver; Brain MRI at 9 months old showed  signal abnormalities in the brainstem with T2 hyperintensity and T1 hypo-intensity suggesting demyelination in the corticonuclear tracts within the cerebral peduncles and affecting the inferior colliculi (Figure S1:1A-1B); periaqueductal midbrain was affected; prominence of the ventricles and extra-axial spaces.
