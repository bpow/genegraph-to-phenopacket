The specific disease entity, primary ciliary dyskinesia 33 (MONDO:0014750, OMIM:605178), is one of at least 45 different primary ciliary dyskinesias distinguished by a single monogenic cause. Many of the probands displayed respiratory symptoms including sinusitis, productive cough, bronchitis, pneumonia and otitis media during childhood. Other common patient phenotypes included bronchiectasis, decreased nasal nitric oxide, abnormal ciliary motility, and ciliary defects (primarily nexin-dynein regulatory complex defects or outer microtubular pair disorganization). Situs inversus was not present in any of them.\n\nThis curation includes six variants (five nonsense, one canonical splice site) that have been reported in seven probands in four publications (PMIDs: 26387594, 37950557, 27120127, 38873586). Biallelic loss-of-function was identified as the suspected mechanism of pathogenicity.\n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by multiple forms of experimental evidence ranging from biochemical and expression evidence to mouse, zebrafish, *Chlamydomonas*, and *Trypanosoma* models (PMIDs:19043402, 27472056, 37975235, 12847082, 37975235 and 35071054). GAS8 loss was observed in human airway cells from a PCD patient with disease-causing variants in *CCDC65* (PMID: 37975235). GAS8 is similar to CCDC65 in that both proteins are located in the nexin-dynein regulatory complex (PMID: 37975235), and variants in *CCDC65* have similarly been asserted in relation to primary ciliary dyskinesia 27. A *Trypanosoma cruzi* model with loss of the GAS8 ortholog has affected flagella with ultrastructural defects similar to the cilia of human probands (PMID: 35071054). The *Chlamydomonas* ortholog of the GAS8 protein, PF2, shows immunolocalization specifically to the flagella of wild-type cells (PMID: 12847082). The *Chlamydomonas* model of PF2 loss demonstrated abnormal ciliary motility and a ciliary ultrastructural defect in the nexin-dynein regulatory complex (N-DRC) consistent with the localization data, which could be rescued by the wild-type gene (PMID: 12847082). The zebrafish phenotypes of hydrocephalus and otolith defects were consistent with ciliary dysfunction and fluid buildup (PMID:19043402). Finally, the mice exhibited hydrocephalus and ciliary defects matching those observed in the human patients (PMID: 27472056).\n\nIn conclusion, *GAS8* is definitively associated with primary ciliary dyskinesia 33. This classification has been clearly demonstrated and confirmed through both experimental and genetic evidence and has been upheld over time without the emergence of conflicting evidence. This classification was approved by the Motile Ciliopathy Gene Curation Expert Panel on November 8th, 2024 (SOP version 11).","*GAS8* was first described as a primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD)-causing gene in 2015 (Olbrich et al., PMID: 26387594).

After insertion of grommets, he had suffered from purulent otorrhea for several months. Audiometry revealed conductive hearing loss without signs of inner ear impairment. Computed tomography of the lungs at the age of 7 years demonstrated consolidation of the middle and lingual lobes with early bronchiectasis. His nasal NO production rate was low (100 nl/min), consistent with PCD.\n\nAdditionally, TEM of the patient's cilia showed some ultrastructure defects.","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0006532","obo:HP_0002837","obo:HP_0011109","obo:HP_0000403","obo:HP_0012262","obo:HP_0012258","obo:HP_0031245","obo:HP_0002110","obo:HP_0033036","obo:HP_0000365","obo:HP_0011463"],"sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fa14efab-2c53-4f0d-946e-dafeb0b1a40e_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26387594","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/40784158-6ee6-473c-b2aa-feb435812be3"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"}}},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fa14efab-2c53-4f0d-946e-dafeb0b1a40e","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Downscored due to sequencing methods and small village origin/possible consanguinity.","calculatedScore":3.0,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fa14efab-2c53-4f0d-946e-dafeb0b1a40e_variant_evidence_item"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":1.0}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria","strengthScore":1.0}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":10},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d34bf201-5f6d-41c0-842d-5c029823ef60_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d34bf201-5f6d-41c0-842d-5c029823ef60_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c771d1b5-c39f-40e7-be41-67115c7bfa32","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3ab9d77c-f551-4000-b7b5-666714d660bb","type":"Finding","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37975235","rdfs:label":"Jreijiri et al. 2023","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionB"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/146d9f36-fd7a-46a7-a225-7da3a673c555","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d3306a13-99b5-4178-8849-80f2b083ea76","type":"Finding","dc:description":"As seen in Figures 5B and 5D), the absence of the GAS8 equivalent (\"PF2\") causes ciliary beating defects.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12847082","rdfs:label":"Rupp et al. 2003","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c792477f-9993-4a2a-abbf-d0a6d51bbd25","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Downscored to avoid potential double counting of evidence.","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c4f21919-5683-4207-8880-b5f435cd885d","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Both GAS8 and CCDC65 are both involved with cilia formation in the Nexin-Dynein Regulatory Complex.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37975235","rdfs:label":"Jreijiri et al. 2023","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionA"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d34bf201-5f6d-41c0-842d-5c029823ef60_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1e500dce-08dc-428e-ad2e-c08d693f63b4","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Lack of similarity between model and human probands","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f3cb5bf3-1cac-4ee7-ade0-0147bbecbf7c","type":"Finding","dc:description":" The ciliary structures in the WT and Rescue are better defined than the knockouts in 3b and 3c.
