Additional findings in some individuals may include growth failure, dysmorphic facial features, hypotonia and/or hypertonia, and cardiac and skeletal abnormalities. Syndromic microphthalmia (Lenz microphthalmia syndrome) has been reported in males with *NAA10* variants resulting in decreased mRNA (splice, frameshift and polyadenylation signal variants) (PMID: 30842225). Numerous unique variants in *NAA10*, mostly missense, have been reported, with some variants occurring *de novo*. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 22 probands in 6 publications (PMIDs: 21700266, 24431331, 25099252, 26522270, 31127942, 35039925).

As of January 10th, 2023, this record underwent administrative updates to include minor edits to the evidence summary text and update scoring to be consistent with SOP Version 9.
