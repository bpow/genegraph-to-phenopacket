BWS (initially described in 1988 by Baraitser and Winter) is characterized by distinct facial features (the combination of congenital ptosis, high-arched eyebrows, hypertelorism, ocular coloboma) and cerebral malformations ( anterior-predominant lissencephaly, microcephaly) with other abnormalities. Phenotypic variability has been reported.  The mechanism of pathogenicity is known to be de novo gain-of-function. Interestingly, loss -of -function variants in this gene have been purported to cause a different neurodevelopmental disorder (described in PMID: 29220674); these variants were not considered as part of this curation. At least eleven missense variants have been reported in 18 probands with BWS across six publications (PMIDs: 23756437, 23649928, 22366783, 29388391, 25052316, 16685646).  This gene-disease relationship is also supported by a G-actin polymerization assay with yeast (PMID 23649928), in vitro functional assays, and immunofluorescence staining with patient derived lymphoblastoid cell (PMIDs: 22366783, 16685646). In summary, ACTB is definitively associated with autosomal dominant Baraitser-Winter syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This was approved by  the ClinGen Brain Malformations GCEP on October 26, 2021.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/14e65fae-0e2f-4ad4-812d-cbd7c7be2603","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fa13dfad-ab93-4521-874a-5ede8f608fe4","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fa13dfad-ab93-4521-874a-5ede8f608fe4_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10020","date":"2021-10-26T16:58:35.977Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fa13dfad-ab93-4521-874a-5ede8f608fe4_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10020","date":"2021-11-04T16:11:51.173Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fa13dfad-ab93-4521-874a-5ede8f608fe4_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c9b5fb5e-c3f9-457b-8e6c-13385e9c343b","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c9b5fb5e-c3f9-457b-8e6c-13385e9c343b_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22366783","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/82acec5b-7015-48d6-9799-1fa3a22acec7","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001101.5(ACTB):c.586C>T

The E117K mutant cells were almost completely resistant to the concentrations of drug tested, suggesting that the E117K mutation might result in strengthened actin monomer–monomer interactions and increased filament stability. E117K mutation in β-actin falls in a system of residues consisting of a helix (residues 113–118), which appears to interact across the strand–strand interface of the actin filament with residues 256 and 195 in another monomer. In dynamic light scattering analysis, WT G-actin behaves as a stable population of 43 kD monomers. The behavior of the E117K mutant “monomer” solution, however, was much different.
