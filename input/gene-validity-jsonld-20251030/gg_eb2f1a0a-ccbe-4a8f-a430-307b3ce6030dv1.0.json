Cases with *THG1L* variants have been reported with a variety of phenotypes that can include but are not limited to: cerebellar ataxia, cerebellar atrophy or hypoplasia, global developmental delay, and seizures. Dysmorphic features like microcephaly and micrognathia have been reported but in a minority of cases. Five variants (4 missense and 1 splice-region) that have been reported in eight probands in five publications (PMIDs: 27307223, 30214071, 31168944, 33682303, 37670026) are included in this curation. Two families were observed with variation in *THG1L* where an ataxia-like disease segregated with the variants (PMIDs: 27307223, 33682303). The mechanism of pathogenicity is unclear but thought to be loss of function leading to abnormalities in mitochondrial localization and morphology (PMID: 27307223). No conclusive experimental evidence was found to support this gene-disease relationship in a literature review. In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Cerebellar Ataxia GCEP on the meeting date September 10, 2025 (SOP Version 11).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/eb2f1a0a-ccbe-4a8f-a430-307b3ce6030d","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c1568d1e-8fef-4666-80e1-7cee60e94863","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c1568d1e-8fef-4666-80e1-7cee60e94863_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10155","date":"2025-09-10T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c1568d1e-8fef-4666-80e1-7cee60e94863_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10155","date":"2025-09-25T17:03:52.196Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c1568d1e-8fef-4666-80e1-7cee60e94863_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c1568d1e-8fef-4666-80e1-7cee60e94863_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c2c27632-4bd0-4e4a-b05a-d1a6129a7a32","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The negative control growth differed from what was expected -
