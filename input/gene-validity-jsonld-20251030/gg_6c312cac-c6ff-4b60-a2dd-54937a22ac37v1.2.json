Common phenotypes include mild to moderate intellectual disability, variable behavioral abnormalities, and dysmorphic facial features with coarsening that becomes more apparent with age. The majority of variants are *de novo*, although in at least one individual the variant was inherited from a mildly affected mother (PMID: 35813374). Heterozygous truncating variants in seven patients, reported in three publications, are included in this curation (PMIDs: 26238514, 28124119, 35813374).

This gene-disease relationship is also supported by biochemical function, protein interaction, a mouse model and *in vitro* functional assays. ARID2 is an intrinsic component of polybromo brahma-associated factor (PBAF), a SWI/SNF subcomplex involved in chromatin remodeling. *Arid2* haploinsufficient mice exhibit learning and memory deficits in the Morris water maze and reduced body size (PMID: 33051312). *ARID2* haploinsufficiency also enhanced RAS-MAPK pathway activity in vitro (PMID: 33051312). \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between *ARID2* and autosomal dominant Coffin-Siris syndrome.
