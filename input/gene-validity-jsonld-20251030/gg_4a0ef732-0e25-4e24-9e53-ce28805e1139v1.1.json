Since PTPN11 is Definitively associated with Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines, this case should not be counted and therefore the PTPN11 association with CFC is Disputed. Of note, PTPN11 has also been classified as Definitive in association with Noonan syndrome (NS) and as Disputed in association with Costello syndrome. The ClinGen RASopathy Expert Panel found no evidence associating PTPN11 with NS-like disorder with loose anagen hair. This curation was approved by the ClinGen RASopathy Gene Curation Expert Panel on 5/30/18 (SOP Version 5).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4a0ef732-0e25-4e24-9e53-ce28805e1139","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a1a2133e-4ce8-45b7-87da-1c52990d3890","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"NoKnownDiseaseRelationship","changes":{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a1a2133e-4ce8-45b7-87da-1c52990d3890_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10021","date":"2021-03-09T21:10:16.670Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a1a2133e-4ce8-45b7-87da-1c52990d3890_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10021","date":"2018-05-30T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"Only case found presented with multiple lentigines later in life and should be considered an NSML patient instead.","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a1a2133e-4ce8-45b7-87da-1c52990d3890_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a1a2133e-4ce8-45b7-87da-1c52990d3890_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a1a2133e-4ce8-45b7-87da-1c52990d3890_ad_dn_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/771dcbb1-06ae-4466-a057-7dc38a615f0d_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"variant absent from gnomAD This patient presented with ML at age 15.
