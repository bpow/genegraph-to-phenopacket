The hallmark of the disease is presence of periodic acid-Schiff-positive polyglucosan inclusion bodies, called Lafora bodies. Mainly two genes, EPM2A and NHLRC1, have been associated with LD. LD was first reported to be associated with EPM2A in 1998 in a study that identified seven EPM2A variants in ten families (Minassian et al. 1998. PMID: 9771710). Since then, 32 deletions/insertions/frameshifts, 13 nonsense, and 57 missense variants have been identified in LD patients according to the Lafora Progressive Myoclonus Epilepsy Mutation and Polymorphism Database (http://projects.tcag.ca/lafora/). Nineteen symptomatic probands from 19 families with homozygous or compound heterozygous EPM2A variants studied by six studies were scored for genetic evidence (PMID: 9771710, 9931343, 11175283, 12019207, 12560877, 14722920). While many of the variants were unique to each family, one variant, c. 721C>T; p.Arg241* in NM_005670.3, has a relatively high occurrence due to both founder effect and recurrence verified by a haplotype study (11175283). Nine probands had two variants in trans that were not predicted/proven to be null, and were given scores ranging from 0 to 1. The remaining ten probands had at least one of the two variants in trans that were proven/predicted to be null, and were given scores ranging from 1 to 2. Functional studies rather than presence of Lafora bodies were used to upgrade the points for some studies (9771710, 9931343, 11175283, 12560877), because presence of Lafora bodies were documented only as a study inclusion statement in the methods section, and/or only EPM2A was studied. No LOD scores could be calculated from these families, because only single affected individual was reported for each case. Supporting experimental evidence includes expression (11355878), protein interaction (15930137), non-human model organism (12019206), and rescue in non-human model organism (24430976). In summary, a score of 12 was given to genetic evidence, and 4 to experimental evidence, reaching 16 in total. EPM2A’s association with LD is upgraded from strong to definitive, because it has been replicated for more than 2 decades.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0e387047-20f9-4ccd-bb02-94953bb207b0","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f970ced6-0164-41ed-9e1f-1fb9f892bca6","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f970ced6-0164-41ed-9e1f-1fb9f892bca6_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10005","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f970ced6-0164-41ed-9e1f-1fb9f892bca6_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10005","date":"2020-05-23T19:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f970ced6-0164-41ed-9e1f-1fb9f892bca6_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f970ced6-0164-41ed-9e1f-1fb9f892bca6_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bab491bb-63c4-4381-8347-cb324236904f","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0fd25621-0d03-4fca-bcec-5ff09647ad99","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Presence of spontaeneous myoclonic epilepsy, Lafora bodies in both brain and liver, neurodegeneration, behavioral deterioration apparent in progressive ataxia, muscle weakness, and startle responses that do not habituate, as well as deficit in retention of passive avoidance of electric shock.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12019206","rdfs:label":"EPM2A knock-out mouse","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/335c42a1-bef5-43ac-b231-aaf7c52a6b67","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Only Lafora bodies were observed.

Cyclohexamide caused reduction in the variant protein, but Actinomycin D had very little effects, suggesting that the protein level i regulated at protein level rather than transcription level. Then they found out that this apparent reduction in protein level was due to aggregation of variant Laforin rendering them insoluble. By Western blotting by anti-ubiquitin, they found that Laforin aggregates are polyubiquitinated. They confirmed this by co-expressing variant Laforin with HA-ubiquitin, and immunoprecipitating by anti-V5 or anti-Myc, the tags fused to Laforin constructs. Then the immunoprecipitates were detected in Western blots by anti-HA. Then they also did immunohistochemistry using anti-V5 on HEK293 cells and Neuro2A cells transfected by V5-Laforin variants.

They claim in the text that they found a 3.2 kbp transcript in all tissue tested (including heart, brain, liver, and skeletal muscle). However, the band in liver is very weak on the picture, and it is not clear whether the signal is a leakage from Skeletal muscle or a true signal. The brain signal is also weak, although they found positive signals in many brain areas.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9771710","rdfs:label":"Northern blot of human tissues","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d86dc759-18a5-45a0-af76-36cb1a36425a","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Increased glycogen synthase and its increased activity in the EPM2A and NHLRC1 knockout mice may not cause Lafora body formation as has been shown in Tiberia et al. 2012 PMID: 22669944","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7f30d77e-9e68-4655-b829-d6edc2fa3a2a","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Lafora bodies, inclusion bodies present in several tissues as as the brain, liver, muscle, and the skin are the hallmark of this disease.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17952067","rdfs:label":"Laforin/Malin inhibit PTG-mediated glycogen synthesis","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ae30c187-ef19-4e12-9ed0-23c411b25502","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The interaction was shown by three methods, yeast two hybrid, Pull-down, and immunoprecipitation.","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d03c312e-6268-4ca2-aa41-77d232d5d8fd","type":"Finding","dc:description":"NHLRC1 is the only other gene that has been associated with Lafora disease.
