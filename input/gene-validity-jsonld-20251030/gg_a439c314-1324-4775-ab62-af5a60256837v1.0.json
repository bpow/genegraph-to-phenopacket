At least 1 unique variant (missense) has been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 1 proband in 1 publication (PMID: 26196677). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 8 additional family members. This gene-disease association is supported by an expression study and in vitro functional assay. In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hearing Loss Working Group on 2/6/2020.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a439c314-1324-4775-ab62-af5a60256837","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/29172723-c896-4cbf-a20b-9921fc72547f","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/29172723-c896-4cbf-a20b-9921fc72547f_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/29172723-c896-4cbf-a20b-9921fc72547f_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2020-04-21T19:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/29172723-c896-4cbf-a20b-9921fc72547f_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/29172723-c896-4cbf-a20b-9921fc72547f_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/56df83bd-0e95-46d5-a606-16f9a9a5feaf","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/660e2ce8-bae4-4a9c-9dbc-9a2e402bbda2","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"WT MCM2-transfected cells had significantly fewer apoptotic cells after 48h than mutant MCM2-transfected culture, and both were significantly higher than the culture that lacked exogenous MCM2.
