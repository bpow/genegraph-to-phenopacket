At least eight unique variants (nonsense, frameshift, and deletion) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 6 probands in 6 publications (PMIDs: 26296490, 31604653, 10952871, 25430424, 24689076, 29792937). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 16 additional family members. The mechanism for disease is homozygous, or compound heterozygous, loss of function. This gene-disease relationship is supported by its biochemical function in muscle contraction, expression in skeletal muscle, functional alteration in non-patient cells, and models in both zebrafish and mouse. In summary, TNNT1 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive nemaline myopathy 5. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.\n\nOf note, this gene has also been implicated in autosomal dominant nemaline myopathy. These have been assessed separately. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found differences in molecular mechanism (loss of function versus potential gain of function), inheritance pattern (autosomal recessive versus autosomal dominant), and phenotypic variability (the missense autosomal dominant mutation results in a mild phenotype with considerable clinical heterogeneity, whereas the recessive truncating and internal deletion mutations with loss of function are associated with severe, early‐onset phenotypes). Therefore, we have split curations for the disease entities, autosomal dominant nemaline myopathy and autosomal recessive nemaline myopathy 5.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9a233be2-c668-43fa-91cb-44251daef27d","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8f993d88-c2f6-42c8-8c2e-c1bb63e1416a","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8f993d88-c2f6-42c8-8c2e-c1bb63e1416a_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10031","date":"2020-09-16T19:23:10.932Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8f993d88-c2f6-42c8-8c2e-c1bb63e1416a_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10031","date":"2020-05-07T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8f993d88-c2f6-42c8-8c2e-c1bb63e1416a_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5dadad23-66c3-4de3-8c1f-013eac508507_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The homozygous nonsense variant Ser108Ter is predicted to result in either NMD or a truncated transcript missing the sequence for the C-terminal 155 amino acids of the Troponin T1 protein, which represent the binding sites crucial for correct assembly of the troponin complex.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/41cf2004-f8f0-4223-b8fd-e9f58a2490b7","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25430424","rdfs:label":"Hispanic Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":2,"detectionMethod":"Neuromuscular disease panel of 42 genes involves NGS-based analysis of all exons along with Sange fill-in of low coverage exons.

These results suggest that muscle cell-specific protein degradation is responsible for the absence of truncated slow TnT protein in patient muscle.  Additionally, binding of the truncated slow TnT to tropomyosin is almost non-detectable in a solid phase protein binding assay, whereas a saturable binding was found between intact slow TnT and tropomyosin. This result supports a hypothesis that the two-site binding to tropomyosin is necessary to anchor TnT and the rest of the troponin complex to the thin filament.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15665378","rdfs:label":"Tropomyosin binding"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8f993d88-c2f6-42c8-8c2e-c1bb63e1416a_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e1d3ab75-f4d8-4497-9a2e-37903a3f8651","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Clarified the cooperativity in the interactions of troponin T   with tropomyosin, troponin  I, and troponin C in relation to   their binding locations.

Troponin C bound to troponin T subfragments Ca2+-dependently and its binding site was a relatively broad region including the N-terminal half of troponin T subfragment T2.
