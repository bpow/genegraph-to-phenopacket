At least 46 unique variants (e.g. missense, nonsense, frameshift, splice site, etc) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 17 probands in 4 publications (PMIDs: 21765411, 21765412, 21765413, 23100277). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 15 family members. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12pts) has been reached. This gene-disease relationship is supported by its expression in relevant tissues (PMID: 21765411) and the functional alteration observed in patient cells which address the  causes of reduced platelet count and increased platelet size that characterize GPS (PMID: 26987485). Further support is provided by animal models in zebrafish (PMID: 21765411), and strong recapitulation of GPS in a mouse model (PMID: 23861251). In summary, NBEAL2 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive inheritance of gray platelet syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1c767179-c29a-483f-9cab-791a0e7960d4","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ae8bd4d6-8810-423b-83e0-98667f06426d","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ae8bd4d6-8810-423b-83e0-98667f06426d_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ae8bd4d6-8810-423b-83e0-98667f06426d_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2019-06-26T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ae8bd4d6-8810-423b-83e0-98667f06426d_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ae8bd4d6-8810-423b-83e0-98667f06426d_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/37cc60e6-0e14-48b5-ae01-8984810a701a","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Abnormal α-granule formation in Nbeal2−/− mice has deleterious effects on megakaryocyte survival, development, and platelet production as in GPS patients.
