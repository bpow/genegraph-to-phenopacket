The *MT-TV* gene encodes the mitochondrial transfer RNA (tRNA) for valine. Defects of this tRNA lead to impaired mitochondrial translation, which leads to decreased synthesis of mtDNA-encoded subunits of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes I, III, IV, and V and thus impaired OXPHOS enzyme activities.\n\nThe *MT-TV* gene was first reported in relation to maternally inherited Leigh syndrome spectrum in 1997 (PMID: 9270602). This curation included 3 variants in 6 cases (2 with m.1624C>T, 3 with m.1644G>T, and 1 with m.1659T>C) from 5 publications (PMIDs: 9270602, 11799391, 15465092, 23063709, 24691472). Segregation information is scored as case level evidence according to the criteria established by the Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel. Loss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease association is also supported by known biochemical function (PMID: 27977873). \n\nIn summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on April 14, 2021 (SOP Version 8).\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b5078ee8-c6ac-48d7-a61b-82c836e2ebdb","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/42f2fc91-c26d-416c-8d93-448e4a52983b","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/42f2fc91-c26d-416c-8d93-448e4a52983b_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2022-07-06T18:48:33.462Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/42f2fc91-c26d-416c-8d93-448e4a52983b_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2021-04-14T04:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/42f2fc91-c26d-416c-8d93-448e4a52983b_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/42f2fc91-c26d-416c-8d93-448e4a52983b_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2ddad580-e763-48e9-8fa9-7353ce71bdd8","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"per rubric: More than 10 gene with a related function","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a42ecd6c-6b7b-41ea-a2d4-bb36c2103271","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Rahman et al. reviews all genes associated with Leigh syndrome in Leigh Map 2017 (PMID: 27977873).
