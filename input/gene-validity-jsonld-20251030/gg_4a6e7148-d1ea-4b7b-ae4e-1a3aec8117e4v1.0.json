Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found a difference in inheritance pattern and phenotypic variability among these diseases. Therefore, the following disease entities have been split into separate disease entities: semi-dominant ALS (OMIM: 105400), autosomal recessive retinal dystrophy with macular staphyloma (OMIM: 617547) and autosomal recessive axial spondylometaphyseal dysplasia (OMIM: 602271). The association between *CFAP410* and ALS was first established in a genome-wide variant case-control analysis that identified an association between a risk variant in the gene, described as rs75087725 (Val58Leu), and the phenotype based on the genome sequencing of 12,577 ALS cases and 23,475 controls (van Rheenen et al., PMID:27455348). Per criteria set by the ALS GCEP, the missense variant found in this study is outside the established gnomAD minor allele frequency cutoffs (<0.00005) and, while is unlikely to be a main cause of disease, reached a level of significance. To date, no causal variants in *CFAP410* have been documented in ALS patients in the literature. The mechanism of pathogenicity is currently unclear. This gene-disease association is supported by experimental evidence describing expression of* CFAP410* in neuronal tissues, physical interaction with known ALS associated gene *NEK1* and functional alterations in non-patient cells (PMIDs: 36131690, 26290490, and 32891887). In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. It is important to understand that in the clinical diagnostic setting the identification of variants of uncertain significance may be common and variant interpretation must be completed with caution. This classification was approved by the ClinGen ALS GCEP on December 12, 2023.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4a6e7148-d1ea-4b7b-ae4e-1a3aec8117e4","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bde7edf1-ccfa-443e-a917-cf3d2dd9cba6","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bde7edf1-ccfa-443e-a917-cf3d2dd9cba6_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10096","date":"2023-12-12T18:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bde7edf1-ccfa-443e-a917-cf3d2dd9cba6_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10096","date":"2024-06-05T03:17:17.020Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bde7edf1-ccfa-443e-a917-cf3d2dd9cba6_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bde7edf1-ccfa-443e-a917-cf3d2dd9cba6_cc_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d7513e2c-5821-4fc1-8c6e-c89429de3409","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"This variant is really common","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d7513e2c-5821-4fc1-8c6e-c89429de3409_cc_evidence_item","type":"Finding","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27455348","rdfs:label":"Risk Variant analysis","caseCohort":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/193545e5-7ae4-4524-b7c2-279d0c11989c","type":"Cohort","allGenotypedSequenced":12577,"alleleFrequency":0.01987755426572315,"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d7513e2c-5821-4fc1-8c6e-c89429de3409_cc_evidence_item"}],"numWithVariant":250,"relatedCondition":{"id":"obo:MONDO_0004976"}},"controlCohort":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/68c92421-97e0-4cf7-9c2d-0634737eb539","type":"Cohort","allGenotypedSequenced":23475,"alleleFrequency":0.01448349307774228,"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d7513e2c-5821-4fc1-8c6e-c89429de3409_cc_evidence_item"}],"numWithVariant":340},"lowerConfidenceLimit":1.28,"method":{"id":"cg:SingleVariantAnalysis"},"pValue":2.65E-9,"statisticalSignificanceType":"","statisticalSignificanceValue":1.45,"statisticalSignificanceValueType":"Odds Ratio","upperConfidenceLimit":1.65}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCaseControlSingleVariantAnalysisCriteria","strengthScore":3.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallCaseControlEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":3.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":3.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bde7edf1-ccfa-443e-a917-cf3d2dd9cba6_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bde7edf1-ccfa-443e-a917-cf3d2dd9cba6_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/03348138-ff97-4434-bc6b-ee7a019d7f9b","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3a66df5b-ea02-46ad-8fec-2257a4a720e8","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"FBXO3 bound to C21ORF2(WT), whereas FBXO3 did not bind to C21ORF2(V58L) and the mutant protein was not ubiquitylated in HEK293T cells, suggesting that FBXO3 is the only ubiquitin ligase for C21ORF2 and that the ALS-related V58L mutation prevents the ubiquitylation of C21ORF2.
