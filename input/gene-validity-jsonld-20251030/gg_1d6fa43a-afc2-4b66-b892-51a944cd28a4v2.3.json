It localizes primarily at centrioles and centriolar satellites, and basal bodies, and is involved in stabilizing centrioles and ensuring proper cilia assembly. Most reported OFD1 variants are loss of function (indels with frameshift) and are inherited in an X-linked dominant manner. OFD1 has been associated with 5 different diseases: Retinitis pigmentosa 23, Joubert syndrome 10 (XL-JS), Orofaciodigital syndrome I (OFD1), Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome, type 2 (SGBS2) and Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD). Intra-familial variability within these diseases has been reported and X inactivation studies have shown that skewed X inactivation could be partially involved in the pathogenesis of intrafamilial clinical variability.\nOFD1 interacts with the LCA5-encoded protein lebercilin. Mutations in LCA5 cause the Leber's congenital amaurosis (LCA), a rare inherited eye disease. The destabilization of lebercilin in conditions of OFD1 deficiency might be the basis of Retinitis pigmentosa 23 diagnoses in these patients.\nThere is an inverse correlation between OFD1 mutant protein length and phenotypic severity, which could be explained by differences in binding to functionally interacting proteins and disruption of ciliary localization. All mutations before amino acid residue 631 are lethal for males and cause OFD1 syndrome in females. The SGBS2-associated p.E709fs mutation causes macrocephaly and early death in males but it leaves females unaffected. Male patients with the p.K948fs and p.E923fs mutations have JS and may live beyond the age of 30 years, whereas carrier females are not affected. In addition, variants in exons 20 and 21 have been associated with PCD with or without additional characteristics of JS, in male patients. To our knowledge, no female patients with PCD have been reported with variants in OFD1.\nBased on this data, the ID/Autism EP and the Motile Ciliopathies GCEP decided to lump together the OFD1, SGBS2, XL-JS and PCD disease assertions under OFD1-related ciliopathy, a MONDO Disease Ontology that is inclusive of all four assertions. This decision has been made as OFD1 mutations cause Ciliopathy with differing severity of phenotype (OFD1 > SGBS2 > XL-JS > PCD, OFD1 being the most severe); the phenotype depends on the position of the stop codon. Early stop variants likely correspond with the absence of protein because of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (MND).\nRegarding the correlation of OFD1 and XLID, in Del Giudice et al. 2014 (PMID: 24884629) the authors identified patients displaying neurological symptoms and/or cognitive/behavioral abnormalities, brain structural anomalies in 88.7%, cognitive impairment in 68%, and associated neurological disorders and signs in 53% of cases. The most frequently observed structural brain anomalies included agenesis of the corpus callosum, neuronal migration/organization disorders, intracerebral cysts, porencephaly, and cerebellar malformations. The results from Del Giudice et al. 2014 support recently published findings indicating that CNS involvement in this condition is found in more than 60% of cases. Additionally, the authors described specific neuropsychological aspects such as reduced ability processing verbal information, slow thought process, difficulties in attention and concentration, and notably, long-term memory deficits which may indicate a specific role of OFD1 and/or primary cilia in higher brain functions. Thus the association of ODF1 and OFD1-related ciliopathy is definitive.","The OFD1 protein is a key regulator of ciliogenesis, both of primary and motile cilia.

Most reported OFD1 variants are loss of function (indels with frameshift) and are inherited in an X-linked dominant manner. OFD1 has been associated with 4 different diseases: Retinitis pigmentosa 23, Joubert syndrome 10 (XL-JS), Orofaciodigital syndrome I (OFD1) and Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD). Simpson–Golabi–Behmel syndrome, type 2 has previously been associated with OFD1 (PMID: 16783569) but this association has been disputed (PMID: 29057530, 26545172) and has not been included in the lumped curation, pending further evidence. Intra-familial variability within these diseases has been reported and X inactivation studies have shown that skewed X inactivation could be partially involved in the pathogenesis of intrafamilial clinical variability.
