Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping & Splitting Working Group, the mode of inheritance (autosomal recessive) and molecular mechanism (biallelic *BBS2* loss of function) have been found to be consistent among patients diagnosed with either Bardet-Biedl syndrome 2 (MIM#: 606151) or retinitis pigmentosa 74 (MIM#: 616562), while the phenotypic variability between the two groups of cases appears to represent a spectrum of disease rather than separate disease entities. Therefore, cases caused by inherited biallelic *BBS2* variants have been lumped into a single disease entity, referred to as *BBS2*-related ciliopathy.\n\nNine unique variants (two missense, three nonsense, one frameshift, and three splicing) that have been reported in thirteen probands in five publications (PMIDs: 11567139, 11285252, 24608809, 21052717, 33777945) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be biallelic loss-of-function. \n\nThis gene-disease association is also supported by data from ProteinAtlas that *BBS2* is non-specifically expressed in the retina as well as many other tissues, consistent with the clinical heterogeneity of Bardet-Biedl syndrome (PMID: 28940711). Biochemical evidence indicates that the protein encoded by the *BBS2* gene is a component of the BBSome, a protein complex that functions in ciliogenesis and intraflagellar transport (PMID: 22072986). Tandem affinity purification followed by mass spectrometry has shown that *BBS2* forms a stable complex along with other proteins that are encoded by genes associated with Bardet-Biedl syndrome (*BBS1*, *BBS4*, *BBS5*, *BBS7*, *BBS8*, and *BBS9*, PMID: 17574030). *BBS2* homozygous knockout zebrafish without a functional copy of *BBS2* exhibit retinal degeneration and vision loss (PMID: 33324636). A *Bbs2* null mouse model recapitulated even more of the features of human patients, including obesity, retinal degeneration, renal cysts, and male infertility (PMID: 15539463).\n\nIn summary, *BBS2* is definitively associated with autosomal recessive BBS2-related ciliopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Retina Gene Curation Expert Panel on March 7th, 2024 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/41ba6a14-fd97-4e1f-9ba4-587951e839fb","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/be74a060-cfb3-4180-a107-cfaf0e81bfa3","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/be74a060-cfb3-4180-a107-cfaf0e81bfa3_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10072","date":"2025-01-04T03:48:35.619Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/be74a060-cfb3-4180-a107-cfaf0e81bfa3_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10072","date":"2024-03-07T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["DiseaseNameUpdate"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/be74a060-cfb3-4180-a107-cfaf0e81bfa3_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/be74a060-cfb3-4180-a107-cfaf0e81bfa3_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cdbce7f6-4922-4c52-883c-89de43e170fa","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"- Gene is expressed in the retina, but because BBS is a clinically heterogeneous disease, BBS2  is also expressed widely across many tissues.
