{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/13b75512-acce-4cdc-b2af-75095ac7acdev2.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"PSEN1 was originally evaluated for DCM by the ClinGen DCM GCEP on September 25th, 2020. Evidence of the association of this gene with DCM was re-evaluated using SOP v10 on May 29th, 2025As a result, the classification did not change. A summary of the information contributing to the classification of this gene at the time of re-evaluation is summarized herein.\n\nPSEN1 was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) in 2006 (Li et al., 2006, PMID: 17186461). There is a lack of robust human genetic evidence demonstrating this gene-disease relationship in the literature at the time of curation. All of the variants reported as disease-causing have subsequently been found at a frequency higher than would be expected for a monogenic, pathogenic effect in population reference data sets. Therefore, there is no scorable human genetic evidence. This gene-disease assertion is supported by expression studies (Gianni et al., 2010, PMID: 2019488).\n\nIn summary, the evidence presented for this gene-disease relationship does not provide convincing human genetic evidence in support of or refuting the role of PSEN1 and DCM. The relationship of PSEN1 with DCM is unclear and therefore classified as disputed. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Dilated Cardiomyopathy Working Group on May 29th, 2025 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/13b75512-acce-4cdc-b2af-75095ac7acde","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d71e8591-dece-4855-ae6c-d43e20cbf836","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"NoKnownDiseaseRelationship","changes":[{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},{"id":"cg:sopChange"},{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d71e8591-dece-4855-ae6c-d43e20cbf836_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10035","date":"2025-05-30T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d71e8591-dece-4855-ae6c-d43e20cbf836_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10035","date":"2025-09-04T15:03:34.905Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"The DCM GCEP classified PSEN1 as disputed as there was no genetic evidence that could be scored.","curationReasons":["RecurationTiming"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d71e8591-dece-4855-ae6c-d43e20cbf836_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d71e8591-dece-4855-ae6c-d43e20cbf836_seg_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0b9f3bb7-5163-4337-9b1e-51c36f71dd18_proband_segregation","type":"FamilyCosegregation","dc:description":"< 4 segregations","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17186461","rdfs:label":"Family A","estimatedLodScore":0.6,"family":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0b9f3bb7-5163-4337-9b1e-51c36f71dd18","type":"Family","rdfs:label":"Family A","ethnicity":{"id":"cg:UnknownEthnicity"},"member":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0d921a6e-2ed0-4f80-b875-fd0a93aa3dc9","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17186461","rdfs:label":"II.4","ageType":"AgeAtDiagnosis","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":52,"allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4ab9f9c7-7503-442d-9e14-1e22c9142934","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000021.4(PSEN1):c.998A>G (p.Asp333Gly)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA258124"}},"ethnicity":{"id":"cg:UnknownEthnicity"},"firstTestingMethod":"Next generation sequencing panels","previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"LMNA, MYH7, TNNT2, SCN5A, CSRP3, PLN","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a7b14e17-2595-4686-a5d5-17c2ccec2b95_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17186461","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4ab9f9c7-7503-442d-9e14-1e22c9142934"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Heterozygous"}}}},"meetsInclusionCriteria":false,"phenotypePositiveAllelePositive":3,"proband":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0d921a6e-2ed0-4f80-b875-fd0a93aa3dc9"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValiditySegregationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a7b14e17-2595-4686-a5d5-17c2ccec2b95","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Allele frequency in African Ancestry in gnomAD v4 >0.01% and is not sufficiently rare to be causal for penetrant Mendelian disease.
