To date, at least 5 unique variants (4 missense, 1 synonymous) have been reported in 4 probands with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (Davis et al., 2001, PMID: 11733062; Wang et al., 2018, PMID: 29978770; Gonzalez-Garay et al., 2013, PMID:24082139; Burstein et al., 2021, PMID:32746448). However, these probands also carry additional variants in genes implicated in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, including MYH7 and MYBPC3. No segregation data is available. The mechanism for disease is unknown, but predicted to be gain of function (GOF) from functional assays performed by Davis et al., 2001. This gene-disease relationship is supported by expression studies showing restricted expression of MYLK2 in skeletal muscle and heart and biochemical functional studies. The original curation was performed by the Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Gene Curation Expert Panel (GCEP) and published on January 18, 2017. In summary, there is no scored genetic evidence, and no new convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. More evidence is needed to either support or entirely refute the role MYLK2 plays in this disease. This classification was re-evaluated and approved by the ClinGen Hereditary Cardiovascular Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on  February 8, 2023. As a result of this re-evaluation, the classification was changed from limited to disputed. \n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/87639cbf-9c37-4f3e-b5f5-ee66c48ca1ef","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6f0f41e3-7b5b-477c-b45d-598b5f8f3df0","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"NoKnownDiseaseRelationship","changes":[{"id":"cg:expertPanelChange"},{"id":"cg:classificationChange"},{"id":"cg:newEvidence"},{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},{"id":"cg:sopChange"},{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6f0f41e3-7b5b-477c-b45d-598b5f8f3df0_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10104","date":"2023-04-12T22:15:03.348Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6f0f41e3-7b5b-477c-b45d-598b5f8f3df0_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10104","date":"2023-02-08T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"There is currently no scoreable genetic evidence to support the pathogenic role of MYLK2 in autosomal dominant hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
