Seven probands with CNVs (4 duplications, 3 gross deletions) at the 22q11.2 location have been reported in 3 publications (PMID: 22318994, 28121514, 36205932). No evidence for a causal role for *CRKL* in congenital heart disease has been reported. Although this gene-disease association is supported by an animal model, no reports have directly implicated the gene in humans.
