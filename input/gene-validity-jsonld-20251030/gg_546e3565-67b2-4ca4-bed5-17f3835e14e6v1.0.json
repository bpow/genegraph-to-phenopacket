This condition is characterized by developmental delay, intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, hypotonia and seizures (PMIDs: 32666275, 37122292). Other reported features include endocrine abnormalities such as primary aldosteronism and congenital hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia, facial dysmorphisms, heart defects, and self-injurious behavior. *CACNA1D* has also been reported in relation to autosomal recessive sinoatrial node dysfunction and deafness; this disease has been curated separately.\n\nNine missense variants reported in 11 probands in ten publications (PMIDs: 22495309, 22542183, 23913001, 25533962, 28318089, 28472301, 28726809, 32583268, 36208199, 37122292) are included in this curation. Most of the reported variants are *de novo*. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is gain of function (PMIDs: 23913001, 37122292).\n \nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by the biochemical function of CACNA1D, as seven other genes encoding alpha subunits of voltage-gated calcium channels have also been implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders, including *CACNA1A, CACNA1B, CACNA1C, CACNA1E, CACNA1G, CACNA1H, and CACNA1I*.\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between CACNA1D and autosomal dominant complex neurodevelopmental disorder with or without aldosteronism. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel on September 4, 2024 (SOP Version 11).\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/546e3565-67b2-4ca4-bed5-17f3835e14e6","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9eb44537-f403-45ce-b89e-83363918f986","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9eb44537-f403-45ce-b89e-83363918f986_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2024-09-04T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9eb44537-f403-45ce-b89e-83363918f986_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2025-05-23T16:12:00.581Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9eb44537-f403-45ce-b89e-83363918f986_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9eb44537-f403-45ce-b89e-83363918f986_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3378cf25-fa1a-48b7-8071-f61297931086","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Score increased based on the number of genes encoding alpha subunits of voltage-gated calcium channels that are associated with NDDs.","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ec3645ae-00eb-497d-ba5a-e55bc593f035","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Seven other genes encoding alpha subunits of voltage-gated calcium channels haven also been implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders: CACNA1A, CACNA1B, CACNA1C, CACNA1E, CACNA1G, CACNA1H, and CACNA1I.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38785745","rdfs:label":"Alpha subunit gene family of voltage-gated calcium channels","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionA"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9eb44537-f403-45ce-b89e-83363918f986_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/162dca00-3c0f-453a-8d4d-d184a126eeb4","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/162dca00-3c0f-453a-8d4d-d184a126eeb4_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"This variant significantly enhanced current densities, shifted voltage dependence of activation and inactivation to more negative voltages and reduced channel inactivation in both Cav1.3 splice variants.
