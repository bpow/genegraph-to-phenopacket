This association was made using case-level and case-control data. Prothrombin G20210A is a 3'UTR variant in the F2 gene that causes a gain of function and increased prothrombin synthesis. Individuals carrying this variant are at an increased risk of developing thrombosis and thromboembolism. Other missense/regulatory region variants with similar gain of function impact are also reported. F2 was first associated with this disease in humans as early as 1996 (Poort et al., PMID: 8916933). Summary of Case Level Data (5.1 points): The association is seen in at least 7 probands in 7 publications (PMIDs: 8916933, 16988559, 27013614, 22716977, 23265743, 32194638, 11372696). Summary of Case-Control Data (9 points): Association between the prothrombin G20210A variant and thrombotic phenotype is seen in at least 4 case-control studies (PMID: 10027711, 29051591, 9669991, 8916933) at the single variant level. More case-control evidence is available in the literature. The mechanism for disease is gain of function, with the G20210A as well as other variants observed causing resistance to inactivation by antithrombin and therefore causing an increased risk of thrombosis. (PMID:  8916933, 11443298, 15059842). Summary of Experimental Data (1 point): This gene-disease relationship is supported by functional assay that shows upregulation of mRNA 3' end processing (PMID: 11443298, 15059842). In summary, the F2- Thrombophilia due to thrombin defect gene-disease relationship is Definitive. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hemostasis/Thrombosis GCEP on June 24, 2020 (SOP Version 6).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/df2179bd-bf53-4bb1-a84e-8dc19ffe4c32","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6389b3a3-ef86-4588-9be8-eb79dcb8d3cd","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6389b3a3-ef86-4588-9be8-eb79dcb8d3cd_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2020-06-24T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6389b3a3-ef86-4588-9be8-eb79dcb8d3cd_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2020-09-16T19:23:17.591Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6389b3a3-ef86-4588-9be8-eb79dcb8d3cd_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6389b3a3-ef86-4588-9be8-eb79dcb8d3cd_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d53f0533-d915-46b2-b866-7be0541509c5","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The experimental evidence suggests a mechanism for the gain-of-function prothrombin variant to result in increased risk for thrombotic events in individuals carrying the variant.

Immunoblot analysis also showed that the mutant construct expressed higher protein levels, that were quantitatively reflective of the increased mRNA accumulation (as opposed to enhanced translatability of mRNA), than the normal construct. The experimental system thus represented F2 expression in humans. \n\nPrimer extension analysis to specifically detect nuclear pre-mRNA and cytoplasmic mRNA was performed to evaluate transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. Results showed that the pre-mRNA levels were equal, but there was a 1.5-fold higher expression of F2*A mRNA, compared to F2*G mRNA, suggesting that the upregulation is post-transcriptional. \n\nThe authors evaluated three possible alterations in the 3' end processing of the mutated pre-mRNA: (1) the F2*A and F2*G ppoly(A) tails were identical in length and therefore cannot explain higher expression of F2*A mRNA. (2) The sequence of the poly(A) signal and the number of 3' uridines affect the cleavage efficiency for cleavage between the poly(A) and 3' uridines by the 3' end processing machinery. RT-PCR showed that in the majority of both mRNAs, cleavage follows the A or G of CA or CG dinucleotides, respectively, suggesting that the processing was similar. (3) Ribonuclease protection assay to identify quantitative differences of correctly processed mRNA revealed that more 3' extended mRNA was observed with normal F2*G than with mutant F2*A construct. An in-vivo competition assay with a set of constructs with tandem 3' end formation signals demonstrated a 3:1 preference of the 5' site over the 3' site. A comparison of the 3' F2*G and the 3' F2*A signals directly shows the increased efficiency of the F2*A signal in 3' end formation.\n\nThus, the authors conclude that the gain-of-function variant causes upregulation of 3' end processing resulting in greater abundance of mRNA that is available for protein synthesis.

The variant was absent in an asymptomatic family member, 100 Japanese controls and in 5 persons with undiagnosed thrombosis.\n\nRecombinant prothrombins (proband's plasma was unusable due to Warfarin treatment) were converted to thrombins using bovine factors Xa  and Va and incubated with human antithrombin. The authors suggest that the mutant thrombin had a lower catalytic activity for fibrinogen than the wild-type due to structural disruption by the Leu-596 substitution. \nThrombin–antithrombin complex formation by the mutant prothrombin was almost negligible for the first 30 minutes when measured by ELIZA, while it increased in a time-dependent manner in the wild-type. This result suggested that the variant resulted in a dysprothrombin that was highly resistant to inhibition by antithrombin. \n\nThrombin generation assay to evaluate the effect of the mutation on thrombin generation in plasma revealed that the homozygous mutant plasma showed decreased maximum concentration of thrombin. Heterozygous mutant plasma (mimicking proband's plasma) showed intermediate values. The thrombin activity derived from the mutant prothrombin was found to be lower than that derived from the wild-type prothrombin, but its inactivation was exceedingly slow, resulting in a prolonged procoagulant state in the proband's plasma. \n\nExpression studies in HEK293 cells from PMID: 28961453 show that relative residual  thrombin activity was 90.9% due to this variant compared to 5.1% in wild-type.

In carriers of the prothrombin G20210A variant, additional presence of this allele did not increase risk of VTE; however, it led to a 2-fold increase in individuals with FV Leiden and A19911G variants. These case-control cohorts were evaluated separately. Previous studies on the A19911G variant have been contradictory, however. PMID: 11434686 reports that the A19911G variant increased risk of venous thrombosis in carriers of G20210A, when present in trans. Their sample size was very small (18 cases and 4 controls). PMID: 12139755 reports that the A19911G variant did not increase the risk of DVT independently, but modified risk (slightly increased) when present along with G20210A. The authors show that the 19911A allele was in complete linkage disequilibrium with the 20210A allele. PMID: 14504098 performed functional analysis on the A19911G  variant and showed via mini-gene assay that there was 31% higher splicing efficiency resulting from the mutant 19911G allele. The variant results in the formation of a pentamer motif (CAGGG) including a GGG triplet, which could potentially function as an intronic splicing enhancer. The variant allele, G19911A is present in gnomAD at a frequency of 0.5316 (8167/15362 alleles) with 2160 homozygotes in the non-Finnish European population. Based on all the evidence above, the impact of this variant is not clear and no individual patients with thrombophilia due thrombin defect have been reported in the literature with this variant alone. It may be a risk/modifier allele. Therefore, the variant is not scored any points.","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7c8a2762-1dea-4918-a3fa-520842cec916_cc_evidence_item","type":"Finding","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16981886","rdfs:label":"Martinelli_case-control study","caseCohort":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f0102318-84ff-4ec1-b674-9f441d8fc80a","type":"Cohort","allGenotypedSequenced":428,"alleleFrequency":0.5280373831775701,"detectionMethod":"The 19911A>G variant (c.1726-59G>A) was screened for using PCR-RFLP","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7c8a2762-1dea-4918-a3fa-520842cec916_cc_evidence_item"}],"numWithVariant":226,"relatedCondition":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f0924b58-9762-463c-9565-60798557e35e"}},"controlCohort":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b8e88ad4-ca70-406d-a501-3f79842eba79","type":"Cohort","allGenotypedSequenced":402,"alleleFrequency":0.4751243781094527,"detectionMethod":"The 19911A>G variant (c.1726-59G>A) was screened for using PCR-RFLP","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7c8a2762-1dea-4918-a3fa-520842cec916_cc_evidence_item"}],"numWithVariant":191},"lowerConfidenceLimit":1.1,"method":{"id":"cg:SingleVariantAnalysis"},"statisticalSignificanceType":"","statisticalSignificanceValue":1.5,"statisticalSignificanceValueType":"Odds Ratio","upperConfidenceLimit":2.1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCaseControlSingleVariantAnalysisCriteria","strengthScore":0},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3a82766c-496e-4e94-869d-24125ad15d2a","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The estimated risk of having a venous thrombosis when carrying the prothrombin 20210G>A variant was analyzed in a logistic model that adjusted for age, sex, presence of arterial thrombotic episodes, and factor V Leiden mutation.
