Variants in KCNJ2 are associated with Andersen-Tawil syndrome (ATS), a condition associated with dysmorphic features, periodic paralysis and prominent U waves on ECG. It has been classified as a definitive gene for ATS by the LQTS Gene Curation Expert Panel. As the ECG abnormalities in patients with KCNJ2 variants can be interpreted as prolonged QT intervals, it was also curated for isolated LQTS and found to have limited evidence. KCNJ2 variants have also been implicated in CPVT (referred to as CPVT3 in early reports). However, as in the case with isolated LQTS, it is unclear if these reports actually represent atypical presentations of ATS without extra-cardiac features. A number of reports describe patients with KCNJ2 variants presenting with CPVT-like arrhythmogenic symptoms and without any extra-cardiac features (Tester et al, 2006, PMID:16818210; Kimura et al, 2012, PMID:22589293; Kalscheur et al, 2014, PMID:24561538), supported by functional studies demonstrating effects of the variants on IK1 current in cellular assays (Vega et al, 2009, PMID:19843922; Kimura et al, 2012, PMID:22589293; Kalscheur et al, 2014, PMID:24561538). As a consequence, KCNJ2 scored with limited evidence for involvement in CPVT based on these reports. However, none of these patients presented unequivocally with a classical CPVT phenotype and demonstrated features such as subtle ECG U wave abnormalities and bidirectional VT at rest which may be suggestive of atypical and cardiac-specific ATS rather than a true CPVT diagnosis. The expert panel therefore agreed to classify KCNJ2 as Disputed for CPVT. As patients with pathogenic KCNJ2 variants may present with a phenotype that can resemble typical features of CPVT, it may be beneficial to include this gene in extended arrhythmia genetic testing panels for patients with a CPVT-like phenotype if no causative variants are found when sequencing validated CPVT genes. However, any detected variants should be interpreted in the context of the known genotype-phenotype relationships for KCNJ2, in particular by investigating for subtle phenotypic features associated with ATS. Note: All CPVT genes were curated by 3 separate blinded teams. The evidence and scores reached by these 3 teams was reviewed by the CPVT Gene Curation Expert Panel (GCEP). The classification and summary presented here is the conclusion of this GCEP's analysis according to evidence teams' efforts. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia Gene Curation Expert Panel on 20th January, 2021 (SOP Version 7).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c979a458-e488-46cc-bcbf-2ce9db3dc126","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b5f2490f-215e-427e-be7b-6a68e3f89e32","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b5f2490f-215e-427e-be7b-6a68e3f89e32_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10074","date":"2021-01-20T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b5f2490f-215e-427e-be7b-6a68e3f89e32_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10074","date":"2021-04-22T18:55:58.074Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"None of the reported patients presented unequivocally with a classical CPVT phenotype and demonstrated features such as subtle ECG U wave abnormalities and bidirectional VT at rest which may be suggestive of atypical and cardiac-specific ATS rather than a true CPVT diagnosis.
