KCNJ10 was first associated with this disease in humans as early as 2009 (Yang et al.​). A heterozygous missense variant has been reported in two probands, who also carry a heterozygous likely pathogenic/pathogenic variant in SLC26A4. No segregation information is available. This gene-disease association claim is supported by functional studies, which are not convincing enough to confirm a digenic inheritance (15320950, 17959752, 19426954). In summary, there is convincing evidence disputing the association between KCNJ10 and enlarged vestibular aqueducts, and digenic inheritance with SLC26A4. More evidence is needed to either support or refute the role KCNJ10 plays in this disease. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hearing Loss Working Group on 2/20/18.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c322f14d-307d-4c85-aa6f-6dc77f20be1f","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/09f81c95-1213-4029-a6bd-279e52f240c7","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"NoKnownDiseaseRelationship","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/09f81c95-1213-4029-a6bd-279e52f240c7_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/09f81c95-1213-4029-a6bd-279e52f240c7_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2018-02-20T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"Disputing the digenic inheritance claim.","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/09f81c95-1213-4029-a6bd-279e52f240c7_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/09f81c95-1213-4029-a6bd-279e52f240c7_ad_other_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6002b326-9d5f-428b-b4cf-9541db40e655_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Proband carries an SLC26A4 variant that is classified as Likely Pathogenic by four clinical testing labs in ClinVar.
