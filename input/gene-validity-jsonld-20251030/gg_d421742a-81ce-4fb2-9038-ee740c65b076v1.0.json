It was first reported clinically in two siblings with adult-onset CVID4 and a homozygous deletion in TNFRSF13C (Warnatz, K., 2009). TNFRSF13C encodes tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 13C, which is a B-cell receptor specific for TNFSF13B. It is important for B cell survival. At least three unique variants in TNFRSF13C have been described since 2009 to confer CVID4; these variants are two missense (c.475C>T and c.62C>G) and one deletion (c.265_288del). Robust experimental data, including one particularly convincing paper (Thompson et al, 2001) which reports on expression, protein interaction, and model systems data, support the importance of BAFF-R in vitro and in vivo for immune system health. Additional experimental data regarding the function of TNFRSF13C in B cell survival (Kayagaki et al., 2002) and further mouse models (Saski et al., 2004 and Shul-ga-Morskaya et al., 2004) were also included. The maximum score was reached for experimental data. However, case data is less convincing and there are only a few cases to date of clinical autosomal recessive CVID4 by pathogenic variants in TNFRSF13C. There is one particular variant (c. 62c>G; p.Pro21Arg) that has been recurrently identified, including in one study (unpublished by Mouillot G et al.) where 485 patients with hypogammaglobulinemia were sequenced for mutations in TNFRSF13C. Seventy patients were found to have at least one mutation in TNFRSF13C, composed of 6 that were P21R homozygous, and 7 were compound heterozygotes with one variant being P21R. This variant is sometimes referred to as a “risk factor” and not described as causing sever disease, which was further iterated when Speletas M et al (unpublished) reported that P21R homozygosity results in mild immunodeficiency. However, Kutukculer et al identified an individual with compound heterozygous variants P21R and c.475C>T (which also has conflicting reports of pathogenicity) who had a severe presentation of CVID4. In summary, only the case of the homozygous c.265_288del variant is considered informative at this time, as such there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d421742a-81ce-4fb2-9038-ee740c65b076","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1408411b-9d28-4308-b2bc-dbada3660898","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1408411b-9d28-4308-b2bc-dbada3660898_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10080","date":"2021-04-13T00:33:59.028Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1408411b-9d28-4308-b2bc-dbada3660898_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10080","date":"2021-04-23T11:26:13.754Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"In order for a gene-disease association to reach a Moderate classification at least 3 unrelated probands harboring variants with sufficient supporting evidence for disease causality must be reported.

However, additional CVID individuals with this variant have been reported (Losi 2005, Lougaris 2016, Pieper 2014, van Schowenburg 2015) and in vitro functional studies showed that the Pro21Arg variant caused impaired ligand-independent preassembly of BAFF-R proteins, resulting in reduced binding of BAFF ligand, decreased NF-kappaB activation in B cells, and decreased proliferation and IgM production by B cells (Pieper 2014; PMID: 24406071). Based on the available evidence, the Pro21Arg variant may contribute to CVID as a risk factor, possibly together with other genetic and/or environmental factors.","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Inconclusive","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5dbd1ca9-d2e6-48c1-a81b-97b726b80f25","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22699762","rdfs:label":"Mouillot 1","detectionMethod":"Direct sequencing of the coding region of TNFRSF13C.
