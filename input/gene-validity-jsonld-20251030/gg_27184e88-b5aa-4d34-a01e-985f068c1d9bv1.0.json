CD79B encodes the Ig-beta protein of the B-cell antigen receptor. Agammaglobulinemia is characterized by absence of circulating B cells and low or absent serum immunoglobulin levels (PMID: 18978465). CD79B was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Agammaglobulinemia 6 in 2007 (Dobbs et al, PMID: 17675462; Ferrari et al, PMID: 17709424). Variants reported in this gene thus far include missense and nonsense variants. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. \n   \nSummary of Case Level Data (6.25 points):\nThere have been 3 patients from 3 publications and 1 unpublished proband, till date, reported with homozygous variants in CD79B (PMID: 17675462; 17709424, 24722855). The mechanism of disease is expected to be biallelic loss of function. \n\nSummary of experimental data (6 points):\nThis gene-disease association is supported by in-vitro functional assays and animal models. Igβ is expressed on B cells (PMID: 10383452), and together with Igα, it forms a hetetrodimer on the surface of B cells. The Igα/Igβ  complex is involved in signal transduction that induces B-cell differentiation (PMID: 9354476). B cells lacking Igβ are arrested in the proB cell stage of development (PMID: 12165571). A targeted knock-out mouse model (PMID: 8602530) and a naturally occurring mouse model with a spontaneous nonsense mutation (PMID: 19727123) have been reported, which recapitulate the arrest of B-cell development at the early pre-B cell stage, as noted in patient cells.  \n  \nIn summary, the evidence to support the gene-disease relationship of CD79B and Agammaglobulinemia 6 is moderate. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/27184e88-b5aa-4d34-a01e-985f068c1d9b","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9c252b2c-2183-4e7d-8ceb-69f7a01cc1d9","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9c252b2c-2183-4e7d-8ceb-69f7a01cc1d9_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10080","date":"2021-01-26T17:10:06.440Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9c252b2c-2183-4e7d-8ceb-69f7a01cc1d9_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10080","date":"2021-01-26T17:10:52.423Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"The total genetic evidence points for this curation is 6.25, including an unpublished proband with agammaglobulinemia and no B cells, with the homozygous missense variant, Arg95Cys (NM_000626.2:c.283C>T; CA400604758), heterozygous parents, and complete penetrance, scored at 0.25 points.
