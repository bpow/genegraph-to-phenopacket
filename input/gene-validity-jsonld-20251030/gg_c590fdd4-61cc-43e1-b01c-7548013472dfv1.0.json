RIN2 encodes RAS and RAB interactor 2 and biallelic mutations in this gene are reported to cause cell trafficking dysfunction. Individuals with RIN2 syndrome have varying clinical features including macrocephaly, coarsening of facial features, down-slanting palpebral fissures, full everted lips, soft redundant skin, gum hypertrophy, irregular dentition, sparse scalp hair, joint hypermobility, and scoliosis. Four frameshift variants that have been reported in four probands in four publications (PMIDs: 19631308, 20424861, 24449201, 30769224) are included in this curation. In all cases, the variants presented in homozygosity. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss of function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by expression studies that show this gene is expressed in fibroblasts, a relevant tissue, and studies showing that the expression level of the gene was markedly decreased when analyzed by qRT-PCR and absent when analyzed by immunoblotting (PMID: 19631308). In summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between RIN2 and autosomal recessive RIN2 syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Lysosomal Diseases GCEP on December 4, 2023 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c590fdd4-61cc-43e1-b01c-7548013472df","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7427a25e-68a1-4e1b-b951-f1a1d7b1e52b","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7427a25e-68a1-4e1b-b951-f1a1d7b1e52b_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10110","date":"2023-12-05T20:16:11.771Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7427a25e-68a1-4e1b-b951-f1a1d7b1e52b_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10110","date":"2023-12-04T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7427a25e-68a1-4e1b-b951-f1a1d7b1e52b_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7427a25e-68a1-4e1b-b951-f1a1d7b1e52b_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b5d2f6b7-300d-4d55-a0dc-daeffa686d6f","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"This group typically does not award points for tissue specific expression.
