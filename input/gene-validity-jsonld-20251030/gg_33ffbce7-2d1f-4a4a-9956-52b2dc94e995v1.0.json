This association was made using case-level and experimental data. More than a 100 variants in this gene are reported in humans, ranging from deletions, duplications, nonsense, frameshift, missense and splicing variants. Congenital Factor X deficiency is characterized by a bleeding diathesis, diagnosed by a prolonged aPTT and PT and reduced Factor X activity levels. Mutations in F10 were first associated with this disease in humans as early as 1989 by Reddy et al. (PMID: 2790181).\n\nSummary of Case Level Data (12 points): The association is seen in at least 14 probands in 7 publications (PMID: 30036279, 1985698, 10746568, 30507709, 2790181, 1939653, 22931370). More case-level evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts) has been reached.\n\nThe mechanism for disease have been reported to be biallelic loss of function, although a number of individuals with heterozygous variants showing mild to moderate FX deficiency are reported in the literature (PMID: 10746568). Some of these occurrences are noted in the genetic evidence, but not scored. \n\nSummary of Experimental Data (4.5 points): FX activates prothrombin to thrombin in the blood coagulation pathway (PMID: 3286010). Mouse models that have the F10 gene knocked out show embryonic and perinatal lethality (PMID: 27626380, 10739370, 18036190); however, the mouse model with a missense variant, FX Friuli recapitulates FX deficiency in humans. The evidence from the mouse models parallel that seen in humans, where a complete loss of FX activity has not been reported in any patients.   \n\nIn summary, the F10-Congenital FX deficiency gene-disease relationship is definitive. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hemostasis/Thrombosis GCEP on Nov 27, 2019.

The proband is scored reduced points as NMD is not predicted.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5a34274d-e5e4-4834-ba2f-f3c1995e2989","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10746568","rdfs:label":"Millar_Proband_G-1","ageType":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/","ageUnit":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/","detectionMethod":"Southern blotting was performed followed by PCR to amplify all the 8 exons, splice junctions, and a 461-bp promoter fragment of the F10 gene and the amplified fragments were sequenced.","firstTestingMethod":"Genotyping","phenotypeFreeText":"Moderate presentation; had experienced significant haemorrhagic symptoms","phenotypes":"obo:HP_0008321","previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"FX:C < 1%, FX:Ag = 2%","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d4a8ca9c-7b55-4b47-b441-4e802a7d5a9f_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10746568","allele":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e3814fc4-4ee4-4712-abd1-27173aed8e91","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NC_000013.11:g.113149062G>A","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA256478666"}},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ac19fa2e-4e64-4c5a-9add-2158a3c0c331","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NC_000013.11:g.113149201_113149217del","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA612868319"}}]}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":199,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria6","strengthScore":16.5,"subject":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/k03HDZmSBpQ","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0009212","gene":"hgnc:3528","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","websiteLegacyID":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/assertion_4adcc848-b354-4975-801f-4b55bbca64ad-","@context":{"@vocab":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"},"curationReasons":{"@type":"@vocab","@container":"@set"},"GCISnapshot":{"@type":"@id"},"dc:isVersionOf":{"@type":"@id"},"websiteLegacyID":{"@type":"@id"}}}
