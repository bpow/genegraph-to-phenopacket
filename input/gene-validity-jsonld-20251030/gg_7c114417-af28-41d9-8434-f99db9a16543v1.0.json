This association was made using case-level data only. At least 5​ variants shown to cause a skipping of exon 8 have been reported in humans. DFNA5​ was first associated with this disease in humans as early as 1998​ (Van Laer et al.​). Association is seen in at least 7 probands in 6​ publications (9771715, 14676472, ​14559215, 24933359, 17868390, 24506266). Variants in this gene\nsegregated with disease in 155 additional family members. The mechanism for disease is a heterozygous gain of function, as evidenced by several cell culture model systems (Gregan 2003, Van Laer 2004, Op de Beeck 2011, Van Rossom 2012), that results in an increase in apoptosis. In summary, DFNA5​ is definitively associated with autosomal dominant nonsyndromic hearing loss. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hearing Loss Working Group on 11/21/2017.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7c114417-af28-41d9-8434-f99db9a16543","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9b0a844b-f968-48e0-8940-35584eb3454b","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9b0a844b-f968-48e0-8940-35584eb3454b_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9b0a844b-f968-48e0-8940-35584eb3454b_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2017-11-21T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9b0a844b-f968-48e0-8940-35584eb3454b_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9b0a844b-f968-48e0-8940-35584eb3454b_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b47b7133-c274-4d23-a350-5fbb136ffed2","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"More evidence available, Models & Rescue score maxed out.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9dde3fb1-b8b9-4d80-8d60-1dd215853de7","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Mutant DFNA5 caused increase in reactive oxygen species and other signs of programmed cell death.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22848872","rdfs:label":"Van Rossom Model","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/90bd9096-42e8-442e-bc70-40d417e1dea7","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Awarded 0.25 points (not supported by GCI).
