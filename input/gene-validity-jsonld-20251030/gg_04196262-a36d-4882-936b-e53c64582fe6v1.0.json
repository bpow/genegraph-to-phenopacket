CD3ε deficiency results in an absence of mature TCR αβ and γδ T cells in the periphery whereas natural killer and B lymphocytes were normally detected, causing T−, B+, NK+ SCID. At least 8 variants predicted to cause a loss of function of the protein have been reported, suggesting biallelic loss of function is the molecular mechanism. Evidence supporting the gene-disease relationship includes the identification of at least 8 probands with CD3E variants who have been reported in at least 8 publications (PMID: 8490660, 28916186, 15546002, 27807805, 28597365, 24515816, 31589898, 32016651). This gene-disease relationship is also supported by animal models (PMIDs: 9843989, 9885898, 7588594), rescue experiments (PMID: 9843989), and expression studies (PMIDs: 3012357, 2410254). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence has been reached. In summary, CD3E is definitively associated with autosomal recessive immunodeficiency 18. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen SCID/CID Working Group on 01/21/2021.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/04196262-a36d-4882-936b-e53c64582fe6","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/29d6bb32-65b3-4c78-9c94-da71cc591565","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/29d6bb32-65b3-4c78-9c94-da71cc591565_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10081","date":"2021-01-26T17:29:08.775Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/29d6bb32-65b3-4c78-9c94-da71cc591565_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10081","date":"2021-01-26T17:29:55.008Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/29d6bb32-65b3-4c78-9c94-da71cc591565_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/286cbb10-a420-4ddf-b614-2ae0676c1401_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The homozygous (by consanguinity) c.173del variant causes the frameshift Leu58HisfsTer9, resulting in a premature stop codon in exon 6 of 9 which is predicted to cause NMD.
