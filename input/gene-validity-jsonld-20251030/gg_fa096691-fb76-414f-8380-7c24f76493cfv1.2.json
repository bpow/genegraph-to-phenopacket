Clinical features include aniridia or iris hypoplasia, hypotonia, non-progressive cerebellar ataxia, cerebellar atrophy, and variable intellectual disability. Affected individuals are usually diagnosed within the first year of life. The syndrome is caused by heterozygous dominant-negative missense variants or biallelic truncating variants in *ITPR1*. Based on the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting guidance, there are differences in inheritance pattern and molecular mechanism and therefore, the autosomal dominant and recessive forms of Gillespie syndrome were assessed separately. This curation concerns autosomal recessive Gillespie syndrome. Variants in *ITPR1* have also been implicated in two types of autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA), in which iris development is normal: infantile-onset SCA29 and adult-onset SCA15. The relationship between *ITPR1* and spinocerebellar ataxia will be curated separately.\n\nSix homozygous or compound heterozygous truncating variants (nonsense, frameshift, and splice) that have been reported in five probands in three publications (PMIDs: 27108797, 29169895, 29663667) are included in this curation. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be partial loss of function. The recessive alleles are predicted to generate premature termination codons that appear to act as partial rather than full loss-of-function variants, possibly via exon skipping mechanisms (PMID: 27108797). *ITPR1* haploinsufficiency causes adult-onset SCA15; because carrier parents of individuals with recessive Gillespie syndrome are unaffected, there is no apparent haploinsufficient effect associated with these hypomorphic alleles. A single homozygous missense variant, located in the C-terminal channel domain, has been reported in a girl with features of Gillespie syndrome (PMID: 35574166); in the absence of functional evidence of pathogenicity, the significance of this variant is unclear.\n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by mouse models partially recapitulating the human phenotype (PMIDs: 8538767, 34338282).\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *ITPR1* and autosomal recessive Gillespie syndrome. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel on January 23, 2025 (SOP Version 11).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fa096691-fb76-414f-8380-7c24f76493cf","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e43bc1b6-656e-4f8e-aeed-5c39fac10624","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":[{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"},{"id":"cg:sopChange"},{"id":"cg:newEvidence"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e43bc1b6-656e-4f8e-aeed-5c39fac10624_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2025-04-15T20:03:10.930Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e43bc1b6-656e-4f8e-aeed-5c39fac10624_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2025-01-23T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e43bc1b6-656e-4f8e-aeed-5c39fac10624_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e43bc1b6-656e-4f8e-aeed-5c39fac10624_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/da8626e0-0ba5-4406-a069-51f047c0da1c","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The ataxia and aniridia observed in these KO mice resemble the phenotype in affected individuals, but the early death doesn’t.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/eba526b3-e148-4e71-a594-ce760d824e2d","type":"Finding","dc:description":"The authors identified an ocular-specific Itpr1 transcript consisting of only 218 amino acid residues and comprising the last 6 exons of Itpr1, where the mutations detected in patients with Gillespie syndrome cluster.
