The pathogenicity of this variant was supported by functional studies in a cell culture model system that showed mutant receptors have significant reduction in fractional Ca2+ release and increase in termination threshold (Tang et al, PMID: 22374134) and significant destabilization of the SPRY domain of RyR2 that may lead to protein misfolding and LOF phenotypes (Lau et al, PMID: 25370123). Three unique variants in 3 individual probands were also reported in 2015 (Xu et al, PMID: 26573135) and one unique variant in 1 proband in 2019 (Alvarado et al, PMID: 30835254). The mechanism for disease is unknown. This gene-disease relationship is supported by expression studies (Martin et al, 1998, PMID: 9607712; Helms et al, 2016 PMID: 27688314), interaction with cardiac myosin-binding protein-C (MYBPC3) (Stanczyk et al, 2018, PMID: 29930088), and in knock-in and rescue mice models (Alvarado et al, PMID: 30835254; Kohno et al, 2020, PMID: 33244105). In summary, at least 8 unique variants have been reported in humans and there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Gene Curation Expert Panel in January 2017. It was reevaluated in July 2020 and again in December 2022. As a result of the most recent reevaluation, the classification did not change.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c7fd3299-5bd9-4ffb-b091-f967b97537fc","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3ac9dd09-674f-4d67-94da-234ffb4e5070","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","changes":[{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"},{"id":"cg:expertPanelChange"},{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},{"id":"cg:newEvidence"},{"id":"cg:sopChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3ac9dd09-674f-4d67-94da-234ffb4e5070_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10104","date":"2022-12-14T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3ac9dd09-674f-4d67-94da-234ffb4e5070_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10104","date":"2023-10-11T15:20:27.660Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["RecurationTiming"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3ac9dd09-674f-4d67-94da-234ffb4e5070_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3ac9dd09-674f-4d67-94da-234ffb4e5070_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5ad4468e-26b7-4044-b24d-0592f5bc1af7","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e3caf345-7ce3-4628-a7fd-46a5a7d22eab","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Surgical myectomy samples, interventricular septum - Total RyR2 abundance measured by Western blot (control, n=6; sarcomere-mutation hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [HCM], n=16; sarcomere-negative HCM, n=7).

Heterozygous mice exhibited a small but significant decrease in cross-sectional area of septal and left ventricular cardiomyocytes. The above results suggest that an impaired CaM regulation of RyR2 leads to severe left ventricular hypertrophy. Quantitative RT-PCR showed that the mRNA levels of β-myosin heavy chain (β-MHC), atrial natriuretic peptide, and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) were upregulated in left ventricle of 7- and 10-day homozygous hearts. Interventricular septum thickness was decreased in homozygous hearts, whereas left ventricular posterior wall thickness of homozygous hearts did not substantially differ from that of WT hearts (Table ​(Table1).1).
