Variants in EBP have been reported in patients with X-linked dominant chondrodysplasia punctata 2 and X-linked recessive MEND syndrome (male EBP disorder with neurologic defects). X-linked chondrodysplasia punctata 2 (also known as Conradi-Hunermann-Happle syndrome) primarily affects females and is lethal *in utero* in males, although a few affected males with 47,XXY karyotype or somatic mosaicism have been reported. It is associated with a significant deficiency of EBP function. Non-mosaic hypomorphic missense variants in males cause MEND syndrome, comprising neurologic and structural malformations without chondrodysplasia punctata. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, these disorders are curated separately due to differences in inheritance pattern, molecular mechanism and phenotypic variability. This curation focuses on MEND syndrome.\n    \n*EBP* was first reported in relation to MEND syndrome in 2003 (Milunsky *et al.*, PMID: 12503101). Affected males are hemizygous for a non-mosaic hypomorphic EBP allele resulting in a defect in sterol biosynthesis but retaining some residual enzyme activity. The clinical features are highly variable, and include intellectual disability, facial dysmorphisms, digital abnormalities, cataracts, dermatologic abnormalities, structural brain abnormalities, other congenital abnormalities, and early death in a subset of individuals. Individuals with MEND syndrome also have increased plasma concentration of 8(9)-cholestenol and 8-dehydrocholesterol. Carrier females typically do not have clinical manifestations of the disorder but may show biochemical abnormalities.\n\nMissense variants in this gene have been reported in 7 unrelated male probands with MEND syndrome in 6 publications (PMIDs: 12503101, 20949533, 23852825, 24459067, 24700572, 27276700), including 3 multigenerational pedigrees with multiple affected males. The mechanism of disease is partial loss of function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by protein interaction with WLS (PMID: 28734904), recently involved in syndromic intellectual disability.\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between EBP and MEND syndrome. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel on September 7, 2022 (SOP Version 9).\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/98711190-78c5-4e49-9762-bef7fb55fc3d","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/21e97c32-52ae-4331-8788-64d652f20af3","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/21e97c32-52ae-4331-8788-64d652f20af3_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2023-03-08T16:16:24.737Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/21e97c32-52ae-4331-8788-64d652f20af3_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2022-09-07T18:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/21e97c32-52ae-4331-8788-64d652f20af3_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/21e97c32-52ae-4331-8788-64d652f20af3_seg_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2a3410b8-7867-48d9-922e-d70b7a0b4912_proband_segregation","type":"FamilyCosegregation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24700572","rdfs:label":"1","estimatedLodScore":2.41,"family":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2a3410b8-7867-48d9-922e-d70b7a0b4912","type":"Family","rdfs:label":"1","member":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4a5f0139-4fb0-406c-9eea-ee680ec2159a","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24700572","rdfs:label":"IV-5","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":42,"allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a5100f82-53fe-4a4d-8a37-988519ee2d2f","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_006579.3(EBP):c.224T>A (p.Ile75Asn)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA204966"}},"detectionMethod":"X-chromosome Exome + Sanger\n","firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"maps to Xp11.4-p11.21 PubMed: 23307567","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1435c726-3c8c-427e-be4f-e71209b3f89e_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24700572","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a5100f82-53fe-4a4d-8a37-988519ee2d2f"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:AlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Hemizygous"}}}},"meetsInclusionCriteria":true,"phenotypeFreeText":"specific digital abnormalities including postaxial polydactyly, cutaneous syndactyly, and brachydactyly.
