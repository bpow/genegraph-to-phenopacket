The AIFM1 gene encodes apoptosis-inducing factor, mitochondria-associated, 1 which is an FAD-dependent oxidoreductase with important roles in oxidative phosphorylation, apoptosis, and redox control. \n\nThe AIFM1 gene was first reported in relation to X-linked Leigh syndrome spectrum in 2010 (PMID: 20362274). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included four unique variants identified in four cases from four publications (PMIDs: 20362274, 22019070, 25934856, 28299359). No segregation data were available. AIFM1 variants have also been reported to be associated with X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease-4 (CMTX-4, also known as Cowchock syndrome). Loss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease association is also supported by expression, functional alteration in patient cells, functional alteration in non-patient cells, and animal models (PMIDs: 18791645, 20362274, 15526035, 29780003, 29531799, 18309327).\n\nIn summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on August 17, 2020 (SOP Version 7).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a90fff88-2d82-44bb-9919-4c9a14f1e0d0","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e917f93b-01ef-42e3-bf8d-b50a91f83f9c","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e917f93b-01ef-42e3-bf8d-b50a91f83f9c_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2021-06-14T13:57:32.582Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e917f93b-01ef-42e3-bf8d-b50a91f83f9c_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2021-06-14T13:57:41.937Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e917f93b-01ef-42e3-bf8d-b50a91f83f9c_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e917f93b-01ef-42e3-bf8d-b50a91f83f9c_ad_dn_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1faea1cb-7bfc-4b8f-884a-32afbb8cf40d_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"de novo missense variant without evidence of the impact of the variant on gene function.
