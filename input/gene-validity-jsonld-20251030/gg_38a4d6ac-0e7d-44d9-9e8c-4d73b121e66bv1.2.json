(PMID: 15162322) who reported loss-of-function variants in two multigenerational families with several affected males and one male proband with non-syndromic intellectual disability. At least 9 variants have been reported, including 5 splice-site, 2 nonsense, 1 frameshift, and 1 missense variant with altered protein function (PMIDs: 15162322, 15342698, 18081026, 26310293,  31170314, 31981491, 36720500). Of note, missense variants without functional characterization were of unclear pathogenicity and were not scored (PMIDs: 25644381, 28330790). Segregation evidence is available from three families with more than three affected members each (PMIDs: 15162322, 15342698). Affected males exhibit mild to moderate intellectual disability and behavior problems, including autism spectrum disorder in some; at least two individuals had seizures or abnormal EEG. Carrier females are unaffected.\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence, including biochemical function (PMID: 304115557), functional alteration in patient cells (PMID: 26310293), and mouse models (PMIDs: 30557699, 33771871).  \nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *FTSJ1* and X-linked complex neurodevelopmental disorder. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel on February 1, 2023 (SOP Version 9). This gene-disease pair was originally evaluated on January 17, 2018 and classified as moderate. Curation of additional genetic and experimental evidence resulted in the classification being updated.\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/38a4d6ac-0e7d-44d9-9e8c-4d73b121e66b","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1bc0312a-eb44-4d79-8816-d9ef685e2c8c","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1bc0312a-eb44-4d79-8816-d9ef685e2c8c_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2023-02-01T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1bc0312a-eb44-4d79-8816-d9ef685e2c8c_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2023-03-01T21:19:21.333Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1bc0312a-eb44-4d79-8816-d9ef685e2c8c_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1bc0312a-eb44-4d79-8816-d9ef685e2c8c_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/01c6c2a9-3a5f-4be2-a0e0-76884b029b93","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/efdb1f22-d6f8-4597-a39e-e4b30d6c0a03","type":"Finding","dc:description":"FTSJ1 encodes an RNA methyl transferase, like other genes involved in ID:\nNSUN2, Intellectual developmental disorder, autosomal recessive 5\nMETTL5, Intellectual developmental disorder, autosomal recessive 72\nTRMT1, Intellectual developmental disorder, autosomal recessive 68\nTRMT10A, Microcephaly, short stature, and impaired glucose metabolism (AR)\nWDR4,  Microcephaly, growth deficiency, seizures, and brain malformations (AR); Galloway-Mowat syndrome 6 (AR)\n","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30415557","rdfs:label":"RNA methyl transferase","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionA"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1bc0312a-eb44-4d79-8816-d9ef685e2c8c_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/28502dc8-6318-4bcc-bae9-7b6431a5e04c","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ee3e0779-2619-481a-8ae9-364d9c298d46","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"tRNAPhe from two genetically independent cell lines of NSXLID patients with loss-of-function FTSJ1 mutations nearly completely lacks Cm32 and Gm34, and has reduced peroxywybutosine (o2yW37).
