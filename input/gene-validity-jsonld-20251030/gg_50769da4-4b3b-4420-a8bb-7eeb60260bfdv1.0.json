IFN-γ stimulation leads to STAT1 phosphorylation, inducing its homodimerization to form γ-activating factor (GAF), which is translocated to the nucleus, and binds to γ-activating sequences to induce transcription of target genes (PMID: 35456913).\n\nMSMD is a primary immunodeficiency disease characterized by predisposition to clinical disease caused by weakly virulent mycobacteria such as non-tuberculous mycobacteria, Bacillus Calmette Guerin (BCG) and environmental mycobacteria, caused by a single gene mutation (PMID: 25453225). Genetic etiologies of MSMD are involved in the production or response to interferon-γ (IFN-γ).\n\n6 missense variants that have been reported in 7 probands in 4 publications are included in this curation (PMIDs: 11452125, 16934001, 22573496, 36339330). Functional experiments demonstrated  impaired phosphorylation, nuclear accumulation and GAF DNA binding activity of the mutant STAT1. Variants reported showed  a dominant-negative effect on the gamma interferon activated sequence (GAS) activation, but not on the interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE) activation (PMID: 22573496).\n\nExperimental evidence also supports this gene-disease relationship. Expression of STAT1 is widely enhanced in EBV transformed lymphocytes (PMID: 23715323). Defective GAF response which results in impaired mycobacterial immunity could be demonstrated in a mouse fibroblast cell line. Mutant cells showed defective STAT1 phosphorylation and nuclear accumulation upon stimulation by IFN-γ (PMID: 11452125). \n\nIn summary, *STAT1* is definitively associated with Mendelian Susciptibility to Mycobacterial Disease (MSMD). This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. \n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/50769da4-4b3b-4420-a8bb-7eeb60260bfd","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ac2fe8ac-e470-4fa3-b596-ad8e15d5b065","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ac2fe8ac-e470-4fa3-b596-ad8e15d5b065_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10145","date":"2024-12-06T14:45:13.063Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ac2fe8ac-e470-4fa3-b596-ad8e15d5b065_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10145","date":"2024-11-20T10:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ac2fe8ac-e470-4fa3-b596-ad8e15d5b065_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/763c5523-fe7d-4a0a-85c7-3597797399d4","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The variant Leu706Ser has functional data which support it results in loss of function with impaired tyrosine 701 phosphorylation and diminished activation  of GAF in response to both IFN-γ and IFN-α to 25%. \n\n","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/763c5523-fe7d-4a0a-85c7-3597797399d4_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"Subcellular distribution of STAT-1 in simian virus 40 (SV40)–transformed fibroblasts (SV40 fibroblasts) by immunofluorescence showed a smaller proportion of  STAT-1 in the nucleus of the mutant cells upon IFN-γ stimulation than in control cells.
