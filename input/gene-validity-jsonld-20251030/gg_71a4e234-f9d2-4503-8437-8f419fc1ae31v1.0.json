{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/71a4e234-f9d2-4503-8437-8f419fc1ae31v1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"The *MED27* gene is located on chromosome 9 at 9q34.13 and encodes a subunit of the Mediator multiprotein complex, which is involved in transcriptional regulation (PMID 9989412). *MED27* was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive neurodevelopmental disorder with spasticity, cataracts, and cerebellar hypoplasia in 2021 (Meng et al., PMID: 33443317). Sixteen variants (11 missense, 1 in-frame indel, 3 frameshift and 1 splicing) that have been reported in 30 probands in two publications (PMIDs: 33443317, 37517035) are included in this curation. Variants in this gene segregated with disease in families with multiple affected family members. The mechanism of pathogenicity is reported to be loss of function (PMID: 16582438). ​\n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence (biochemical, protein interactions and animal models) (PMIDs: 9989412, 37516429, 16582438, 36305825, 30091705, 31613003). Other genes that code for mediator complex subunits (*MED12*, *MED13*, *MED13L*, *MED17*, *MED25* and *CDK8*) are definitively or strongly associated with conditions involving developmental, language and motor delay, intellectual disability, seizures, cataracts and microcephaly. A knockout zebrafish model showed a reduction in head size and abnormal neurological development (PMID 16582438). Early lethality was observed in *MED27* gene knockouts in mouse, fruit fly and chicken (PMIDs: 36305825, 30091705, 31613003). While these latter three models do not necessarily recapitulate the disease phenotype, the observation that no reported human cases have been homozygous or compound heterozygous for loss-of-function variants suggests that complete loss of function of MED27 may be embryonically lethal. \n\nIn summary, there is strong evidence to support the relationship between *MED27* and autosomal recessive neurodevelopmental disorder with spasticity, cataracts, and cerebellar hypoplasia. Three years must elapse from the first proposal of the assertion to reach a definitive classification without any valid contradictory evidence. We will re-evaluate this gene-disease relationship at that time to determine if an upgraded classification of definitive is warranted. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Syndromic Disorders GCEP on the meeting date 12/15/2023 (SOP Version 10).
