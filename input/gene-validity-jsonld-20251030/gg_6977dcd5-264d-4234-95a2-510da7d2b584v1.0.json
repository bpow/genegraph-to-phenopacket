{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6977dcd5-264d-4234-95a2-510da7d2b584v1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"The relationship between FBXL4 and Leigh syndrome spectrum was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of April 20, 2020. The FBXL4 gene encodes F-box and leucine-rich repeat protein 4, which localizes to the mitochondria via a mitochondrial targeting sequence. While the exact role of this gene is still under investigation, it has been shown to function in mitochondrial bioenergetics and dynamics, as well as mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) maintenance.\n\nThe FBXL4 gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Leigh syndrome spectrum in 2013 (PMIDs: 23993194, 23993193). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data. This curation included nine unique variants identified in seven cases from four publications (PMIDs: 25868664, 23993194, 31969900, 23993193). Segregation data includes 4 affected individuals and 5 unaffected individuals in two kindreds (PMID: 23993194). Loss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease association is also supported by biochemical function, expression, functional alterations in patient cells, and rescue in patient cells (PMIDs: 27977873, 25613900, 23993193, 23993194, 31969900). \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support this gene-disease relationship, including that more than three years have elapsed from the first proposal of the association. This classification was approved by the NICHD U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on April 20, 2020 (SOP Version 7).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6977dcd5-264d-4234-95a2-510da7d2b584","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fed67104-182c-48f2-85c0-ecb05cd6dd72","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fed67104-182c-48f2-85c0-ecb05cd6dd72_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2020-11-23T19:31:17.246Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fed67104-182c-48f2-85c0-ecb05cd6dd72_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2020-11-23T19:31:46.846Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fed67104-182c-48f2-85c0-ecb05cd6dd72_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/48c7b115-2bab-4e62-a0aa-ca2d375aa9a0_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"CH for predicted null & missense; evidence for reduced expression in patient cells","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/724a2484-23a5-4172-9695-2d5bc0f36ace","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23993194","rdfs:label":"subject 5 - family 3, individual II:1","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":1,"detectionMethod":"trio WES","firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"birth weight <10th percentile, birth weight <3rd percentile, birth HC <10th percentile, last measured weight 42nd  percentile, last measured height 19th percentile, last measured HC 26th percentile, developmental delay, non-verbal, dysmorphic facies, small feet, lactic acidemia, high plasma alanine, high C3-carnitine, cerebral atrophy, basal ganglia abnormalities, leukodystrophy, delayed myelination, thin corpus callosum, ataxia, hypotonia, limb hypertonia, autonomic dysfunction, seizures, choreoathetosis, bursts of symmetrical limb flailing, swallowing dysfunction, respiratory distress with colds, dysmotility, GERD, high transaminases, renal tubular acidosis, neutropenia, progressive scoliosis, severe sleep dysfunction, scattered mitochondrial enlargement on muscle histology, normal muscle histochemistry, reduced RC activity in muscle biopsy, particularly complex III (14%), complex I-III (9%), and complex II-III (21%).

Stably transduced patient cells showed a robust expression of wildtype FBXL4 (wt-FBXL4) at transcript and protein levels (Figures 2A, B). The quantification of FBXL4 transcripts by qRT-PCR revealed decreased steady-state levels of FBXL4 mRNA in S1 and S2 by approximately 80% when compared with an age matched control cell line, C1. These levels were increased significantly in the over-expressing cell lines (Figure 2A). The WB immunodetection assay failed to detect the FBXL4 protein in the total protein lysate of non-transduced cells (Figure 2B). Delivery of the wt-FBXL4 gene increased significantly the amount of mtDNA in both patient cell lines (Figure 2C). As a result, the mtDNA copy number deficiency in S1 cells was corrected (compared to C), whereas in S2 cells the mtDNA levels increased up to 200% of the levels of controls. In both S1 and S2 cells over-expressing wt-FBXL4, the steady state levels of respiratory complex subunits were fully rescued (Figure 1D), the CIV specific activity was increased to control values (Figure 2D), and the CS activity and lastly the mitochondrial ATP levels were also increased significantly (Figures 2E, F). Genetically complemented S1 cells recovered partially the tubular appearance of the mitochondrial network observed in C1 but interestingly, genetically complemented S2 cells maintained a fragmented mitochondrial network (Fig. 3).","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31969900","rdfs:label":"Emperador rescue patient cells","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:PhenotypeRescue"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellRescueCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":3},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fed67104-182c-48f2-85c0-ecb05cd6dd72_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4a9bb254-7286-4f45-8267-9922b1fbb4f4","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction in patient cells.","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6f94d2bc-4d56-428d-a130-35de6b262040","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Muscle homogenates or isolated mitochondria from subjects with FBXL4 mutations showed variably decreased activity of MRC complexes (Table S5).

In cultured skin fibroblasts, milder mtDNA depletion was detected in S1 (38%) whereas normal levels of mtDNA were observed in S2 (Figure 1B). The levels of five mitochondrial transcripts (transcripts of MT-ND1 and MT-ND6 subunits from CI; MT-CYB subunit from CIII, MT-CO1 subunit from CIV and MT-ATP6 subunit from CV) were consistently reduced in S1 and S2 compared with control fibroblasts (Figure 1C). Notably, S2, with normal mtDNA copy number, showed the highest reduction of the five transcripts measured. The steady-state levels of subunits from respiratory chain complexes were also found decreased in fibroblasts from S1, and, to a greater extent, in fibroblasts from S2 (Figure 1D). The levels of the nDNA-encoded ATP5A subunit from CV, however, remained unchanged in S1, or were mildly decreased in S2, excluding a global problem in the mitochondrial protein content. The expression of two subunits (SDHA and SDHB) of the nuclear encoded complex II, the citrate synthase (CS) of the TCA cycle, and the translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane (TOMM20) were partially decreased in S2 (Figure 1D). Fully assembled CIV levels were clearly lower in patient fibroblasts relative to controls (Figure 1E). Enzymatic measurements provided evidenced of a severe CIV dysfunction (Figure 1F). Noteworthy, the CS activity in fibroblasts from S1 and S2 was also significantly diminished (Figure 1F). Assessment of mitochondrial content by staining with the cationic lipophilic dye MitoTracker Green showed a small but significant increase in mitochondrial content (15–20%) in S1 and complemented S1 cell lines compared to control (C1), and a remarkable increase (250% of C1) was detected in S2 fibroblasts and in the S2 cell line overexpressing wt-FBXL4.
