The study reported 4 families with anterior segment dysgenesis/Peters anomaly/aniridia and identifed four variants that were predicted to be disease causing. However, the variants are not supported by functional evidence, and they are found at relatively high population frequencies in gnomAD. \n\nThere are no additional case reports; however, several studies refer to *FOXD3* in relation to aniridia based on the first report by Kloss et al (PMID: 22815627).  \n\n*FOXD3* is shown to be expressed in the periocular mesenchyme (PMID: 32528955). The function of **FOXD3** is not clearly understood, but animal studies suggest a role in neural crest specification, migration and survival (PMID: 16499899). Zebrafish studies show that **foxd3**-positive cell population that migrates into the anterior segment in the late embryonic and early larval stages (PMID: 33182738). *Foxd3* knock out in mice result in embryonic lethality (PMID: 12381664).  \n\nIn summary, the evidence supporting the relationship between **FOXD3** and autosomal dominant aniridia has been disputed and no valid evidence remains to support the claim. More evidence is needed to either support or entirely refute the role **FOXD3** plays in aniridia.
