Both heterozygous and homozygous affected individuals were identified in the consanguineous family, with homozygous individuals having an earlier onset of auditory neuropathy. This gene-disease association is supported by two transgenic mouse lines and relevant expression and functional alteration studies (20624953, 23441200). In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease association. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease association. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hearing Loss Working Group on 2/6/2020.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/74d830f5-c614-43c4-b9d3-f0217b3ce766","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fc54aaf6-8e1b-4c98-bcbe-e1f337f6eadc","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fc54aaf6-8e1b-4c98-bcbe-e1f337f6eadc_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fc54aaf6-8e1b-4c98-bcbe-e1f337f6eadc_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2020-02-06T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fc54aaf6-8e1b-4c98-bcbe-e1f337f6eadc_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fc54aaf6-8e1b-4c98-bcbe-e1f337f6eadc_ad_other_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c2c8ebda-182d-448c-9da9-fd6969dcc228_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Functional assays showed variant caused overexpression.

Two mouse lines were successful, and each had a progressive hearing loss with onset at either 4-8 or 16 weeks of age. By 24 weeks HL had progressed to severe at 12 and 24 kHz. Hearing was determined to be caused by inner, and not outer hair cell dysfunction, consistent with auditory neuropathy. This was based on preserved otoacoustic emissions even after progression to severe HL, indicative of preserved OHCs, and a decrease in IHC ribbons over time in Diap3-overexpressing mice. Comparison of morphological features of whole mount stereocilia showed sparseness and variable length in transgenic mice compared to WT.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23441200","rdfs:label":"Animal Model 2","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a46b3a8a-a096-422f-aef3-f4fdc9c987e1","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Points downgraded to 0.5 because Drosophila only have one diaphanous gene, while humans have multiple, therefore this model serves as a homolog for both DIAPH3 and DIAPH1, another human hearing loss gene","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/daa276dc-268a-4621-9144-67775bea0186","type":"Finding","dc:description":"decreased response to sound","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20624953","rdfs:label":"Animal Model","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fc54aaf6-8e1b-4c98-bcbe-e1f337f6eadc_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/13c636e5-e2c3-478e-8fbf-a0e283ab263b","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/15b56ee6-2a6b-4d95-a932-a5155d01b169","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"DIAPH3 expression was significantly higher in homozygotes and heterozygotes compared to controls.
