Two de novo truncation variants that have been reported in 2 probands in 1 publications (PMID: 28592524) are included in this curation. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss-of-function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence (fly and mouse expression-level data; and fly and mouse models) (PMIDs: 23255421, 20941780, 23328398, 25691540, 16360689, 18663139, 23825967, 21385766, 28592524). The mouse models have somewhat variable phenotypes but generally indicate increased rates of ventricular septal defects and outflow tract anomalies in *Robo1* null mice. In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Congenital Heart Disease GCEP on the meeting date 9/3/2024 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3a7c41db-3157-4557-b988-91a6f71aab03","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ef3f81f4-4b3b-40ee-af2c-8235e92e7cfb","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ef3f81f4-4b3b-40ee-af2c-8235e92e7cfb_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10130","date":"2024-11-26T01:14:12.306Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ef3f81f4-4b3b-40ee-af2c-8235e92e7cfb_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10130","date":"2024-09-03T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ef3f81f4-4b3b-40ee-af2c-8235e92e7cfb_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ef3f81f4-4b3b-40ee-af2c-8235e92e7cfb_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/81277a52-288a-4602-9b39-2719f1b4255c","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Decreased as is null model in context of autosomal dominant mechanism curation; also for variability in cardiac phenotype across mouse models.
