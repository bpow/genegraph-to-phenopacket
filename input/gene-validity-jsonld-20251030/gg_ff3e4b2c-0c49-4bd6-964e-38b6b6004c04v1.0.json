Biallelic and monoallelic variants in *MUTYH* were linked to multiple types of cancer and/or tumor, including hereditary breast cancer, familial ovarian cancer, familial adenomatous polyposis and colorectal cancer. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we have split these associations into different curations due to phenotypic differences and/or inheritance mechanism. Therefore, this curation solely focuses on autosomal recessive familial ovarian cancer. \n\n**Summary of Case-Control Data: 0 point:**\nThis gene-disease relationship has been studied in at least 3 case-control or cohort studies at the aggregate variant level. Two cohort studies suggested an increased risk for ovarian cancer in biallelic *MUTYH* variant carriers compared to controls (PMID: 19732775, 27194394). However, the cohort population in these two studies may include the probands with colorectal cancer and polyposis in addition to ovarian cancer; therefore, the association of *MUTYH* and autosomal recessive ovarian cancer cannot be specified. Another case-control study suggested no increased risk for ovarian cancer in biallelic *MUTYH* variant carriers (PMID: 35172496).   \n\n**Overall Summary:**\nIn summary, given that case-control studies show inconclusive results or no increased risk for ovarian cancer in biallelic *MUTYH* variant carriers, and no experimental data support this gene-disease relationship, the Hereditary Cancer GCEP has disputed this gene-disease association. More evidence is needed to either support or entirely refute the role *MUTYH* plays in autosomal recessive ovarian cancer. \n\nThis gene-disease pair was originally evaluated as limited by the Breast/Ovarian Cancer GCEP on 11/29/2017. This re-curation was approved by the ClinGen Hereditary Diseases GCEP on 06/23/2023 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ff3e4b2c-0c49-4bd6-964e-38b6b6004c04","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2842036e-4a06-4d05-bce0-846f0f3c1678","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"NoKnownDiseaseRelationship","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2842036e-4a06-4d05-bce0-846f0f3c1678_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10023","date":"2023-12-20T18:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2842036e-4a06-4d05-bce0-846f0f3c1678_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10023","date":"2023-12-21T01:53:00.900Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"Given that case-control studies show inconclusive results or no increased risk for ovarian cancer in biallelic MUTYH variant carriers, and no experimental data support this gene-disease relationship, the Hereditary Cancer GCEP has disputed this gene-disease association.","curationReasons":["RecurationNewEvidence","RecurationFrameworkChange"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2842036e-4a06-4d05-bce0-846f0f3c1678_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2842036e-4a06-4d05-bce0-846f0f3c1678_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2842036e-4a06-4d05-bce0-846f0f3c1678_cc_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a81b4703-f2b2-4d48-aaa2-c9cc17658f1c","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The cohort population used in this study included individuals that were diagnosed with polyposis.
