{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4c349b56-8cb1-43dc-b7a9-bc15cbf6adb0v1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"The relationship between *NDUFA2* and primary mitochondrial disease was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of August 7, 2023. The *NDUFA2* gene encodes the NADH dehydrogenase 1 alpha subcomplex subunit 2 protein, which is an accessory subunit of mitochondrial complex I. Defects of this protein lead to complex I deficiency.  \n\n*NDUFA2* was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive primary mitochondrial disease in 2008 (PMID: 18513682). While various names could be given to the constellation of features seen in those with *NDUFA2*-related disorders, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *NDUFA2* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework. Of note, *NDUFA2* was first curated by this GCEP for its association with Leigh syndrome spectrum (LSS) on March 13, 2019 (SOP v6), with a final classification of Moderate. This current curation for the association with primary mitochondrial disease includes cases with LSS.\n\nEvidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation includes four variants in four probands across four publications (PMIDs: 18513682; 27159321; 28857146; 32154054). Affected individuals had a fairly consistent phenotype with early childhood onset and including Leigh syndrome spectrum, global developmental delay and/or regression, spasticity, upper motor neuron signs, microcephaly, seizures, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and failure to thrive; with brain imaging findings including cerebral atrophy, hypoplasia of the corpus callosum, and demyelination. Lab abnormalities include lactic acidemia, hypoketotic hypoglycemia, and/or hyperammonemia. Complex I deficiency was noted in muscle and/or fibroblasts. \n\nLoss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by known biochemical function, functional alteration in patient cells, a cell culture model, and transgenic rescue in model systems (PMID: 18513682; 22822087; 27626371; 33340416).  \n\nIn summary, there is moderate evidence to support the relationship between *NDUFA2* and autosomal recessive primary mitochondrial disease. However, given the consistent clinical and biochemical phenotype seen in the four reported cases, this Expert Panel elected to upgrade the classification to Definitive. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on August 7, 2023 (SOP Version 9).
