SASH3 protein is phosphorylated at Ser27 following T- or B-cell receptor ligation and protein kinase C (PKC) activation. The phenotype associated with combined immunodeficiency due to *SASH3* variants is characterized by recurrent infections and multilineage immunodeficiency.\n\n*SASH3* was first reported in relation to combined immunodeficiency X- linked in 2021 (Delmonte et al., PMID: 33876203). The study reported four unrelated male patients carrying three hemizygous LOF variants in the *SASH3* gene. Patients manifested in early childhood with recurrent sinopulmonary, cutaneous, and mucosal infections, and refractory autoimmune cytopenias. Horrillo et al., 2022 reported a man with a milder form of combined immunodeficiency and a novel truncating *SASH3* variant which led to a complete absence of the protein (PMID: 35464398). The reported patients exhibited CD4+ T-cell lymphopenia, defective T cell activation and proliferation, and B cell lymphopenia. Mother heterozygosity was confirmed in three of the five patients reported.\n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by rescue, animal model and expression evidence. Correction of the proliferative defect of SASH3−/− Jurkat cells occurred upon transduction with the SASH3 LV vector. Transduction efficiency was also evident by reconstitution of PLCγ1 phosphorylation in SASH3-transduced Patient T cells upon in vitro stimulation with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 (PMID: 33876203). Two different Sly1 deficient mice models recapitulated the human phenotype (PMIDs: 16227612 and 19604361). Both Sly1Δ/Δ and Sly1-/-  showed that absence of SLY1  protein affects CD4 T cell development, T-cell proliferation, and cytokine production and impairs antibody response to T- dependent and T- independent antigens. Preferential SASH3 expression in lymph nodes and thymus gland indicates an essential role in the development and activation of lymphocytes (PMIDs: 24309898 and 25970244). \n\nIn summary, *SASH3* is definitively associated with combined immunodeficiency X-linked. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both research and diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time.\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/96f9ee9e-7d9e-42ef-97b3-da96b9c217fd","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7f112c27-e610-425d-bbc5-a6d1d0de4da1","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":[{"id":"cg:classificationChange"},{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},{"id":"cg:sopChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7f112c27-e610-425d-bbc5-a6d1d0de4da1_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10080","date":"2024-12-20T18:31:58.431Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7f112c27-e610-425d-bbc5-a6d1d0de4da1_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10080","date":"2024-12-20T10:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["RecurationTiming"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7f112c27-e610-425d-bbc5-a6d1d0de4da1_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7f112c27-e610-425d-bbc5-a6d1d0de4da1_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a3e810fa-db76-40ef-8fb5-dc13bf70bb05","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fea0b3e3-72dd-4096-8286-49c7bb784d39","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Quantitative transcriptomics analysis (RNA-Seq) combined with analysis with antibody-based profiling detected preferential expression in lymph nodes and thymus gland.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24309898","rdfs:label":"Analysis of the human tissue-specific expression","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7f112c27-e610-425d-bbc5-a6d1d0de4da1_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2d7a5638-d0ef-43db-8e5e-3c1d5b05ec4d","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6b0843a7-38e1-41e3-be7b-be87a20768a7","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"western blotting on T-cell lysates from two patients carrying SASH3 mutations (P1 and P2)  in resting conditions and upon stimulation with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 revealed decreased levels of pZAP70, pLAT, and pPLCγ1, virtual absence of pERK and pAKT, and markedly reduced amounts of p4EBP and pS6.
