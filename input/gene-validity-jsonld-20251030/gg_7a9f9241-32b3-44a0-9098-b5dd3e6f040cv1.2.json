At least 50 variants have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 17​ probands in ​8​​ publications (​PMID27387980, 24664454,21211974,21279644,14520662,27519903,15322983,30794915). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 37​​ additional family members. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism for disease is dominant negative (Sjoberg et al.,PMID10545598). Of note, this gene has also been implicated in cardiomyopathy without myopathy.These ​have been​​ assessed separately by Cardiomyopathy Expert Panel. This gene-disease association is supported by ​animal models, expression studies, ​​in vitro​​ functional assays. In summary, ​MYH7​​ is definitively associated with Autosomal dominant myopathy​​. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference for Laing distal myopathy, myosin storage myopathy and scapuloperoneal syndrome and other MYH7 related myopathies (ex. PMID23478172, PMID29624713) in molecular mechanism AND inheritance pattern AND phenotypic variability. Therefore, all of the disease entities have been lumped into one disease entity, ​MYH7-related skeletal myopathy.
