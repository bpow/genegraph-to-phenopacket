{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0d879f3a-d78f-4116-a928-ee06371590cdv3.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"PRDM16 was originally evaluated for AD dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) by the ClinGen GCEP on 10/25/2019. Evidence of the association of this gene with DCM was re-evaluated using SOP v10 on 05/30/2025. Since the time of the pervious curation, extensive new evidence has been published and as a result, the classification changed from Limited to Strong Evidence. A summary of the information contributing to the classification of this gene at the time of re-evaluation is summarized herein. \n\nHuman genetic evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data. At least 12 loss of function variants (including missense, nonsense, and large deletions) have been reported in humans with DCM. Previous genetic evidence was reviewed using scoring guidance in accordance with SOP v10. The Arnt et. al study, which included analysis of 131 heart biopsies from cases of DCM with or without features of non-compaction, was not scored during this curation due to a limited gene list that did not evaluate other high evidence DCM genes as well as current population frequencies of the identified variants (Arnt et. al, 2013, PMID: 337685516). Additionally, a previously evaluated study from Long et. al reported a 4 month old DCM patient carrying a de novo predicted truncating variant c.1047dupC (p.S350fsX), which was supported by experimental data remained scored from the original curation (PMID: Long et. al, 2017, PMID: 29267541). New genetic evidence included cases from Sun et. al (2023) and Billon et. al (2025). Sun et al report a case of a 3 month boy diagnosed with DCM. Whole exome sequencing revealed a de novo truncating variant c.559C>T (p.Gln187X), which was supported by additional experimental expression evidence (Sun et. al, 2023, PMID: 38113297). Billon et al performed comprehensive cardiovascular multi-gene next generation sequencing on a cohort of 4900 index cases of DCM and/or hypertrabeculation features. 5 scoreable truncating variants were identified in DCM patients, including one de novo variant (Billon et. al, 2025, PMID: 40935858). \n\nIn addition, this gene-disease assertion is supported by additional experimental evidence including expression, functional, and animal model experiments. Cardiac localization studies have long demonstrated that PRDM16 is expressed in left ventricular (LV) myocardium in human and mouse hearts (Arndt et. al, 2013, PMID: 237685516). iPSCs derived from a proband carrying PRDM16-Q187X showed abnormal organization of the sarcomere proteins, as well as increased apoptosis and elevated markers of cardiac remodeling when compared to control cells (Sun et. al, 2023, PMID: 38113297). Additionally, several animal models were evaluated and determined to provide further support of this gene-disease assertion. PRDM16 knockdown zebrafish and transgenic zebrafish for a c.2104A>T (p.Lys702X) variant demonstrated bradycardia and significantly reduced cardiac output, which was restored in morphant embryos with increased doses of wild-type human PRDM16 (Ardnt et. al, 2013, PMID: 237685516). PRDM16 conditional knockout mice were shown to have significant decrease in ejection fraction (EF) and increase in LV size (Kramer et. al, 2023, PMID: 37395136). Three cardiomyocyte specific mouse models demonstrated signs of DCM including dilated LV and reduced EF (Wu et. al, 2022 PMID: 34915728; Cibi et. al, 2020, PMID: 33086060; Van Wauwe, 2024, PMID: 39304345). Finally, one heterozygous knock in mouse model of a c.888-3C>A splice acceptor variant showed cardiac hypoplasia and reduced systolic dysfunction (Kühnisch et. al, 2023, PMID: 37842925). \n\nIn summary, with new evidence over time, PRDM16 is now strongly associated with AD DCM. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the experimental and clinical settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Dilated Cardiomyopathy Working Group on 05/30/2025 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0d879f3a-d78f-4116-a928-ee06371590cd","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c0a3445a-5bb0-4d77-a4f0-5b7cfceb837f","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Strong","changes":[{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},{"id":"cg:classificationChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c0a3445a-5bb0-4d77-a4f0-5b7cfceb837f_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10035","date":"2025-10-16T18:02:08.880Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c0a3445a-5bb0-4d77-a4f0-5b7cfceb837f_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10035","date":"2025-05-30T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["RecurationNewEvidence","RecurationTiming"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c0a3445a-5bb0-4d77-a4f0-5b7cfceb837f_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3467519d-0cd9-4956-8ecb-8cfb4e10714a","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Variant not scored, incomplete sequencing w/ only PCR and sanger sequencing of PRDM16.
