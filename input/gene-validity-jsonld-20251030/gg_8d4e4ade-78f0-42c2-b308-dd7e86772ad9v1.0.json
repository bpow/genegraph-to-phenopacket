Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found difference in molecular mechanism, inheritance pattern and phenotypic variability. Therefore, the following disease entities have been split into multiple disease entities, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 1 (OMIM: 105400), schizophrenia (OMIM: 181500) and bipolar disorder (OMIM: 612371). The split curation for autosomal dominant ALS has been curated separately. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss of function. Four missense variants that have been reported in six probands in 4 publications (PMIDs: 20368421, 20538972, 29895397, 33414559) are included in this curation. This gene-disease association is also supported by animal models and functional alterations in primary rat motor neurons and non-patient cells (PMIDs: 20368421, 22203986, 29194436). Mouse animal models which express pathogenic and naturally inactivating DAO mutations recapitulate the ALS phenotype by displaying motor neuron loss and neuronal ubiquitin-positive aggregates. Furthermore, non-patient NSC-34 cells express higher amounts of apoptotic markers when co-cultured with glioma C6 cells expressing R199W. This is mediated by D-serine as confirmed by reduced levels of early and late apoptotic markers when NMDARs in NSC-34 cells are blocked with a D-serine/glycine binding site antagonist. In summary, DAO has limited association with autosomal dominant ALS. This classification was approved by the ClinGen ALS GCEP on March 8, 2022 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8d4e4ade-78f0-42c2-b308-dd7e86772ad9","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/35ac00ac-3279-4c7e-89b6-8a75e3cae414","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/35ac00ac-3279-4c7e-89b6-8a75e3cae414_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10096","date":"2022-04-12T18:40:30.580Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/35ac00ac-3279-4c7e-89b6-8a75e3cae414_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10096","date":"2022-04-12T10:38:08.867Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"Four mutations presented in the genetic evidence section did not meet the minor allele frequency cut-off of below 0.000005. The remaining mutation, R199W, was identified from candidate gene screening of a 14.52cM region where 148 genes were also found, although the majority of these genes were not screened and therefore the segregation  is likely to be the consequence of a linkage peak rather than a causative DAO variant. When consulting the experimental evidence, many of the model systems used homozygous DAO mutations instead of heterozygous mutations (the human DAO phenotype), and the R199W mutation (which does not have strong enough genetic evidence to be associated with ALS) to characterise physiological events, therefore the true phenotype was not recapitulated.

To investigate whether D-serine contributed to the effect of R199W DAO in coculture, NSC-34 cells that express NMDA receptors when differentiated were pretreated with DCKA, an antagonist at the glycine/D-serine binding site of NMDARs. NSC-34 cells were clearly sensitive to DCKA, as demonstrated by a decrease in early and late apoptotic markers. Therefore, expression of glial R199W DAO is sufficient to induce apoptosis in cocultured motor neurons and the effect appeasr to be mediated by D-serin.
