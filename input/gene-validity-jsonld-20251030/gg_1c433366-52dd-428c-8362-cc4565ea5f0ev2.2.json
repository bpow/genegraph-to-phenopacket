At least 100 unique variants (e.g. missense, in-frame indel, nonsense, frameshift, etc.) have been reported in humans according to ClinVar and HGMD with various historical diagnoses such as Muscle-Eye-Brain Disease, Walker-Warburg Syndrome, and LGMDR9 (LGMD2I). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data.\n\nVariants in this gene have been reported in at least 14 probands in 3 publications (PMIDs: 11592034, 11741828, 15121789). Many more probands are reported in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts) has been reached. Variants are associated with a variety of phenotypes including both congenital muscle-eye-brain or WWS or later-onset LGMD based on the residual α-Dystroglycan glycosylation activity, with higher activity correlating to a less severe presentation. The mechanism for disease is biallelic loss of function, with variants causing reduced glycosylation activity and a resulting lack of functional α-Dystroglycan. As this is an essential component in the complex responsible for stabilizing skeletal or cardiac muscle, as well as brain/eye functionality, the resulting disruption causes the presenting phenotypes such as muscle weakness, cardiac and respiratory involvement, and brain/eye abnormalities.\n\nThis gene-disease association is supported by many years of experimental evidence. This includes its well-known function in the O-mannosylation of α-Dystroglycan, as well as the formation of a complex with other proteins implicated in muscular dystrophy dystroglycanopathy such as FKTN and TMEM5 and the oligomerization/activity of *FKRP* mutants being significantly less than the WT protein. There are several well-supported mouse models as well, with knock-in models of both L276I and P448L showing dystrophic features (PMIDs: 20675713, 26574668).\n\nIn summary,*FKRP* is definitively associated with myopathy caused by variation in *FKRP*. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1c433366-52dd-428c-8362-cc4565ea5f0e","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6cb46400-ca4b-48cd-aaf7-dd493f0d2971","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":{"id":"cg:expertPanelChange"},"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6cb46400-ca4b-48cd-aaf7-dd493f0d2971_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10151","date":"2024-08-13T14:16:48.977Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6cb46400-ca4b-48cd-aaf7-dd493f0d2971_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10151","date":"2024-08-13T19:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["ErrorClarification"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6cb46400-ca4b-48cd-aaf7-dd493f0d2971_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6cb46400-ca4b-48cd-aaf7-dd493f0d2971_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/128251c1-83d4-4881-b828-cc2a5099dc98","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"FKRP colocalizes in a complex with two other proteins responsible for glycosylation, FKTN and TMEM5 (RXYLT1).
