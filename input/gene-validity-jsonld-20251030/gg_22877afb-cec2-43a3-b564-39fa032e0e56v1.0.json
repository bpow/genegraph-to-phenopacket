At least 9 unique variants (missense, nonsense and small deletions) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 9 probands in 7 publications (PMIDs: 25930971, 27711071, 29989513, 29652076, 26041762, 27193218, 30125339). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 3 additional family members. More evidence of additional individuals with these 9 variants are available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. This gene-disease association is supported by the biochemical function of ASCT1, an L-serine transporter (PMID: 15099708) expressed in the brain (PMID: 12533615), as well as its functional alteration and phenotypic recapitulation in a knockout mouse model (PMID: 30185558). L-serine is a non-essential amino acid in extra-neural tissues; however, its de novo synthesis within the brain is essential because of the limited permeability of the blood–brain barrier for L-serine. Within the brain, its synthesis is confined to astrocytes, and its shuttle to neuronal cells is performed by a dedicated neutral amino acid transporter, ASCT1 (encoded by SLC1A4). SLC1A4 disruption impairs brain development and function by decreasing its export from astrocytes. In summary, SLC1A4 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive spastic tetraplegia-thin corpus callosum-progressive postnatal microcephaly syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/22877afb-cec2-43a3-b564-39fa032e0e56","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8cff4bb6-caab-4696-a061-1f9a40c56c80","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8cff4bb6-caab-4696-a061-1f9a40c56c80_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10011","date":"2021-05-14T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8cff4bb6-caab-4696-a061-1f9a40c56c80_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10011","date":"2021-06-29T14:56:34.057Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8cff4bb6-caab-4696-a061-1f9a40c56c80_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8cff4bb6-caab-4696-a061-1f9a40c56c80_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8e1549b0-ad25-4a6c-b840-6a442c5e3c0e","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Findings of lower striatal and hippocampal volumes in ASCT1-KO mice associated with changes in the expression of neurodevelopment-relevant genes partially recapitulates the neurodevelopmental alterations in patients with mutations in ASCT1 transporter.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/376e4f07-7c0b-4a2a-b4e9-ab547c58d4cc","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Mutations in ASCT1 cause microcephaly in humans, using MRI a significant decrease in the volumes of the hippocampus and striatum of ASCT1-KO mice was found, indicating that they recapitulate some of the alterations seen in human.
