The ACTG1 gene has been reported in both autosomal dominant nonsyndromic hearing loss (NSHL) DFNA20/26 with or without vestibular involvement and Baraitser-Winter cerebrofrontofacial syndrome (BWCFFS), whose primary features include intellectual disability, trigonocephaly, hypertelorism, ptosis, arched eyebrows and secondary features include pachygyria/lissencephaly, coloboma, hearing loss, epilepsy, microphthalmia, agenesis or thickened corpus callosum (Yates 2017). 62% (8/13) of reported probands with a BWCFFS diagnosis for whom clinical information was available had some degree of hearing loss, though severity, progressivity, and age-of-onset of hearing loss were variable. Variable expressivity has been reported in one family that with hearing loss, seizures, estropia, and ocular coloboma (Kemerley 2017), as has isolated coloboma (Rainger 2017). In general, reported cases of BWCFFS are caused by missense variants that arose de novo and those causing nonsyndromic hearing loss segregate in families, however one de novo variant has been observed in an individual with NSHL (LMM unpublished data). There is no clear genotype-phenotype correlation, suggesting that phenotypes are variant-specific. This is supported by functional evidence in cell lines derived from BWCFFS patients (Riviere 2012) and in yeast containing hearing loss-causing variants (Bryan 2006). No loss-of-function variants have been reported in affected individuals, and one individual with a large deletion on chromosome 17 encompassing the ACTG1 gene did not have any of the major features of BWCFFS (Riviere 2012). Additionally, no changes in protein levels of ACTG1 in patient cell lines containing pathogenic variants in ACTG1  were observed (Riviere 2012). These data suggest dominant-negative or gain-of-function variants in ACTG1, and not haploinsufficiency, are disease-causing. An ACTG1-null mouse model has been reported (Belyantseva 2009) with progressive sensorineural hearing loss and some evidence of reduced survival and development that was absent in heterozygotes, however no loss-of-function variants have been reported in humans and all reported phenotypes are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, so the validity of this model is uncertain. According to the ClinGen guidelines for Lumping and Splitting, there is insufficient evidence to split NSHL and BWCFFS, so we propose these disorders exist along a spectrum of ACTG1-related disorders. In summary, ACTG1 is definitively associated with a spectrum of diseases that range from nonsyndromic hearing loss to severe BWCFFS. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hearing Loss Working Group on 3/20/18.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/198e96d7-db6c-484d-a91a-f1a54e704d98","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4244332d-e074-4ff7-96ac-549407ce14bb","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4244332d-e074-4ff7-96ac-549407ce14bb_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4244332d-e074-4ff7-96ac-549407ce14bb_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2018-03-20T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4244332d-e074-4ff7-96ac-549407ce14bb_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4244332d-e074-4ff7-96ac-549407ce14bb_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/45f4113f-2601-477c-99c8-5fccb51cba39","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Downgraded because no loss-of-function variants have been reported in humans and all reported phenotypes are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, so the validity of this model is uncertain.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7067d37e-3408-45b0-b691-7a2b82b1df35","type":"Finding","dc:description":"ACTG1-null mice are viable.
