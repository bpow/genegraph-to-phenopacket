{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/da23161c-a9ca-4cda-83ea-6702439dfb6av1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"The relationship between MT-ATP6 and Leigh syndrome spectrum was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of May 24, 2021. The MT-ATP6 gene encodes the ATP synthase (complex V) subunit 6. Defects of this protein lead to complex V deficiency.\n\nThe MT-ATP6 gene was first reported in relation to maternally inherited Leigh syndrome spectrum in 1992 (PMID: 1550128). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included 6 variants in 18 cases (2 with m.8851T>C, 1 with m.8993T>C, 9 with m.8993T>G, 4 with m.9176T>C, 1 with m.9185T>C, and 1 with m.9191T>C) from 12 publications (PMIDs: 9270604, 11245730, 17352390, 8554662, 9501263, 23206802, 7603783, 16217706, 1456751, 1550128, 7668837, 10604142). Of note, while Gene Curation SOP Version 8 maxes case level missense variant total score at 7, the Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel agreed the maximum score would be 12 given that the majority of pathogenic mitochondrial DNA variants are missense variants. Variants in the MT-ATP6 gene are associated with other mitochondrial phenotypes, including Neurogenic muscle weakness, ataxia and retinitis pigmentosa (NARP), axonal Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease and spinocerebellar ataxia (PMID: 30763462). Segregation information is scored as case level evidence according to the criteria established by the Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel. Loss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease association is also supported by known protein interaction, expression, functional alterations in patient cells, rescue in human cells, and animal models (PMIDs: 27977873, 25613900, 19160410, 18256697, 24316278, 17855363). \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support this gene-disease relationship, including that more than three years have elapsed from the first proposal of the association. This classification was approved by the NICHD U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on May 24, 2021 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/da23161c-a9ca-4cda-83ea-6702439dfb6a","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e492464b-cb98-4bf4-a12e-169b59576b04","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e492464b-cb98-4bf4-a12e-169b59576b04_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2021-06-28T14:54:00.928Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e492464b-cb98-4bf4-a12e-169b59576b04_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2021-06-28T14:53:50.161Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e492464b-cb98-4bf4-a12e-169b59576b04_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e492464b-cb98-4bf4-a12e-169b59576b04_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0415db93-c24b-4237-a38c-d0781a0c7e39","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"1 point for mitochondrial dysfunction in yeast.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/616ef8dd-69c8-4de6-bf74-244b5595c315","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Mutant had slow growth on respiratory substrates, attributed to a major lowering in the mitochondrial ATP synthesis rate, by about 90% compared with wild type.
