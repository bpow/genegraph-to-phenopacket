PLEC was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive epidermolysis bullosa simplex with muscular dystrophy (EBS-MD; MIM #613723) in 1996 (Smith et al., PMID: 8696340). Subsequently, biallelic variants in PLEC were identified in patients with EBS with pyloric atresia (MIM #612138; PMID: 15654962) and autosomal recessive limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD; MIM #613723; PMID: 21109228), as well as additional featuress like myasthenia. A heterozygous missense variant has been reported in association with EBS Ogna, a more mild manifestation (MIM #131950; PMID: 11851880). Alternative splicing primarily due to use of alternative first exons produces multiple plectin isoforms with unique tissue-specific expression patterns, subcellular localization, and functions, and the differential effects of variants on the various isoforms has been proposed to contribute to phenotypic variability within the spectrum of plectinopathies (PMID: 22864774, 35815343). For example, isoforms P1, P1b, P1d, and P1f are expressed in sarcomeres, with P1f also preferentially found at the neuromuscular junction, and isoforms P1, P1a, P1c, and P1f are expressed in the epidermis. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found overlap in the phenotypes associated with variation in this gene and no difference in molecular mechanism. Therefore, these disorders were lumped and a single curation performed for PLEC-related muscular dystrophy-epidermolysis bullosa simplex spectrum disorder, autosomal recessive.   \n\nEvidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Over 100 unique variants have been reported, with the majority expected to result in loss of function (PMID: 35815343). The genetic evidence for this curation includes 11 variants identified in 7 probands (PMID: 21109228, 32605089, 25556389, 28447722, 28824526, 38912134, 25209331, 29352809), including 1 start-lost variant, 5 stop-gained variants, and 5 missense variants. A homozygous 9-bp deletion affecting only the 1f isoform, NM_201378.4:c.1_9del p.(Met1_Gly3del) has been reported in seven probands with LGMD without cutaneous manifestations, shown to segregate with the disease in 3 affected family members, and appears to be a founder variant in the Turkish population (PMID: 21109228, 32605089). The maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts) was reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is loss of function. Experimental evidence includes direct interaction with the protein products of other genes associated with muscular dystrophy (PMID: 17389230), reduced P1 and specifically P1f expression in patients homozygous for the c.1_9del (p.Met1_Gly3del) variant, rescue of disrupted acetylcholine receptor clustering and desmin intermediate filament organization observed in PLEC-deficient myotubes by expression of plectin 1f (PMID: 25318670), and recapitulation of disease features in conditional knockout mice (PMID: 25318670, 26019234). In summary, there is Definitive evidence supporting the relationship between PLEC and autosomal recessive PLEC-related muscular dystrophy-epidermolysis bullosa simplex spectrum disorder. This relationship has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Muscular Dystrophies and Myopathies GCEP on April 8, 2025 (SOP Version 11).\n\nThis gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the Muscular Dystrophies and Myopathies GCEP on May 9, 2023. It was reevaluated on April 8, 2025. As a result of this re-evaluation, the classification increased from Moderate to Definitive with the expansion of the phenotype from autosomal recessive LGMD to autosomal recessive PLEC-related muscular dystrophy-epidermolysis bullosa simplex spectrum disorder. Upon re-review of the evidence for this gene, the GCEP decided there was insufficient evidence to split off PLEC-related LGMD based on isoform specificity or phenotype. The re-evaluation includes additional case-level evidence for LGMD with or without skin involvement as well as EBS-MD cases. Additional experimental evidence was also added, including decreased plectin expression in patient muscle biopsy (PMID: 21109228), protein interaction with dystrophin and β-dystroglycan (PMID: 17389230), another mouse model, and a rescue assay (PMID: 25318670).

No similar cases were detected in the family. Physical examination revealed sparse tense blisters and hemorrhagic crusts distributed over the patient's trunk and extremities. Diffuse non-scarring alopecia was found on her scalp, and onychodystrophy and/or pachyonychia were found to affect all 20 nails (Fig. 1b,c).
