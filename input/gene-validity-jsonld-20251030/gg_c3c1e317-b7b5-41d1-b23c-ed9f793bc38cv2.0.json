Variants in GNMT were first reported in\nhumans with this disease as early as 2001 (Mudd et al., PMID: 11596649). At least four variants, mostly missense, have been reported in humans in three publications (Mudd et al., 2001; PMID: 11596649; Barić et al., 2016; PMID: 27207470; Augoustides-Savvopoulou et al., 2003; PMID: 14739680). Patients with GNMT deficiency have elevated serum transaminases without other serious clinical symptoms.  Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data, including animal models and expression studies. In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Aminoacidopathy Working Group on 05/10/19 (SOP Version 6). It was reevaluated on 10/14/2022 with no new evidence found. As a result of this reevaluation, the classification remained Limited.
