The FARS2 gene encodes mitochondrial phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase 2, one of the mitochondrial aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, which function in mitochondrial translation by catalyzing the attachment of amino acids to their cognate tRNAs. Defects in tRNA charging can result in impaired synthesis of oxidative phosphorylation complex protein subunits. \n\nThe FARS2 gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Leigh syndrome spectrum in 2012 (PMID: 22499341). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included six unique variants identified in four cases from three publications (PMIDs: 22499341, 27549011, 29126765). No segregation data were available. Loss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. Of note, this gene has also been implicated in Alpers syndrome and other mitochondrial diseases which will be assessed separately. This gene-disease association is also supported by expression data, biochemical function data, and functional alterations in patient cells (PMIDs: 27977873, 26553276, 29126765). \n\nIn summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged. This classification was approved by NICHD U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on October 14, 2019 (SOP Version 7).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/45f5e645-a8df-49a0-b8cd-6409bcbca025","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2cf7594a-d934-4b6c-8052-94066d608c5a","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2cf7594a-d934-4b6c-8052-94066d608c5a_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2019-11-25T14:47:56.827Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2cf7594a-d934-4b6c-8052-94066d608c5a_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2cf7594a-d934-4b6c-8052-94066d608c5a_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8bf8c1ee-3bf2-4ce8-a1f8-116aa77bc805_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"missense variants with crystallography & non-patient cell evidence of reduced aminoacylation function (reduced tRNA binding and reduced stability)\n\nConsensus at 14 Oct. 2019 GCEP meeting was not to include: Calcarine cortex involvement and neuronal loss is more Alpers, also unilateral.","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6c2fec38-6dbe-44d5-9974-db976a3ee720","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27095821","rdfs:label":"Walker 2016 case report","ageType":"AgeAtDeath","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":15,"detectionMethod":"Dual genome panel by massively parallel sequencing identified the 2 FARS2 variants, a VUS variant in the PC gene thought not to be significant, and 2 VUS mitochondrial variants.

Developmental delay: motor and speech delays, fine motor delays, plateaued language skills. Transient elevations of serum lactate were noted as high as 6.4mmol/L (normal range 0.5-2.2 mmol/L). First seizure, a prolonged generalized tonic-clonic convulsion, occurred at 8 years of age. Epilepsy evolved and progressed, resulting in status epilepticus, and was accompanied by the development and progressive worsening of non-epileptic myoclonus. Neurological status progressively deteriorated over time. Brain MRI revealed extensive areas of abnormal T2 hyperintensity in the frontal lobes (right greater than left), anterior cingulate gyri, left superior frontal gyrus, bilateral temporal lobes, and left cerebellar cortex in the setting of recent seizure. MR spectroscopy in the left basal ganglia region demonstrated an unremarkable metabolic spectrum. Repeat multi voxel MR spectroscopy of the bilateral cerebral hemispheres one year later also showed normal metabolite ratios. Repeat MRI brain performed 2 months prior to death demonstrated the presence of the known fluid collection as well as T2 hyperintensity within the left caudate and left medial temporal lobe, and the right medial occipital lobe along the superior bank of the right calcarine sulcus with encephalomalacia of the calcaravis (figure 4). EEG findings described in text. Skeletal muscle biopsy was obtained at age 14 years and notable for predominantly type 2 fiber atrophy with rounded, atrophic fibers scattered throughout with rare regenerative fibers but without type grouping on H&E, ATPase PH 4.3, 4.6, and 9.4 stains. There was no evidence of inflammation or myonecrosis. NADH staining showed targetoid fibers. Gomoritrichome, PAS, and oil red O stains demonstrated normal patterns of staining. Combined COX/SDH stain was unremarkable. Electron microscopy revealed fibers with focal myofibrillary disarray, many myelin figures, abundant enlarged and swollen mitochondria containing glycogen and no inclusions (supplemental figure 1). Polargraphic analysis of oxidative phosphorylation demonstrated normal activity of Complexes I-IV (frozen specimen). Mitochondrial DNA content of skeletal muscle (qPCR analysis, performed at Baylor University) was reported at 61% of control (within normal). Normal pyruvate dehydrogenase, pyruvate carboxylase activity was noted in skin fibroblasts. Microscopic analysis of brain and spinal cord revealed a small brain, and a diffuse, predominantly cortical, as well as subcortical process characterized by laminar cortical neuron loss and gliosis, diminished subcortical white matter and descending corticospinal tracts. The most severely affected regions included the bilateral frontoribital cortices and the bilateral primary visual cortices. In frontorbital cortex there was almost complete absence of neurons, excessive gliosis, pale white matter, and fragmenting of the cortical layers. The primary visual cortex is notable for a devastated line of Genari, almost complete absence of neurons, excessive gliosis, pale white matter, and fragmenting of the cortical layers extending through cortical layer 5. A small region of spongiform change was noted in the right thalamus (figure 5) which was reminiscent of the spongiform lesions with relative neuronal sparing that have been reported in the basal ganglia of patients with Leigh syndrome bilaterally, though this finding was notably unilateral.","previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8bf8c1ee-3bf2-4ce8-a1f8-116aa77bc805_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27095821","allele":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0f4d4b54-c831-498a-a022-d6784541c0b1","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_006567.5(FARS2):c.403C>G (p.His135Asp)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/214339"}},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a90a0c96-5676-4290-81de-1fe899085526","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_006567.5(FARS2):c.253C>G (p.Pro85Ala)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/587669"}}],"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"}}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3dafbb7f-2f1d-4fcd-abe7-fdd7847b9143_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"exonic deletion w/ confirmed no expression","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d99d0f8b-51d4-4ff0-8be6-be1f66eedaa0","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27549011","rdfs:label":"Raviglione 2016 case report","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":3,"detectionMethod":"Microdeletion detected first by array-CGH; missense by candidate gene sequencing.","firstTestingMethod":"Chromosomal microarray","phenotypeFreeText":"Diagnosed with early infantile encephalopathy with epilepsy.

A considerable decrease of translation of mitochondrially-encoded polypeptides was detected in primary fibroblasts from probands 1 and 2 (Fig. 5). The defect in mitochondrial protein synthesis rate was, for some of the subunits, stronger in proband\n2, consistent with a more pronounced defect in aminoacylation of mttRNAPhe. The defect in synthesis rate was not general for all subunits of the same complex, e.g. for complex I a decreased synthesis of ND6 can be seen, while ND3 synthesis is comparable to controls. To investigate if the decreased translation rate of mitochondrial encoded subunits impaired the assembly of mitochondrial complexes,complex I assembly was evaluated in fibroblasts from proband 2 using an antibody against the subunit NDUFS2, which is present from the earliest subcomplexes. In normal control fibroblasts, this subcomplex was visible in 60% of cases at 7.15 ± 3.50%, maximum 13% of the fully assembled complex.

The 230 kDa subcomplex is the point at which the first mitochondrial DNA encoded subunit ND1 is added to the growing complex and an increase in the 230 kDa subcomplex is observed in other defects of mitochondrial DNA translation.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29126765","rdfs:label":"Vantroys 2017 patient cell"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2cf7594a-d934-4b6c-8052-94066d608c5a_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/42f963d4-94a0-4bee-966f-09beac48b5d3","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"scored according to GCEP rubric","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c0efc79e-b16a-4938-8218-75ba1878cc50","type":"Finding","dc:description":"According to Leigh map, there are 13 nuclear genes involved in mitochondrial translation associated with Leigh syndrome, including the mitochondrial tRNAs, EARS2, IARS2, and NARS2.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27977873","rdfs:label":"Leigh map","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionA"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/87b089d8-fcc4-4305-868a-093d256f54fb","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Expression in mitochondria and cerebellum, particularly in Purkinje cells","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3f623271-5adb-40eb-addf-4137834d6d1d","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Immunohistochemical staining of FARS2 in whole CNS serial sections from rat. The cerebellum of rat brain exhibited clear and distinguishable immunostaining signals, suggesting that FARS2 was predominantly expressed in this specific region of the brain (Fig. 2A–D). In contrast, obvious immunoreactivity was not observed in other parts of CNS including pyramidal cells of cerebral cortex and spinal motor neurons. Double immunostaining with antibodies against FARS2 and PV, a molecular marker of Purkinje cells, revealed that FARS2 was mainly expressed in the Purkinje cell of the cerebellum (Fig. 2E–G). In addition, double immunostaining with antibodies against FARS2 and COX IV, a mitochondria marker, revealed that FARS2 was colocalized with COX IV, confirming that the  subcellular location of FARS2 is in the mitochondria (Fig. 2H–M).","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26553276","rdfs:label":"Yang 2016 expression","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":3.5}],"evidenceStrength":"Moderate","sequence":438,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria6","strengthScore":8,"subject":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/dAdz9Notrw4","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0009723","gene":"hgnc:21062","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","websiteLegacyID":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/assertion_2cf7594a-d934-4b6c-8052-94066d608c5a-","@context":{"@vocab":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"},"curationReasons":{"@type":"@vocab","@container":"@set"},"GCISnapshot":{"@type":"@id"},"dc:isVersionOf":{"@type":"@id"},"websiteLegacyID":{"@type":"@id"}}}
