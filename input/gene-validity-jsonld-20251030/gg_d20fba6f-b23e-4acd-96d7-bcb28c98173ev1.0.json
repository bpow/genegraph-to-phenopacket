(PMID:31345061). In total, two probands with two homozygous variants have been identified. All probands demonstrated progressive retinal degeneration accompanied by progressive visual impairment and/or loss. Two sibilings from Ansar M et al. (PMID:31903486), presented with cardiomyopathy in addition to retinal degeneration. Cardiomyopathy was reversed and retinal degeneration was halted upon oral taurine supplementation in the proband.  Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data including biochemical function, a mouse model, and functional alteration. \n\n*SLC6A6* or TauT is a sodium and chloride dependent transporter with preference for amino acids such as taurine and alanine. TauT likely functions to transport taurine across the inner blood retina barrier and regulates taurine levels within the retina (PMID:17137607). Knock out *SLC6A6* mice recapitulated the phenotype of significant and progressive retinal degeneration observed in humans (PMID:11772953). Finally, several missense variants transfected into TauT expressing oocytes showed significant and varying degrees of taurine uptake impairment (PMID:24790004).\n\nA classification of limited was reached on 3/10/2023 by the Aminoacidopathy GCEP (SOP version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d20fba6f-b23e-4acd-96d7-bcb28c98173e","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/26addf7f-70f5-432d-abb1-0c21e297b0fd","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/26addf7f-70f5-432d-abb1-0c21e297b0fd_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10011","date":"2023-06-12T13:06:04.821Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/26addf7f-70f5-432d-abb1-0c21e297b0fd_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10011","date":"2023-03-10T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/26addf7f-70f5-432d-abb1-0c21e297b0fd_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/26addf7f-70f5-432d-abb1-0c21e297b0fd_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/dd37f728-dc3e-4589-a34a-045592a97c53","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8c6b47d8-6105-4168-88b3-f9670cd33fda","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Taut -/- mice displayed significantly decreased taurine levels compared to wild type mice across several body regions including the eye, liver, kidney, skeletal, and heart tissue.

Phenotypes initially included reduction in the number of photoreceptors and progressed to near absence of receptor segments, discs, and synapses, and near 0 response to ERG. The single defining feature of this disease across all humans probands is progressive retinal degeneration. One family from Ansar et al., found cardiomyopathy in addition to retinal degeneration.
