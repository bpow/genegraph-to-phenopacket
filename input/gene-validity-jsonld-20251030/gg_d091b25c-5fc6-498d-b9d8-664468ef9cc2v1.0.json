Individuals with heterozygous variants in *SETD1B* have been reported to present with seizures, intellectual disability/developmental delay, speech delay, motor delay, autism, behavioral disorders, facial dysmorphism, and obesity. Six variants (frameshift, nonsense, splice) that have been reported in 6 probands in 4 publications (PMIDs: 34345025, 32546566, 31685013, 38048716) are included in this curation. Additional evidence (including missense variants with supportive functional data) has been reported in the literature (PMIDs: 35385430, 31440728, 29322246, 38313655, 38108116, 31110234), but the maximum for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss of function. \n\nThe autosomal dominant gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence including animal models (mouse, PMID: 34806773, drosophila melanogaster PMID: 32346159) and protein interaction experiments (PMID: 34806773).\n\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *SETD1B* and autosomal dominant complex neurodevelopmental disorder. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen ID Autism GCEP on the meeting date 08/20/2024 (SOP Version 10). \n\nOf note, four individuals from three families with biallelic missense variants with similar neurodevelopmental phenotypes have also been reported, and are not included in this curation (PMID: 34345025). Additional information is needed to determine the role of biallelic variants in disease. \n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d091b25c-5fc6-498d-b9d8-664468ef9cc2","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/44c7e8ef-e3f7-483e-87bb-7de1c11637d4","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/44c7e8ef-e3f7-483e-87bb-7de1c11637d4_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2024-08-20T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/44c7e8ef-e3f7-483e-87bb-7de1c11637d4_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2024-09-30T20:53:15.533Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/44c7e8ef-e3f7-483e-87bb-7de1c11637d4_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/44c7e8ef-e3f7-483e-87bb-7de1c11637d4_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/430b2c03-275f-48d5-af93-e2c7b3d605cb","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4417b402-cd63-48f3-99b8-812c19df17c8","type":"Finding","dc:description":"The model shows an impairment in learning and neuronal functioning.
