The *TMEM126A* gene encodes an inner mitochondrial membrane protein that is an important complex I assembly factor in ND4-module assembly.\t\n\n*TMEM126A* was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive primary mitochondrial disease in 2009 (PMID: 19327736). While various names have been given to the constellation of features seen in those with *TMEM126A*-related disorders, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *TMEM126A* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework.\n\nEvidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included five variants (one nonsense, two missense, one splice site, one frameshift) in 11 probands from seven publications (PMIDs: 19327736, 20405026, 22815638, 30961538, 31119195, 32855858, 36071901). Optic atrophy was the most common clinical feature in affected individuals. Additional clinical features noted include hearing loss, migraines, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, myoclonic jerks, and brisk reflexes. \n\nThe mechanism of disease is loss of function. This gene-disease association is also supported by the known biochemical function of *TMEM126A* in complex I assembly, functional alteration in non-patient cells, and rescue studies (PMIDs: 33882309, 33879611). \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between *TMEM126A* and primary mitochondrial disease. This relationship has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on August 22, 2024 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2fbad81a-733b-49a7-bd91-9c8fb7583994","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6d388318-091b-4f1e-ba99-ef78619fa196","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6d388318-091b-4f1e-ba99-ef78619fa196_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2025-01-15T20:36:58.390Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6d388318-091b-4f1e-ba99-ef78619fa196_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2024-08-22T04:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6d388318-091b-4f1e-ba99-ef78619fa196_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6d388318-091b-4f1e-ba99-ef78619fa196_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/18601d5f-d4a0-4f01-a501-ac95b52ce3b4","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Proteome of KO cells, T126AKO (generated knockout cell lines using genome editing), were assessed by unbiased stable isotope labeling by/with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) \nComplex I subunits were clearly reduced in mitochondria relative to the controls\nA topographical proteomic heatmap was fitted onto the molecular structure of human complex I; subunits belonging to distinct assembly modules of complex I—N-, Q-, ND2-, and ND4-modules—were significantly reduced relative to control mitochondria. \nComplex I assembly in KO cells\nReduction in supercomplex (~50% controls) and in complex I holoenzyme (30% controls; done by immunoblotting for the complex I subunit NDUFB8 with quantification)\nA faster-migrating species at ∼440 kDa following digitonin solubilization and ∼400 kDa following Triton X-100 solubilization was also apparent (given that the NDUFB8 subunit is located at the distal end of the complex I membrane arm, this subcomplex may represent an accumulation or breakdown product of this region in the absence of proper complex I assembly)\nIn-gel NADH dehydrogenase activity showed that the residual complex I observed in T126AKO cells was still active.
