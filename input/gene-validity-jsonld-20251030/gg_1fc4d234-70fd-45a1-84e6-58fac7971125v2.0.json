{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1fc4d234-70fd-45a1-84e6-58fac7971125v2.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"The relationship between *DNM1L* and encephalopathy due to mitochondrial and peroxisomal fission defect (EMPF), inherited in the autosomal dominant manner was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of June, 2020 and updated as of April 2022. *DNM1L* encodes a member of the tripartite motif family. EMPF encompasses multiple phenotypes including lethal or non-lethal encephalopathy, delayed psychomotor development and hypotonia. Occasionally, cardiomyopathy and dystonia have also been  reported in patients. In some patients, it is accompanied by optic atrophy (PMID: 30850373,17460227), while in others, optic atrophy may be the only manifestation of disease (PMID: 28969390). Clinical evidence of a mitochondrial or peroxisomal effect may not always be seen in patients (PMID: 27145208). EMPF is also reported in the autosomal recessive mode of inheritance in a few families (PMID: 26825290, 27328748); these patients are noted, but not scored in this curation.\n\n*DNM1L* was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant EMPF in 2007. (Waterham et al, PMID: 17460227). At least 10 frameshift and missense variants have been reported in humans in the ClinVar database. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, family data and experimental data.  \n   \nSummary of Case Level Data (12 points):\nVariants in this gene have been reported in at least 15 probands in 12 publications (PMID: 31587467, 17460227, 28969390, 27145208, 26604000, 30850373, 27301544, 26931468, 33718295, 30109270). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in at least 11 additional family members. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score (12 points) for genetic evidence is reached. \n\nMost variants reported in the literature are de novo heterozygous missense variants that act in a dominant negative mechanism and interfere with protein assembly. A few patients with homozygous or compound heterozygous null variants have also been reported, in whom a loss of function mechanism is expected.    \n  \nSummary of experimental data (4 points):\nThis gene-disease association is supported by in vitro functional assays and animal models. *DNM1L* is shown to partially localize with the peroxisome and it is noted to be recruited to the peroxisome by PEX11; however, they do not interact physically (PMID: 12499366, 12618434) and mutant *DNM1L* expressed in heterologous cells show abnormal peroxisome morphology due to the fission defect, similar to that seen in patients (PMID: 12499366). Complete knock out of murine Dnm1l in mice is embryonic lethal and therefore conditional knock-out mice have been generated, which recapitulate features of EMPF in humans (PMID: 19752021, 28969390, 19578372).  \n  \nIn summary, *DNM1L* is definitively associated with encephalopathy due to mitochondrial and peroxisomal fission defect, inherited in the autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.\n\nLumping & Splitting: OMIM entities: AD/AR Encephalopathy, lethal, due to defective mitochondrial peroxisomal fission 1 (MIM# 614388); AD Optic atrophy 5 (MIM# 610708). Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in molecular mechanism AND phenotypic variability. Optic atrophy has been reported as an isolated and accompanying feature to EMPF and the molecular mechanism is reported to dominant negative in both instances (PMID: 30850373,17460227, 28969390). Autosomal recessive EMPF is reported due to a loss of function mechanism with clinical features similar to AD EMPF ( PMID: 27328748, 26825290). The AD EMPF and AD optic atrophy entities have been lumped into one entity, encephalopathy due to mitochondrial and peroxisomal fission defect (MONDO:0013726). Though the AR EMPF entity has not been lumped, these patients are noted in this curation.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1fc4d234-70fd-45a1-84e6-58fac7971125","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/320f4ab3-19c3-458e-9e81-0f380cbfebbd","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":[{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"},{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},{"id":"cg:newEvidence"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/320f4ab3-19c3-458e-9e81-0f380cbfebbd_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10049","date":"2022-04-15T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/320f4ab3-19c3-458e-9e81-0f380cbfebbd_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10049","date":"2022-04-21T21:08:05.936Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/320f4ab3-19c3-458e-9e81-0f380cbfebbd_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/320f4ab3-19c3-458e-9e81-0f380cbfebbd_seg_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/83e10378-059a-48be-a65d-b74657616707_proband_segregation","type":"FamilyCosegregation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28969390","rdfs:label":"Gerber_Family II","estimatedLodScore":2.11,"family":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/83e10378-059a-48be-a65d-b74657616707","type":"Family","rdfs:label":"Gerber_Family II","member":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/25718889-b9cc-4700-8e6f-d6b1548a8629","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28969390","rdfs:label":"Family II-III:3","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4c8a4120-8bcc-4308-8fc2-1fd75fabfe01","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_012062.5(DNM1L):c.5A>C (p.Glu2Ala)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA384359086"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypes":"obo:HP_0000648","previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"Screening of OPA1, OPA3 and WFS1 exonic sequences and of the three main mitochondrial mutations responsible for the Leber hereditary optic neuropathy was negative.

Immunofluorescence studies on patient fibroblasts showed cytoplasmic distribution of the DNM1L protein. A defect in the mitochondrial fission machinery was shown that could be rescued by expressing the wild-type DNM1L. In patient fibroblasts, peroxisomes were larger and less uniformly distributed in the cytoplasm and appeared elongated. Morphometric analysis showed reduced shape factor and increased area in the patient's cells compared to controls. The evidence is noted for information but not scored any points as the disorder shows an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern in the family.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e5d4d4c8-1ab3-4a6c-87a1-52b15723584a_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27328748","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/64ff995e-25e1-4bfb-aafe-d46bc32b27d1","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_012062.5(DNM1L):c.346_347del (p.Glu116LysfsTer6)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA6507318"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"No","zygosity":{"id":"cg:Heterozygous"}},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e5d4d4c8-1ab3-4a6c-87a1-52b15723584a_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"The frameshift variant is expected to cause NMD and this was evidenced by finding strongly reduced mRNA from the LOF allele in patient cDNA.
