Affected individuals with biallelic causal variants in *PDE6C* have since been identified in a number of subsequent publications. Phenotypes generally occur with congenital or early childhood onset and include severe color vision defects, progressive loss of visual acuity over the course of decades, reduced or absent cone/photopic ERG responses, normal rod/scotopic ERG responses, photophobia, myopia, and/or nystagmus. At least one patient has been reported with central scotoma and macular retinal pigment epithelium atrophy (PMID: 19887631). These cases with causal variants in *PDE6C* are specifically described as cone dystrophy 4 or achromatopsia 5 (MIM#: 613093), depending on the extent of disease progression at the time of diagnosis. Additional case reports have suggested an expanded spectrum of disease that includes phenotypes consistent with cone-rod dystrophy, including electroretinograms with decreased amplitude on both phototopic and scotopic waveforms and mild/moderate constrictions to visual field (PMID: 33001157). Because these diagnoses are considered part of the same phenotypic spectrum, this curation has evaluated a combination of cases under the disease term PDE6C-related retinopathy.\n\nThirteen suspected deleterious variants in *PDE6C* were scored as part of this curation (five nonsense, 1 frameshift, four missense, and three affecting splicing). These variants have been collectively reported in eight probands in three publications (PMID: 19615668, PMID: 19887631, PMID: 30080950). Three probands were homozygous for the variant of interest, but were not reported to be members of consanguineous families. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss of function in *PDE6C*, characterized in at least some cases by variants predicted to trigger the absence of the gene product or loss of the majority of its enzymatic activity. Additional genetic evidence was available (PMID: 32306724, PMID: 33001157, PMID: 37433860) but not included in this curation as the maximum scoring for this evidence type had already been reached.\n\nThis gene-disease association is also supported by evidence that *PDE6C* is highly expressed specifically in retinal tissues (PMID: 30239781). Biochemical data show that *PDE6C* encodes a cGMP phosphodiesterase that is part of the phototransduction cascade and is associated specifically with cone photoreceptor cells, consistent with the cone-specific dysfunction observed in the human patients (PMID: 19801642). This biochemical function parallels that of the *PDE6A* gene, which encodes a rod-specific cGMP phosphodiesterase and harbors loss-of-function variants associated with retinal dystrophy (PMID: 7493036). Naturally occurring zebrafish, mice, and rhesus macaque models harboring biallelic loss-of-function variants in the gene orthologous to *PDE6C* recapitulate many of the features of the human patients such as reduced visual acuity, particularly under normal lighting conditions, lack of light-adapted ERG responses, and normal dark-adapted ERG responses (PMID: 18824093, PMID: 19887631, PMID: 30667376). These models also collectively exhibit progressive thinning of the outer nuclear layer and photoreceptor outer segments within the macula, caused by rapid and progressive loss of cone photoreceptors (PMID: 18824093, PMID: 19887631, PMID: 30667376).\n\nIn summary, *PDE6C* is definitively associated with PDE6C-related retinopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both research and diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time without the emergence of contradictory evidence, leading to a definitive classification. This classification has been approved by the ClinGen Retina GCEP on November 2nd, 2023 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d9e21ce7-1dc9-4a71-a5ce-5fb8d204d012","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/73ed48ac-bdd6-4608-953d-773da6ade759","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/73ed48ac-bdd6-4608-953d-773da6ade759_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10072","date":"2023-11-02T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/73ed48ac-bdd6-4608-953d-773da6ade759_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10072","date":"2025-01-04T02:02:03.177Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["DiseaseNameUpdate"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/73ed48ac-bdd6-4608-953d-773da6ade759_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/73ed48ac-bdd6-4608-953d-773da6ade759_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/106c290b-66a1-4a0c-821c-35b61910f769","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Default scoring is considered appropriate, as PDE6C appears to be highly specifically expressed in retinal tissues.","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b5216c14-100d-4311-8c17-e346392ac804","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Transcriptomic profiling of more than 70 human tissues shows that retinal tissues exhibit the highest levels of PDE6C mRNA (https://eyeintegration.nei.nih.gov/).","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30239781","rdfs:label":"PDE6C mRNA levels are highest in retinal tissues.","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2eb48481-1a18-4629-8eda-f2daf2208a0b","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"While PDE6C is the cone-specific cGMP hydrolase, PDE6A is the rod-specific cGMP hydrolase.
