This association was made using case-level data only. At least 1 variant occurring at the stop codon has been reported in humans. BDP1 was first associated with this disease in humans as early as 2013 (Girotto et al.). Association is seen in at least 1 probands in 1 publications (24312468). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 3 additional family members. This gene-disease association is supported by an expression study. In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease association. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease association. This classification was originally evaluated by the ClinGen Hearing Loss Gene Curation Expert Panel on 9/11/2017. It was reevaluated on 3/26/2021. As a result of this reevaluation, the classification did not change.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fcd38397-0d9f-4ef3-ab24-2f8219e21255","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d300a54b-171c-4445-a138-a24409e99aae","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","changes":[{"id":"cg:sopChange"},{"id":"cg:summaryChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d300a54b-171c-4445-a138-a24409e99aae_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2021-03-31T13:16:30.176Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d300a54b-171c-4445-a138-a24409e99aae_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2021-03-26T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d300a54b-171c-4445-a138-a24409e99aae_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d300a54b-171c-4445-a138-a24409e99aae_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b34a295b-989e-4c7c-a988-b491e5db1abf","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fd8c5ba6-98f4-4274-ae00-13edd984849d","type":"Finding","dc:description":"BDP1
