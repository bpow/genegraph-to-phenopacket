Bach2 deficiency significantly affected the expression of genes with super-enhancer architecture compared to those with TEs or no enhancer mark in T cells.\n*BACH2* was first reported in relation to in 2017 (PMID: 28530713).\nA de novo heterozygous c.71T>C transition in the BACH2 gene, resulting in a leu24-to-pro (L24P) substitution was detected in a female with lymphocyte maturation defects, causing immunoglobulin deficiency and intestinal inflammation. Recurrent sinopulmonary infections, bronchiectasis and intestinal inflammation were also evident in a father and his daughter with a heterozygous point mutation in BACH2, c.2362G>A.\n\nExperimental evidence also supports a haploinsufficient model.\nBach2+/− mice had a significant reduction in FoxP3+ cells together with significant increases in CCR9+ and β7-integrin+ cells in CD4+ T cells. Immunized Bach2+/− mice exhibited minimal induction of both IgG1 class switched-B220hiCD138− B cells and B220loCD138+ plasma cells compared to WT mice (PMID: 28530713). \nThe immunophenotype of patients with mutations in BACH2 consisted of compromised Treg cells, enhanced TH1 differentiation, impaired proliferation and defective B cell maturation and Ig class switching. Silencing BACH2 in healthy control B cells, significantly suppressed in vitro class switch recombination towards the IgG and IgA isotypes.\n\nIn summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged.\n\nGene Clinical Validity Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) - SOP9\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b49acd74-fd38-4354-a089-41756bca09d1","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2473560a-6e5c-4342-a6e2-c89e37f4cc71","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2473560a-6e5c-4342-a6e2-c89e37f4cc71_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10080","date":"2023-02-21T18:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2473560a-6e5c-4342-a6e2-c89e37f4cc71_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10080","date":"2023-05-03T03:25:02.045Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2473560a-6e5c-4342-a6e2-c89e37f4cc71_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2f7928dd-dc5d-4d12-becf-735aaef3b903","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"A missence variant that was reported in a father and his son with similar phenotypes.
