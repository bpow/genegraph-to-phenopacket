Monoallelic germline MUTYH variants were first reported in relation to colorectal cancer (MONDO:0005575) in 2004 (Croitoru et al., PMID: 15523092). Of note, bi-allelic variants in MUTYH are associated with autosomal recessive familial adenomatous polyposis 2 (MONDO:0012041). Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we have split the association of MUTYH and recessive familial adenomatous polyposis 2 in another curation due to phenotypic differences and inheritance mechanism. \n\n**Summary of Case-Control Data: 3 points** \nGiven the potential for phenocopies due to the high population incidence of colorectal cancer, case-level reports were not scored for this curation. Instead, case-control studies and cohort studies were considered the strongest form of genetic evidence. In total, four case-control studies and one cohort study were included in this curation. The case-control studies included meta-analyses, aggregate variant analyses and single variant analyses. Some studies suggested a slightly increased risk for colorectal cancer in monoallelic MUTYH variant carriers compared to controls (PMID: 21063410,  24444654, 23946381) and other studies suggested no increased risk for colorectal cancer in monoallelic MUTYH variant carriers (29478780, 33309985).   \n\n**Summary of Experimental Data: 3 points**\nThere is experimental evidence showing a role for MUTYH in DNA repair (base excision and mismatch repair) pathways, including a null mouse model (PMID: 17638869) which is also a model for the recessive disorder, and in vitro functional studies (PMIDs: 24569162, 15199168, 11801590). \n\n**Overall Summary**\nIn summary, given that case-control studies show either a slightly increased risk, or no increased risk for colorectal cancer in monoallelic MUTYH variant carriers, and limited experimental data support this gene-disease relationship, the Hereditary Cancer GCEP has disputed this gene-disease association. More evidence is needed to either support or entirely refute the role MUTYH plays in autosomal dominant colorectal cancer. This gene-disease pair was originally evaluated (in relation to autosomal dominant familial adenomatous polyposis 2) as moderate by the Colon Cancer GCEP on 10/09/2017. This re-curation was approved by the ClinGen Hereditary Diseases GCEP on 03/24/2023 (SOP Version 9).\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c6bddaee-7f7b-4f49-ab0f-9a6b821e5a04","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b646b303-fb30-427c-9590-242a131624bf","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b646b303-fb30-427c-9590-242a131624bf_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10023","date":"2023-03-24T05:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b646b303-fb30-427c-9590-242a131624bf_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10023","date":"2024-04-11T17:57:19.028Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"Given that case-control studies show either a slightly increased risk, or no increased risk for colorectal cancer in monoallelic MUTYH variant carriers, and limited experimental data support this gene-disease relationship, the Hereditary Cancer GCEP has disputed this gene-disease association.","curationReasons":["RecurationNewEvidence","RecurationTiming"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b646b303-fb30-427c-9590-242a131624bf_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b646b303-fb30-427c-9590-242a131624bf_cc_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fbedc06c-bff1-4963-a547-87d3dc424159","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Contradicts","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fbedc06c-bff1-4963-a547-87d3dc424159_cc_evidence_item","type":"Finding","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33309985","rdfs:label":"BioBank Japan","caseCohort":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d1803b0f-c352-419f-8e7a-f4342c967138","type":"Cohort","allGenotypedSequenced":12503,"alleleFrequency":0.001599616092137887,"detectionMethod":"Multiplex PCR-based target sequence method","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fbedc06c-bff1-4963-a547-87d3dc424159_cc_evidence_item"}],"numWithVariant":20,"relatedCondition":{"id":"obo:MONDO_0005575"}},"controlCohort":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/428507f3-70df-435c-99d8-6a70dd4d2cf9","type":"Cohort","allGenotypedSequenced":23705,"alleleFrequency":0.001223370596920481,"detectionMethod":"Multiplex PCR-based target sequence method","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fbedc06c-bff1-4963-a547-87d3dc424159_cc_evidence_item"}],"numWithVariant":29},"lowerConfidenceLimit":0.7,"method":{"id":"cg:AggregateVariantAnalysis"},"pValue":0.37,"statisticalSignificanceType":"","statisticalSignificanceValue":1.3,"statisticalSignificanceValueType":"Odds Ratio","upperConfidenceLimit":2.4}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCaseControlAggregateVariantAnalysisCriteria"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4e242d0b-6b23-40a6-abd4-b61d5e303eca","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"PLEASE NOTE: The number of variant carriers in case and control populations was not provided.

Mutations in MSH2 and MSH6 increase risk for colorectal cancer as part of the Lynch syndrome clinical spectrum.
