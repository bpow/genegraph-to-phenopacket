The clinical presentation typically depends upon age of onset and includes visceral features, such as hepatosplenomegaly, jaundice, and pulmonary infiltrates (in some cases) in infancy, and neurological features including hypotonia and developmental delay in late infancy, with later development of ataxia, dysarthria, dysphagia, seizures, dystonia, gelastic cataplexy, and cognitive impairment. Older teenagers and young adults may present with early-onset dementia or psychiatric manifestations (Patterson, 2020, PMID: 20301473). \n\nAbout 95% of cases of NPC are caused by biallelic variants in NPC1 and 5% by variants in NPC2; symptoms in individuals with variants in these genes are indistinguishable (Patterson, 2020, PMID: 20301473). \n\nNPC2 encodes a soluble lysosomal protein with cholesterol binding properties (Xu et al, PMID: 31843136). Biallelic variants in NPC2 were first reported in patients with Niemann-Pick disease, type C2, by Naureckiene et al in 2000 (PMID: 11125141). Since then, over 20 variants have been reported in about 50 cases worldwide (Xu et al, 2019, PMID: 31843136). The disease mechanism is loss of function. In this curation, data on 8 unique variants (missense, nonsense, splice site) from 8 probands from 3 publications were collected (Millat et al, 2001, PMID: 11567215; Chikk et al, 2005, PMID: 15937921; Verot et al, 2007, PMID: 17470133). This includes c.58G>T (p.Glu20Ter), which is reported to account for >50% of Niemann Pick type C2 alleles (Millat et al, 2001, PMID: 11567215). Further information is available in the literature but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. \n\nExperimental evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes the biochemical function of NPC2, which is consistent with the biochemical and clinical findings in patients (Xu et al, PMID: 31843136); interaction of NPC2 with NPC1, another gene involved in Niemann-Pick disease, type C (Deffieu and Pfeffer, 2011, PMID: 22065762); functional alteration studies demonstrating the importance of glycosylation of Asn58 in the localization and function of NPC2 (Chikh et al, 2004, PMID: 15542393); the biochemical, clinical features, and histological features of an NPC2 hypomorphic mouse (Sleat et al, 2004, PMID: 15071184); rescue of abnormal cholesterol accumulation in NPC2 fibroblasts by medium conditioned by NPC2-expressing cells (Naureckiene et al, 2000, PMID: 11125141); and rescue of phenotypic features and visceral cholesterol accumulation in NPC-/- mice by treatment with bivine NPC protein (Nielsen et al 22073306). Additional experimental evidence is available in the literature but the maximum points for experimental evidence (6 points) has been reached. \n\nIn summary, NPC2 is definitively associated with Niemann-Pick disease, type C2. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This clinical validity classification was approved by the Lysosomal Diseases GCEP on April 5th, 2022 (SOP version #8).\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f243ef88-f3c4-477c-8a30-c3465aac68f2","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/82bb23dd-d3bc-478d-bb3d-d1928e810029","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":[{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},{"id":"cg:sopChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/82bb23dd-d3bc-478d-bb3d-d1928e810029_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10110","date":"2022-04-05T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/82bb23dd-d3bc-478d-bb3d-d1928e810029_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10110","date":"2025-01-09T14:17:36.692Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/82bb23dd-d3bc-478d-bb3d-d1928e810029_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/82bb23dd-d3bc-478d-bb3d-d1928e810029_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5097ef89-ae16-4862-b22f-0f1d87d4d9d4","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/77d49ab6-f1a1-4517-9ecd-ceb436312f89","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Surface plasmon resonance was used to show that purified NPC1 domain 2 (murine NPC1 residues V372–V622) can bind NPC2.

The role of NPC2 in cholesterol transport is outlined in Fig 2. In the late endosome/lysosome unesterified cholesterol is released by acid lipase from LDL and is then bound by NPC2. NPC2 then transfers cholesterol to either NPC1 or to the membrane. Bisphosphate and sphingomyelin on the late endosome/lysosome membrane regulate cholesterol transport by NPC2.\nIndividuals with Niemann-Pick type C accumulate large amounts of cholesterol and sphingolipids in lysosomes throughout the body, particularly the liver and brain. As a result, they suffer from severe neurological disorders and hepatic failure. A block in cholesterol transport at the level of NPC2 function is consistent with these features because lack of NPC2 prevents recycling of cholesterol out of the lysosome for further biological processes; thus cholesterol accumulates, resulting in the observed clinical symptoms in individuals with NPC.

The lower molecular weight of these mutant proteins, compared to wild type, further supported glycosylation of the wild type protein at these residues. Like wild type NPC2, both mutants were secreted. Immunolocalization studies revealed colocalization with cathepsin D, a lysosomal marker, for wild type NPC2 and p.Asn135Gln, but not p.Asn58Gln, indicating that glycosylation at Asn58 is essential for normal localization of the protein. Furthermore, while cholesterol accumulation (assessed by filipin staining) could be rescued by conditioned medium from cells expressed wild type NPC2 and from cells expressing p.Asn135Gln, medium from cells expressing p.Asn58Gln did not rescue the cholesterol accumulation phenotype.

Of note, culturing NPC2 cells in the normal medium with >10% volume untransfected conditioned medium also led to a reduction in cholesterol accumulation but to a much lesser extent, presumably due to normal production of NPC2 by CHO cells. Additional of mannose-6-phophate to the NPC2-conditioned medium prevented the reduction in cholesterol accumulation showing that uptake occurred via M6P-mediated endocytosis (a known mechanism for uptake of lysosomal proteins).
