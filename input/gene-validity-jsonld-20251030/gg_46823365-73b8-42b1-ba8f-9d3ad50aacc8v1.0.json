The SLC25A19 gene encodes a mitochondrial thiamine pyrophosphate carrier, and mediates uptake of thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) into mitochondria.\n\nPathogenic variants in SLC25A19 have been associated mainly with two phenotypes – Amish microcephaly and Leigh syndrome spectrum. \n\nThe SLC25A19 gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Leigh syndrome spectrum in 2009 (PMID: 19798730). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included five variants identified in five cases in four publications (PMIDs: 19798730, 31506564, 31295743, 28856750). No segregation data were available. Loss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease association is also supported by biochemical function and a model system (PMIDs: 18280798, 17035501). \n\nIn summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel June 8, 2020 (SOP Version 7).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/46823365-73b8-42b1-ba8f-9d3ad50aacc8","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6ae17da7-86b0-4aba-a401-de1ccb6ecb83","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6ae17da7-86b0-4aba-a401-de1ccb6ecb83_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2020-09-16T19:23:36.444Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6ae17da7-86b0-4aba-a401-de1ccb6ecb83_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2020-08-27T16:28:50.918Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6ae17da7-86b0-4aba-a401-de1ccb6ecb83_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6ae17da7-86b0-4aba-a401-de1ccb6ecb83_seg_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/854d1d42-85c2-4d0e-bcf8-42ac708d8617_proband_segregation","type":"FamilyCosegregation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19798730","rdfs:label":"Spiegel Family","estimatedLodScore":1.93,"family":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/854d1d42-85c2-4d0e-bcf8-42ac708d8617","type":"Family","rdfs:label":"Spiegel Family","ethnicity":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/"},"member":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/72a902de-9589-4492-a393-28f67c5b78d6","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19798730","rdfs:label":"Subject 2852","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":3,"detectionMethod":"","firstTestingMethod":"Linkage analysis","phenotypeFreeText":"HP:0007133, HP:0003128","previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/53b4302b-6872-42ef-85a1-fa4bb8aa9b85_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19798730","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3fd15e85-8275-4074-b96c-8cff33bf6056","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001126121.2(SLC25A19):c.373G>A (p.Gly125Ser)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA129361"}}}}},"meetsInclusionCriteria":true,"phenotypeFreeText":"HP:0003128, HP:0007133","phenotypeNegativeAlleleNegative":1,"phenotypePositiveAllelePositive":4,"proband":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/72a902de-9589-4492-a393-28f67c5b78d6"},"sequencingMethod":{"id":"cg:AllGenesSequencing"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValiditySegregationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/40bc8eb4-d2ad-4db4-9942-a2081111fbc7_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"A western blot analysis was performed using whole cell homogenate from HepG2 cells.
