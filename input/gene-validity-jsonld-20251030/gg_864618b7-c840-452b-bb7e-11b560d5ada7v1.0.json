The SDHAF1 gene encodes succinate dehydrogenase (complex II) assembly factor 1.\n\nThe SDHAF1 gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Leigh syndrome spectrum in 2009 (PMID: 19465911). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data. This curation included one homozygous variant identified in one case in one publication (PMID: 19465911). Segregation data includes 4 affected individuals and 12 unaffected individuals in one kindred (PMID: 19465911). Loss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease association is also supported by functional alteration in patient cells (PMIDs: 19465911, 22995659).\n\nIn summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on January 13, 2020 (SOP Version 7).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/864618b7-c840-452b-bb7e-11b560d5ada7","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0baf56d2-40f8-465a-9b50-22f57481a5cb","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0baf56d2-40f8-465a-9b50-22f57481a5cb_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2020-02-12T20:11:33.569Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0baf56d2-40f8-465a-9b50-22f57481a5cb_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0baf56d2-40f8-465a-9b50-22f57481a5cb_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0baf56d2-40f8-465a-9b50-22f57481a5cb_seg_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/92f8ca44-8a82-4d39-8cb1-f1354fa3f196_family_segregation","type":"FamilyCosegregation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19465911","rdfs:label":"Turkish Family Ghezzi","family":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/92f8ca44-8a82-4d39-8cb1-f1354fa3f196","type":"Family","rdfs:label":"Turkish Family Ghezzi","ethnicity":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/"}},"meetsInclusionCriteria":true,"phenotypeFreeText":"Symptoms consisted essentially of rapidly progressive psychomotor regression after a 6- to 11-month disease-free interval with lack of speech development, followed by spastic quadriparesis and partial loss of postural control with dystonia.
