At least four unique variants (two nonsense and two frameshift variants)  have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least seven probands in five publications (PMIDs:  23364359, 28259707, 30990103, 31898847, 29345414). This gene-disease relationship is supported by its protein interactions with components of BLOC-1, which regulates trafficking to lysosome-related organelles [PMID: 12923531], the biochemical function that expressing no dysbindin protein had much fewer melanosomes in the retinal pigment epithelium, and choroid [PMID: 12923531], functional alteration in the patient cells showing the negligible of the DTNBP1 protein level [PMID: 28259707] and a mouse model with the disruption of DTNBP1 protein expression had a severe simultaneous defect in melanosomes, lysosomes and/or platelet dense granules which mimic human Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome and transgenic mice carrying the entire DTNBP1 genomic region could rescue the phenotypes in the mice [PMID:1936982]. In summary, there is definitive evidence to support this gene-disease relationship and has been upheld over time.

The phenotypes of these Sandy mice are consistent with the mimic nature of these mutations with regard to coat color, platelet dense granules, and lysosome secretion. Expression of dysbindin and Platelet serotonin levels are restored in sdy/sdy transgenic mice containing BAC54F9, which contains the entire Dtnbp1 genomic region. sdy/sdy progeny containing the BAC transgene had darker coats than sdy/sdy progeny lacking the transgene. These results confirmed that mutation of dysbindin causes the sdy phenotype and that dysbindin is important for normal platelet dense granule and melanosome biogenesis [PMID:12923531].","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1936982","rdfs:label":"Sandy Mice","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/785a39b1-9c7b-4745-94b6-be6a9376ac97_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f3fc2f74-858d-4120-ae17-85a335f4897f","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Molecular analyses of human HPS-7 fibroblasts showed negligible Dysbindin protein expression and DTNBP1 mRNA level similar to the normal control.
