{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9ac8ace6-bf08-4484-8cc5-422ee1b0cf9fv1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"The relationship between PNPT1 and Leigh syndrome spectrum was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of February 26, 2020. The PNPT1 gene encodes the mitochondrial polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase), which localizes to the mitochondrial intermembrane space and functions in RNA import into the mitochondria.\n\nThe PNPT1 gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Leigh syndrome spectrum in 2012 (PMID: 23084291). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included three variants identified in three cases in three publications (PMIDs: 23084291, 28645153, 30046113). Loss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease association is also supported by biochemical function, expression, functional alteration in patient cells, and model systems (PMIDs: 20691904, 27759031, 23084291).\n\nIn summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on February 26, 2020 (SOP Version 7).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9ac8ace6-bf08-4484-8cc5-422ee1b0cf9f","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6ed99943-2ab9-417d-b0ec-ddbfa11c8645","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6ed99943-2ab9-417d-b0ec-ddbfa11c8645_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2020-03-19T19:14:29.965Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6ed99943-2ab9-417d-b0ec-ddbfa11c8645_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6ed99943-2ab9-417d-b0ec-ddbfa11c8645_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7849504b-5d70-4aac-ac84-90d59246c683_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Variant located in the catalytic domain; patient fibroblasts from demonstrated an accumulation of dsRNA (J2 signal) that was not observed in control cells (Fig. 3b).
