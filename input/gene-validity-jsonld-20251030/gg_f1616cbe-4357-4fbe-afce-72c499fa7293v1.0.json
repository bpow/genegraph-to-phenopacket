{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f1616cbe-4357-4fbe-afce-72c499fa7293v1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"The relationship between SLC25A46 and Leigh syndrome spectrum was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of August 17, 2020. The SLC25A46 gene encodes a member of the SLC25 family of mitochondrial carrier proteins. The SLC25A46 protein is involved in mitochondrial dynamics, interacting with OPA1, MFN2, and mitochondrial contact site and cristae organizing system (MICOS) complex, and is likely important for lipid transfer from the endoplasmic reticulum to the mitochondrion, and for mitochondrial fission. Pathogenic variants in SLC25A46 have been associated with other phenotypes outside the Leigh syndrome spectrum including pontocerebellar hypoplasia, optic atrophy, and parkinsonism.\n\nThe SLC25A46 gene has been reported in relation to autosomal recessive Leigh syndrome spectrum in a single publication in 2016 (PMID: 27390132). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included one homozygous variant identified in one case in one publication (PMID: 27390132). No segregation data were available. Loss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease association is also supported by biochemical function, expression data, functional alteration in patient cells, and model systems (PMIDs: 26168012, 25613900, \t26951855, 28376086, 28934388, 28376083). \n\nIn summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although the total score (7) falls in the moderate range, only one case with Leigh syndrome spectrum has been reported, therefore this gene-disease association can only reach a limited classification at this time. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on July 13, 2020 (SOP Version 7).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f1616cbe-4357-4fbe-afce-72c499fa7293","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6e456b6d-7a9b-42d2-ab51-0531f5184b41","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6e456b6d-7a9b-42d2-ab51-0531f5184b41_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2020-09-16T19:23:36.447Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6e456b6d-7a9b-42d2-ab51-0531f5184b41_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2020-08-27T16:37:57.565Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"Only one case.","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6e456b6d-7a9b-42d2-ab51-0531f5184b41_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6e456b6d-7a9b-42d2-ab51-0531f5184b41_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/83e1958f-2f40-4666-8872-e6a8addfef34","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The mouse model demonstrated a pronounced neurological and neurodevelopmental phenotype including ataxia, unsteady locomotion, tonic-clonic seizures, limb-clasping during tail suspension, reduced muscle strength, and growth retardation with premature lethality  (Score 1 pt).","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/54366507-54ab-481f-b38f-5b5981c4f96f","type":"Finding","dc:description":"This mouse model recapitulates some of the neurodevelopmental features seen in Leigh syndrome as well as premature mortality.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28376086","rdfs:label":"atc/atc SLC25A46 mouse model","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/85e7229f-d7d1-4ea0-b02d-ac1e19523a08","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The mouse model recapitulates a neurodevelopmental (ataxia, stunted growth, early mortatily) and biochemical/histological (dysfunctional OXPHOS, swollen mitochondria with abnormally shaped cristae on EM, increased ROS) phenotype seen in Leigh syndrome","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a745026e-a4b7-4dc8-93c0-7b7df76d9069","type":"Finding","dc:description":"The mouse model recapitulates a neurodevelopmental (ataxia, stunted growth, early mortatily) and biochemical/histological (dysfunctional OXPHOS, swollen mitochondria with abnormally shaped cristae on EM, increased ROS) phenotype seen in Leigh syndrome","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28934388","rdfs:label":"SLC25A46 knock out mouse model","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/00841834-95a7-48dc-b644-622e23a19027","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The SLC25A46 knockdown zebrafish model demonstrates a neurodevelopmental phenotype including alterations in swimming indicative of neuronal circuit dysfunction which recapitulates some of the neurological/neurodevelopmental symptoms seen in Leigh syndrome.
