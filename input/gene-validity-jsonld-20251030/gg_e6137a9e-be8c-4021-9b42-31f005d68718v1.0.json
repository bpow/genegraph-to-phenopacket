At least 15 variants (e.g. missense, in-frame indel, nonsense, frameshift, etc) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level and experimental data, including protein interaction, functional alteration in non-patient and patient cells and rescue in patient cells.\nSummary of case-level data: 7.3 points\nVariants in this gene have been reported in at least 15 probands in 5 publications (PMIDs: 19211612, 21920918, 29650961, 31727138, 30578397). The mechanism for disease is haploinsufficiency.\nSummary of experimental evidence: 4.5 points.\nThe gene-disease association is supported by data demonstrating protein interaction, functional alteration in non-patient and patient cells and rescue in patient cells (PMIDs: 19211612, 21920918). \nThe evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship has been replicated over more than 10 years. In summary, SMAD9 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant pulmonary arterial hypertension.
