Friedreich ataxia is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by progressive muscle weakness and ataxia, dysarthria, scoliosis, and cardiomyopathy. Homozygous inheritance of a GAA trinucleotide expansion within intron 1 of FXN accounts for 95% of Friedrich ataxia cases, while 5% of cases are due to compound heterozygous mutations including missense and nonsense mutations in FXN on one allele and the GAA trinucleotide repeat on the second allele (Burk 2017; PMID: 28405347; Delatycki 2000, PMID: 10633128). Friedreich ataxia was first described in 1863, by Nikolaus Friedreich, but it was not until 1996 that Campuzano and colleagues (PMID: 8596916) identified FXN as the causative gene responsible for Friedreich ataxia (Schulz 2013, PMID: 24024236). Many more cases are reported in the literature but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts) has already been reached. Of note, FXN is a gene that is highly conserved from bacteria to mammals, and haplotype analysis has revealed a common ancestor originating from the Franco-Cantabrian ice age refuge (reviewed in Burk 2017, PMID: 28405347). The mechanism for disease is loss of function, as the GAA trinucleotide expansion results in the loss of FXN transcript due to epigenetic regulation. Loss of FXN (frataxin) results in reduced iron homeostasis within mitochondria, and results in mitochondrial dysfunction. This gene-disease association is supported by the function of the gene product, animal models, and rescue experiments. In summary, FXN is definitively associated with Friedreich ataxia. This association has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.\n\nData on the occurrence of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) or cardiomyopathy in individuals with Friedreich ataxia was collected by the Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Gene Curation Committee (subgroup of the Cardiovascular Working Group). Loss of FXN results in the development of cardiomyopathy in ~92% of patients with Friedreich ataxia, and for 60% of these individual’s heart failure is the primary cause of death within the third to fifth decade of life (Payne and Wagner 2012, PMID: 22764179). The cardiomyopathy involved in Friedreich ataxia includes left ventricular hypertrophy, impaired myocardial perfusion, and arrhythmias. The cardiac hypertrophy observed in Friedreich ataxia was noted to differ from hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, as it is caused by increased proliferation of dysfunctional mitochondria within the cardiomyocytes which can ultimately lead to a dilated left ventricle and reduced ejection fraction (Payne and Wagner 2012, PMID: 22764179; Payne and Perverill 2012; PMID: 22373590).\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/829dfbd6-fda6-4859-99ec-1bd5155fa47d","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ec3f674b-1e71-4254-a0f9-f8909becff59","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ec3f674b-1e71-4254-a0f9-f8909becff59_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10008","date":"2021-05-28T20:18:34.686Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ec3f674b-1e71-4254-a0f9-f8909becff59_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10008","date":"2017-12-22T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ec3f674b-1e71-4254-a0f9-f8909becff59_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ec3f674b-1e71-4254-a0f9-f8909becff59_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6180d813-3e1a-4bb4-9fd4-89f30cd1c3d0","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Increased score due to several lines of evidence repeated by multiple labs.","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/be4dfb38-c01a-45ee-9cb5-6c8391d17b46","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Northern blot analysis for human tissues shows the highest expression of frataxin in the heart, followed by skeletal muscle, liever, and pancreas.
