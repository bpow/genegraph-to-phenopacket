MADB is an infancy/early childhood onset disorder (by age 2 years), with patients surviving into the third decade of life or later. It is characterized by mandibular hypoplasia, dental abnormalities, bird-like facies, joint contractures, a/hypoplastic clavicles, acral osteolysis, skin hyperpigmentation, absent or sparse hair (total or subtotal alopecia), skin atrophy, generalized lipodystrophy, and short stature.\nVariants in ZMPSTE24 have also been reported in association with the related, non-lethal progeroid disorder, Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS), and the lethal progeroid disorder, lethal restrictive dermopathy. In vitro studies with recombinant mutated ZMPSTE24 demonstrate that the severity of the pathology caused by ZMPSTE24 variants correlates with the residual enzymatic activity of the mutated enzyme (Barrowman et al., 2012 PMID:22718200). Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no phenotypic variability or differences in the molecular mechanisms between MADB and HGPS. Therefore, the following disease entities have been lumped into one disease entity, mandibuloacral dysplasia with type B lipodystrophy (OMIM:608612) and Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome. We found there was sufficient phenotypic variability and differences in the molecular mechanisms between MADB and lethal restrictive dermopathy to support splitting these disorders into two distinct disease entities. Autosomal recessive lethal restrictive dermopathy (OMIM:275210) has been curated separately.\nThirteen variants (frameshift, nonsense, and missense) that have been reported in 8 probands across 8 publications (PMID:12913070, Agarwal et al., 2006 PMID:17152860, Cunningham et al., 2010 PMID:20550970, Miyoshi et al., 2008 PMID:18435794, Ahmad et al., 2010 PMID:20814950, Ben Yaou et al., 2011 PMID:21267004, Harhouri et al., 2016 PMID:27409638, Hitzert et al., 2020 PMID:31856865) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is known to be partial loss of function.\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by animal models and in vitro functional assays (Pendas et al., 2002 PMID:11923874, PMID:21267004, PMID:18435794). In particular, in vitro assays using patient cells demonstrate an accumulation of prelamin A in addition to the lamins A and C also observed in WT cells. No accumulation of prelamin A was observed in heterozygous carriers or healthy control cells (PMID:21267004, PMID:18435794). Knockout mice show severe growth retardation, loss of subcutaneous fat layer, skeletal abnormalities including small mandible and bone fragility, loss of fur, and premature death (average lifespan of 20 weeks), likely due to dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure. Mice also show muscular dystrophy in addition to the cardiac pathology (PMID:11923874). Of note, the similarity between the knockout mouse phenotype and the human MADB phenotype supported identification of ZMPSTE24 as candidate gene for the disorder.\nIn summary, ZMPSTE24 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive mandibuloacral dysplasia with type B lipodystrophy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.\nThis classification was approved by the ClinGen Syndromic Disorders Gene Curation Expert Panel on the meeting date 06.02.2021 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4ab0a030-c4ef-434d-a30a-f920adbfda48","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3aecf4af-4d2d-4d50-a681-9f4973cc985a","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":[{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3aecf4af-4d2d-4d50-a681-9f4973cc985a_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10060","date":"2022-06-23T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3aecf4af-4d2d-4d50-a681-9f4973cc985a_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10060","date":"2022-06-30T16:14:49.087Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3aecf4af-4d2d-4d50-a681-9f4973cc985a_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ba90ca12-59f7-4bf1-b55c-0fb0f9e668db_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ba90ca12-59f7-4bf1-b55c-0fb0f9e668db","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18435794","rdfs:label":"Miy-1","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Days","ageValue":1,"allele":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d2344d9e-fa95-4421-8294-e571afa6e860","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_005857.5(ZMPSTE24):c.743C>T (p.Pro248Leu)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA116755"}},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f98d7322-0d43-4458-85dd-32d36da4ab59","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_005857.5(ZMPSTE24):c.121C>T (p.Gln41Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA116752"}}],"firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"Characteristic facial appearance, including mandibular hypoplasia, dental overcrowding, prominent eyes, and pointed nose.
