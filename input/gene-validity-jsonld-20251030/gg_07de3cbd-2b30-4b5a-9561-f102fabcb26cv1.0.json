The authors explained that because the mutant NOTCH3 protein disappeared more quickly than wild-type NOTCH3 protein, the result of lower expression was due to higher clearance speed. Additionally, the Notch3 mutant failed to fully bind to ER chaperones GRP78/BiP, binding less in a coimmunoprecipitation assay compared to WT Notch3.","functionalDataSupport":"Yes"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f6a08929-4e1a-49ec-ae8a-119512cc2e23_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24936512","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/daec25aa-a0ef-4b1e-a93d-a5ff6bd71dcb","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000435.3(NOTCH3):c.2698A>C (p.Thr900Pro)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA404517262"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Heterozygous"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":0},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/363b37ca-e62f-4e59-9d49-72ec1e927058","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The variant is ultra-rare, observed in GnomAD in the Latino population at a rate of 0.00005646 (2/35,422).
