SCAR20 is a pediatric onset disease which often involves ataxia, cerebellar atrophy, coarse facial features and intellectual disability (PMIDs 25439728, 25848753). Six variants (two stop-gain, one frame shift, one missense, one canonical splice, and one deep intronic) that have been reported in six probands in four publications (PMIDs: 25439728, 25848753, 27913285, 37485342) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is known to be loss of function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by animal models, cell culture models, and biochemical data (PMIDs 33310904, 38625743, 29635513). The effects from a loss of function or expression was shown to be more pronounced in cerebral tissue and that disruption to lipid homeostasis is likely involved in pathogenesis. In summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *SNX14* and autosomal recessive spinocerebellar ataxia 20. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Cerebellar Ataxia GCEP on the meeting date October 9, 2024 (SOP Version 11).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/21a79ee7-14d6-4f77-b358-b88be9e2e5cf","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/caf5ad64-1220-4969-bde4-1aaca1d95c3c","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/caf5ad64-1220-4969-bde4-1aaca1d95c3c_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10155","date":"2024-10-10T13:16:19.745Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/caf5ad64-1220-4969-bde4-1aaca1d95c3c_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10155","date":"2024-10-09T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/caf5ad64-1220-4969-bde4-1aaca1d95c3c_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/caf5ad64-1220-4969-bde4-1aaca1d95c3c_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1ac7fbc6-2c13-4a6c-bc2d-3676313e4cb4","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/66dec7cd-2069-46ce-bd65-4272c62e162f","type":"Finding","dc:description":"The SNX14 -/- mice recapitulated the facial dysmophia, developmental delay, ataxia and cerebellar atrophy phenotypes that are typical in human SCAR20 patients carrying SNX14 variants.
