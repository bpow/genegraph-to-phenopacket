{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f0e2a3ec-c955-4256-b25e-dad552425a08v1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"The relationship between *NFU1* and primary mitochondrial disease was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of July 11, 2023. *NFU1* encodes a protein essential to the assembly of iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters.\n\n*NFU1* was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive primary mitochondrial disease in 2011 (PMID:21944046, although this case was first reported in 2001, PMID:11156534), in an infant who died at age one month due to respiratory failure in the setting of metabolic acidosis, hyperglycinemia and multiple organ failure.  Tissue testing indicated a clear reduction in lipoate containing 2-oxoacid dehydrogenases (pyruvate dehydrogenase and alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase) as well as defects in complexes I, II, and III which is characteristic of this Fe-S cluster defect.   While various names have been given to the constellation of features seen in those with *NFU1*-related disease, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *NFU1* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework.\n\nEvidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included six unique variants (two frameshift null variants, three missense variants, and one predicted missense variant resulting in aberrant splicing) in five probands from three publications (PMIDs: 22077971, 25918518, 25758857), although many additional cases (~35) are reported in the medical literature. The p.Gly208Cys variant appears to be a Basque founder variant. Affected individuals have a strikingly similar biochemical phenotype but variable severity of their clinical phenotype. Two general clinical phenotypes have been reported. One is an infantile onset, potentially fatal, lactic acidosis with leukoencephalopathy with or without pulmonary hypertension, optic atrophy, and/or cardiomyopathy. The second is an early childhood onset hereditary spastic paraplegia with leukoencephalopathy and regression. Affected individuals show a reduction in activities and amounts of lipoate containing enzymes as well as hyperglycinemia/hyperglycinuria (PMIDs: 22077971, 25918518, 25758857). \n\nThis gene-disease association is also supported by functional implication given protein interaction with other genes involved in Fe-S cluster assembly or lipoylation (PMID: 33007329). HeLa cell models and yeast cell models replicating similar biochemical defects seen in patients (PMID: 22077971) and functional deficiencies seen in patient cells (PMID:36256512) were also included in scoring. \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between *NFU1* and primary mitochondrial disease. This has been repeatedly demonstrated and upheld over time, and no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts this gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on July 11, 2023 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f0e2a3ec-c955-4256-b25e-dad552425a08","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1adb01f7-d226-4f55-ab00-adb513c20e80","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1adb01f7-d226-4f55-ab00-adb513c20e80_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2024-01-16T15:46:41.995Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1adb01f7-d226-4f55-ab00-adb513c20e80_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2023-07-11T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1adb01f7-d226-4f55-ab00-adb513c20e80_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1adb01f7-d226-4f55-ab00-adb513c20e80_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ea690336-5fac-40af-95df-aa51f935fbae","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"0.5 points for replicating PDH and SDH defects in yeast with deleted NFU1 (only score 0.5 because yeast model with normal WT growth rate)","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4a95d7da-deeb-4d97-b1bc-f6cb289c2f4d","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Previously, no specific defects that would allow mechanistic conclusions had been observed upon deletion of yeast NFU1 as they show WT growth rates\n\n\nUsing the information gained from studies on humans, we analyzed several enzyme activities in\nnfu1D yeast cells in which NFU1 was deleted. \nAlthough there was only a small (1.3-fold) decrease in aconitase and COX activities, we observed substantial (>4-fold) decreases in SDH and PDH activities, in striking similarity\nto the individuals’ phenotype (Figure 6A).","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22077971","rdfs:label":"Yeast studies ","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/90419cf5-4d9a-4ce5-b69b-dbe91bf110e6","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Score 0.5 for SDH and PDH deficiency consistent with deficient in protein bound lipoic acid- deficiencies ","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c165d77b-2c29-4f02-8ad4-669f9e61e6bd","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Growth of NFU1-depleted cells was slightly decreased as compared to mock-treated or scrambled siRNA controls (Figure S4). \n\nImmunoblotting of cell extracts revealed markedly decreased levels of lipoic acid bound to the E2 subunits of PDH and a-KGDH as well as to the H protein of GCS (Figure 4C). \n\nConsistent with these findings, PDHC activity was not detectable after NFU1 depletion for 9 days (Figure 4D).
