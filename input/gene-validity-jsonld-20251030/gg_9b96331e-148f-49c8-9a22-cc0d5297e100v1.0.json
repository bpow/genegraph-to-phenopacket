Defects of this protein lead to complex I deficiency. \n\n*MT-ND5* was first reported in relation to primary mitochondrial disease in 1993 (PMID: 8213825). While various names have been given to the constellation of features seen in those with *MT-ND5*-related disease, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *MT-ND5* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework. Of note, *MT-ND5* was previously curated by this panel for its association with Leigh syndrome spectrum (LSS) on May 24, 2021 (SOP v8), with a final classification of definitive. This current curation for the association with primary mitochondrial disease includes cases with LSS.\n\nEvidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation includes six variants (m.12706T>C, m.13042G>A, m.13063G>A, m.13094T>C, m.13511A>T, m.13513G>A) in 24 probands from 11 publications (PMIDs: 17400793, 11938446, 12624137, 18495510, 23918514, 17535832, 29506874, 23034978, 16816025, 9299505, 18977334). All curated variants were missense, including two recurrent variants (m.13513G>A and m.13094T>C). Cybrid studies further supported the pathogenicity of several variants (PMIDs: 17535832, 18977334).  Affected individuals present with a broad phenotypic spectrum of disease including Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON); mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS); LSS; myoclonus epilepsy, ragged red fibers (MERRF); and cardiomyopathy.  The age of onset is also highly variable, ranging from infantile to adult. Muscle biopsies variably revealed ragged red fibers, isolated complex I deficiency, and variable combined deficiencies of complexes I, III, and/or IV. Metabolic screening labs showed elevated lactate in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood and urinary excretion of Krebs cycle intermediates. Heteroplasmy levels in affected individuals ranged from 28% - 90% in skeletal muscle, 23% to 77% in blood, undetectable to 90% in fibroblasts, 51% - 81% in urine; and ranged in healthy family members from undetectable to 20% in blood, undetectable to 25% to 95% in hair follicles, undetectable to 4-6% muscle, and ranged from 27%-45% in other tissues such as urine and buccal samples in healthy family members.\n\nLoss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease association is also supported by a known biochemical function shared with other genes associated with primary mitochondrial disease and functional alteration in patient iPSC derived neurons and cybrid cell lines (PMIDs: 27509854, 26159306).    \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support this gene-disease relationship, including that more than three years have elapsed from the first proposal of the association. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on May 3, 2023 (SOP Version 9).

Decreased mitochondrial mass was reported in the fibroblasts: A defect in complexes I, III+V and IV was detected when normalizing with GAPDH but not when normalizing with both CS and GAPDH (Figure 1B). Analysis of enzymatic activities of respiratory complexes highlighted a normal function of complexes II, III and IV (CS normalized) but a decreased activity of CS in LS fibroblasts (Figure 1C), supporting a decrease in mitochondrial mass as the main contribution to the lower levels of respiration. Extracellular lactate measurements demonstrated that LS fibroblasts produced more than twice the lactate generated by control fibroblasts. 2. iPSC line, LND554SV.4,m.13513G>A at 45% heteroplasmy, derived from the patient fibroblasts. A control line was also generated from normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDFs); iPSC line (N44SV.1). The LND554SV.4 line showed a defect in the activity of complexes I and III of LS iPSC (Figure 2C). Similar to fibroblasts, lactate levels were increased in LS iPSCs as compared to control iPSCs (Figure 2D). 3) Neural stem cells (NSCs) were derived from both patient and control iPSCs and stained positive for the NSC marker nestin (Figure 3A). The m.13513G>A mutation was retained in patient NSCs at a percentage of 19.26%. The NSCs were differentiated into neurons over 6 weeks (iPSC-iNs). LS neural stem cells (NSCs) manifested similar proliferative and differentiation capacity (Fig3.) Fig 4. iNs co-cultured with mouse astrocytes showing a marked neurodegeneration in the patient in comparison with the control both at days 21 and 42. Seahorse XFe96 Analyzer was used to quantify oxygen consumption whilst the neurons were in culture, showing a reduced basal and maximal respiration in patient cells as well as reduced complex I contribution. Patch clamp studies were used to demonstrate no abnormalities in intrinsic properties or AP characteristics of patient neurons as compared to control. Intracellular calcium concentrations were analyzed by live cell calcium imaging in NSC-derived neurons, after 6 weeks of differentiation and used to demonstrate a Ca2+ buffering defect.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32366037","rdfs:label":"Galera-Monge_iPSC MT-ND5 m.13513G>A"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/790d6853-22b2-41da-9a09-93a67791dd61","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Cybrid study demonstrating OXPHOS deficiency which is rescued upon mitoTALEN treatment and restoration of wildtype mitochondrial DNA levels.
