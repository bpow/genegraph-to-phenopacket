RDH12-related dominant retinopathy is associated with late onset cases typically diagnosed as retinitis pigmentosa with a milder phenotype, characterized by nyctalopia and visual field loss, but relatively preserved central vision. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping & Splitting Working Group, the difference in inheritance pattern and phenotypic variability between autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive cases led them to be split into separate disease entities. The split curation for RDH12-related recessive retinopathy has been performed separately.\n\nThis curation includes three frameshift variants that have been reported in 4 probands in 3 publications (PMIDs: 18779497, 32322264, 34031043). The score for genetic evidence is 6.5 points. The mechanism of pathogenicity is reported to be gain-of-function, most likely due to the creation of an alternate reading frame predicted to escape NMD and lead to a truncated protein with altered C-terminus.\n\nThis gene-disease association is also supported expression studies and *in vitro* functional assays (PMIDs: 12226107, 15865448). The RDH12 enzyme catalyzes the reduction of all-trans-retinal and its 9-cis-, 11-cis-, and 13-cis-retinal isomers in the presence of NADPH (PMID: 12226107). Human *RDH12* mRNA is most highly expressed in retinal tissues (PMID: 15865448).  The experimental evidence score is 1.5 points. \n\nIn summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Retinal Gene Curation Expert Panel on March 3rd, 2022 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/af290916-4ab5-41f9-94e9-41480eb21dfb","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/958d5e41-ea0c-4497-af02-56d6ed3cd341","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/958d5e41-ea0c-4497-af02-56d6ed3cd341_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10072","date":"2025-01-04T20:54:44.600Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/958d5e41-ea0c-4497-af02-56d6ed3cd341_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10072","date":"2023-03-02T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/958d5e41-ea0c-4497-af02-56d6ed3cd341_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/958d5e41-ea0c-4497-af02-56d6ed3cd341_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fae987e1-3656-47df-a628-7a531cb6020f","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2b152fcd-5ced-4c44-940e-2742d3a0594f","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Figure 5, 6A, C-D","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12226107","rdfs:label":"RDH activity with various isomers of retinals","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionA"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1e6f4263-4cc7-4ae2-9b58-972d8791cbff","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/274b6c7f-97b9-41a1-bbf6-d8ee757998b0","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Quantitative RT-PCR was carried out on cNDA form human retina samples with primers specific for RDH12 along with other tissues including liver, muscle, brain, kidney and more.
