It typically presents in childhood with hepatosplenomegaly and progressive neurodegeneration characterized by cerebellar ataxia, dysphagia, and dementia, resulting in a shortened lifespan. There are more severe infantile forms, the most severe of which is the neonatal, rapidly progressing cholestatic form. Late-onset forms also occur, presenting with early-onset dementia or psychiatric symptoms (Erikson et al, 2013, PMID: 23292954; Newton et al, PMID 30205941; Patterson, 2020, PMID: 20301473). There is no curative treatment. Miglustat has been approved for the management of neurologic symptoms in some countries (Patterson, 2020, PMID: 20301473).\n\nFeatures of NPC that can be prenatally identified by fetal imaging include ascites in the third trimester, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, placentomegaly, and hydrops. Neonates may have hypotonia, thrombocytopenia, and jaundice. Death in the neonatal period from respiratory or liver failure is common with these early presenting cases (PMIDs: 18554276, 19206179, 23597521, 26563327, 28951965, 28802248).\n\nAbout 95% of cases of NPC are caused by biallelic variants in NPC1 and 5% by variants in NPC2 (Patterson, 2020, PMID: 20301473). NPC1 encodes a an integral membrane protein with at least 13 transmembrane domains and a putative sterol sensing domain, located in the lysosomal membrane and involved in transport of cholesterol from the lysosome to the cytoplasm (Bauer et al, 2002, PMID 11754101).\nBiallelic variants in NPC1 were first reported in patients with NPC in 1997 (Carstea et al, PMID: 9211849). Since then, over 200 disease-associated variants have been reported (Patterson, 2020, PMID: 20301473). In this curation, data on 10 unique variants (5 missense – one of which also impacts splicing, 3 nonsense, and 2 frameshift) from 10 probands from 4 publications were collected (Greer et al, 1998, PMID: 9634529; Yamomoto et al, 1999, PMID: 10480349; Millat et al 2001, PMID: 11333381; Fancello et al, 2009, PMID: 19252935). This includes c.3182T>C (p.Ile1061Thr), which is reported to account for 15%-20% of pathogenic variants in Western Europe the USA (PMID: 16126423). In addition, data on c.2974G>T (p.Gly992Trp), a founder variant in the Acadian population of Nova Scotia (Greer et al, 1998, PMID: 9634529) was also curated. This variant was reported to cause a condition originally described as Niemann-Pick disease, type D (NPD), but which now known to be a subtype of NPC. Segregation data was also available from the Nova Scotian population (Greer et al, 1999, PMID: 10361985). The disease mechanism is loss of function. Further information is available in the literature but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. \n\nExperimental evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes the biochemical function of NPC1, which is consistent with the biochemical and clinical findings in patients (Ifante et al, 2008, PMID: 18772377; Li et al, 2016, PMID: 27551080; Newton et al, 2018, PMID: 30205942), interaction of NPC1 with NPC2, which is encoded by another gene involved in Niemann-Pick C disease (Deffieu and Pfeffer, 2011, PMID: 22065762), the biochemical and clinical features of a mouse with a knock-in human variant (Praggastis et al, 2015, PMID: 26019327), rescue of abnormal cholesterol accumulation in NPC fibroblasts by expression of NPC1 cDNA (Carstea et al, 1997; PMID: 9211849) and the impact of gene therapy in a mouse knock out model (Kurokawa et al, 2021, PMID: 33256498). Additional experimental evidence is available in the literature but the maximum points for experimental evidence (6 points) has been reached. \n\nIn summary, NPC1 is definitively associated with Niemann-Pick disease type C1. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This clinical validity classification was approved the the Lysosomal Diseases GCEP on March 1, 2022 (SOP V8), and details of the prenatal presentation of the disease, provided by the ClinGen Prenatal GCEP were added on Jan 9, 2025.\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/31f1ff6f-6532-4cb2-b6f0-c6f38a13328f","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e8459873-2577-43ff-966c-e5180683d4f4","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e8459873-2577-43ff-966c-e5180683d4f4_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10110","date":"2022-03-01T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10106","role":"SecondaryContributor"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e8459873-2577-43ff-966c-e5180683d4f4_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10110","date":"2025-01-09T14:14:26.197Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e8459873-2577-43ff-966c-e5180683d4f4_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e8459873-2577-43ff-966c-e5180683d4f4_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3f5a3408-ca92-4953-84d6-0530b9ba7c14","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/48f2750b-dd9e-4ced-adee-366849286b1d","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Surface plasmon resonance was used to show that purified NPC1 domain 2 (murine NPC1 residues V372–V622) can bind NPC2.

In contrast, binding and dissociation of cholesterol for NPC2 is rapid at both temperatures. Bidirectional transfer of cholesterol between NPC1(NTD) and liposomes is accelerated >100-fold by NPC2.

This process begins with internalization of LDL, and its transport to the lysosome where cholesteryl esters are hydrolyzed by lysosomal acid lipase cleaves to free fatty acids (FFA) and cholesterol. Free cholesterol within the lysosomal lumen is bound by the NPC2 protein and transferred to the NPC1 protein localized in the lysosomal membrane. NPC1 then transports cholesterol across the lysosomal membrane into the cytoplasm, where cholesterol can enter other metabolic pathways. \nWhen NPC1 is absent, cholesterol as well as sphingolipids accumulate inside the lysosomes. Previous studies have demonstrated the intracellular accumulation of low density lipoprotein (LDL)-derived, unesterified cholesterol in fibroblasts from patients and in a natural mouse model. Structure-function studies have continued to shed light on the distinct functional domains of the NPC1 protein but the exact mechanism of transport of cholesterol, and also the reason for accumulation of sphingolipids, is not yet understood.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30205942","rdfs:label":"Review of evidence for NPC1 function","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e8459873-2577-43ff-966c-e5180683d4f4_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6aef5ecf-6f7a-4038-bfdc-3bfb6a70fcdc","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c90245d0-8f46-4fa7-b941-947a29a300bf","type":"Finding","dc:description":"NPC1 cDNA was expressed by transient transfection in fibroblasts from an individual with NPC (genotyped).

From RT-PCR of cDNA from all 3 patients, a normal sized band and a band with a 227 bp deletion was detected (approx. equal intensity for the homozygotes, see Fig 1A). The deletion was later shown to be due to skipping for exon 9, predicted to cause a 75 amino acid deletion, frameshift, and premature termination in exon 10. The normal-sized band represent cDNA that encodes a missense variant, p.Arg518Gln (Fig 1B).
