At least 10 unique de novo missense variants have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 10 probands in at least 5 publications (PMIDs: 23001566, 22333901, 19465910, 26732629, 25059107). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 2 additional family members. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism for disease is dominant negative (19465910). This gene-disease relationship is supported by animal models, expression studies, and in vitro functional assays. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for experimental evidence (6 pts.) has been reached. In summary, TUBB2B is definitively associated with autosomal dominant Complex cortical dysplasia with other brain malformations. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Brain Malformations Gene Curation Expert Panel on 4/26/20 (SOP Version 7).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e64115a0-7eba-4fa1-8ea0-16ca7650493a","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/81ced164-4ef1-4256-a727-84e79930efcc","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/81ced164-4ef1-4256-a727-84e79930efcc_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10020","date":"2021-02-25T03:34:36.961Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/81ced164-4ef1-4256-a727-84e79930efcc_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10020","date":"2020-04-26T04:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/81ced164-4ef1-4256-a727-84e79930efcc_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/81ced164-4ef1-4256-a727-84e79930efcc_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5268d42b-3e52-4e12-b728-d72a6715fcd8","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"This was basically an in vivo expression experiment and the mouse model was not further phenotyped.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1808459b-f67b-4461-a5c3-995f554a39c5","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Sectioning and imaging of the corpus callosum at P6 and P14 demonstrated that the variant perturbed connectivity along the cortical midline.
