One disease assertion has been reported in association with this gene: osteopetrosis, autosomal recessive 2 (MIM:259710, MONDO:0009816). Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, there was no evidence of differences in molecular mechanism, phenotypic variability, and inheritance pattern. Therefore the following disease entity has been lumped into one entity: TNFSF11 and TNFSF11-related osteopetrosis (MONDO: ID requested). \n\nTNFSF11 was first reported in connection with TNFSF11-related osteopetrosis in 2007 (Sobacchi et al. 2007 PMID: 17632511). Patients with this disease may present with optic atrophy, blindness, cranial nerve involvement, hydrocephalus, severe cerebral bulbar deterioration, severe growth inhibition, severely impaired and/or delayed dentition with chronic parotid/mandibular abscess, short stature, hepatosplenomegaly, anemia, hypocalcemic seizure, and hypocalcemia (PMID: 34056870). \n\nSix variants (2 frameshifts, 2 missense, 1 deletion, 1 splice site) reported in four publications have been included in this curation (PIMDs: 39011244, 34056870, 23762088, 17632511). This gene-disease relationship is also supported by two non-human model organisms (PMIDs: 10984520, 22068587), protein interaction (PMID: 22664871), biochemical function (PMID: 32850393), skeletal and extraskeletal expression (PMID: 9568710), and rescue in a non-human model organism (PMID: 23762088). \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between TNFSF11 and TNFSF11-related osteopetrosis. The classification was approved by the ClinGen Skeletal Disorders GCEP on meeting date 12/02/2024 (SOP Version 11)","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/526ec065-5099-459a-850e-f54aaf805f3e","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/90e426a0-23df-43d0-951c-ab6d7eb41158","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/90e426a0-23df-43d0-951c-ab6d7eb41158_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10065","date":"2024-12-02T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/90e426a0-23df-43d0-951c-ab6d7eb41158_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10065","date":"2025-01-07T16:41:53.440Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/90e426a0-23df-43d0-951c-ab6d7eb41158_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/90e426a0-23df-43d0-951c-ab6d7eb41158_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/271c1702-2c9a-4795-861c-3527cd6b597e","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7984b213-988d-4ed8-abfc-7d41934ab0c7","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Patients with TNFSF11 - Related Osteopetrosis present with delayed dentition, severe osteopetrosis, growth inhibition, and hepatosplenomegaly, features that are recapitulated in this mouse model.
