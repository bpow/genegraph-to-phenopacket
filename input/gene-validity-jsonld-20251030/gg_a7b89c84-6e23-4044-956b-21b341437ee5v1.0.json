The variant segregated with disease in 5 members from 1 family (PMIDs: 27023905, 33643381, 34194829). The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss-of-function based on in-vitro studies looking at channel function for p.Cys113Tyr (PMID: 27023905). This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence. Expression-level data from the gEAR database indicates solid expression in the cochlear duct and pillar cells in the organ of Corti. In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hearing Loss GCEP on the meeting date 9/17/2025 (SOP Version 11).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a7b89c84-6e23-4044-956b-21b341437ee5","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a0bbbf84-878a-4863-a82c-14012e61d8f4","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a0bbbf84-878a-4863-a82c-14012e61d8f4_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2025-09-23T15:12:32.378Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a0bbbf84-878a-4863-a82c-14012e61d8f4_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2025-09-23T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"The total score for this curation should technically be 3.1 pts., not 3.0 pts., as the GCI would not allow entry of the exact score for 1 case of genetic evidence, as noted in the entry for that case.
