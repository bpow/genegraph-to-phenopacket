At least 2 unique variants (nonsense and splice acceptor site) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level and experimental data.\n\nSummary of Case Level Data (3 Points):\nVariants in this gene have been reported in 2 probands in 1 publication (PMID:30521495). Phenotypes described in these probands include recurrent upper and lower respiratory tract infections, recurrent pneumonia, and bronchiectasis. Probands show defective antibody production (including T cell–dependent and –independent vaccine responses to poliovirus, tetanus, diphtheria toxoids, and pneumococcal immunizations). Patients may also have increased susceptibility to varicella zoster virus and herpes simplex virus. There is possibility for T cell defects due to the nature of these viral infections. \n\nExperimental Evidence\nThis gene-disease association is supported by animal models, expression studies, protein interaction studies, and functional alteration experiments. The ARHGEF1 gene encodes a member of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor family, which modulates the activities of the RAS superfamily (PMID: 8810315). ARHGEF1 is predominantly expressed in hematopoietic cells and lymphoid tissue (PMID: 9135076) and is specific for the GTPase RhoA (PMID: 30521495, PMID: 8810315). ARHGEF1 is involved in the signaling of G protein-coupled receptors associated with G-alpha 12/13-containing heterotrimeric G proteins (PMID: 11526402, PMID: 30521495). Experimental evidence indicates that ARHGEF1 activity in human lymphocytes is involved in controlling actin cytoskeleton dynamics, restraining PI3K/AKT signaling (PMID: 30521495), and localizing and confining B lymphocytes and myelocytes within their dedicated functional environment. Data suggest that immune deficiency primarily results in intrinsic defects in the trafficking and localization of B lymphocytes, causing a secondary defect in T-cell function. \n\nIn summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. \n\nThe clinical validity classification for this gene-disease relationship has been modified from a moderate classification to limited. The Gene-Disease Clinical Validity SOP requires at least 3 unrelated probands from at least 2 independent reports to get above the Limited classification.\n\nThis classification was approved by the ClinGen Humoral Defects GCEP Working Group on January 19, 2021(SOP Version 8). \n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d89b760f-2514-4d90-852c-a27427cdee05","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9547c192-135d-48b3-a1c0-2eca5e2608c5","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9547c192-135d-48b3-a1c0-2eca5e2608c5_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10080","date":"2021-01-19T21:47:11.722Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9547c192-135d-48b3-a1c0-2eca5e2608c5_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10080","date":"2021-01-19T21:48:41.478Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"SOP requires at least 3 unrelated probands from at least 2 independent reports to get above the Limited classification","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9547c192-135d-48b3-a1c0-2eca5e2608c5_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9547c192-135d-48b3-a1c0-2eca5e2608c5_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d340ced2-7fe7-4364-ba20-c2ff503c2019","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"These data supported the possibility that MZB cells have a role in TI-2 responses and showed that TD humoral responses require Lsc.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/aef25153-712b-490a-9fc8-3099d7a622d4","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Authors analyzed basal serum amounts of IgM, IgG1, IgG2b, IgG3, IgA and IgE and found they were normal in Lsc−/− mice (data not shown).

Induction of RhoA activity upon LPA stimulation was impaired in T cell blasts from both patients as compared with healthy donor cells.

Expression of the chemokine receptor CCR7 was higher on patient CD8+ naive T cells than on controls. Normal serum immunoglobulin levels. Patient's mother exhibited normal lymphocyte subsets. Patient had bronchial mucoepidermoid carcinoma, mediastinal lymph node biopsies: lymph nodes free of malignant cells. Immunohistochemical analysis suggests disturbed GC reaction was combined with a relatively intense plasma cell development.","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d8d1a85d-aef5-496b-a9ce-82bba97e9fc2_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30521495","allele":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b3f52436-d875-4840-9fc8-4cfe6566b57f","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_004706.4(ARHGEF1):c.853C>T (p.Arg285Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA406052995"}},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/50e41ed7-12b8-4449-ab93-11da66447673","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_004706.4(ARHGEF1):c.1624-1G>T","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA406062075"}}],"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"none"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":3},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9547c192-135d-48b3-a1c0-2eca5e2608c5_seg_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3e81de97-f4f9-478d-852a-3f09de0b43c0_proband_segregation","type":"FamilyCosegregation","dc:description":"3 affected individuals are needed for AR inheritance","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30521495","rdfs:label":"PAD Family","estimatedLodScore":0.85,"family":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3e81de97-f4f9-478d-852a-3f09de0b43c0","type":"Family","rdfs:label":"PAD Family","member":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ab9acf89-244d-4067-963a-c0a5c9742a0c"}},"meetsInclusionCriteria":false,"phenotypeFreeText":"The patients’ clinical and immunological characteristics were indicative of a PAD due primarily to disturbed B lymphocyte functions.","phenotypeNegativeAlleleNegative":2,"phenotypePositiveAllelePositive":2,"phenotypes":["obo:HP_0002110","obo:HP_0006532","obo:HP_0200117"],"proband":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ab9acf89-244d-4067-963a-c0a5c9742a0c"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValiditySegregationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":3}],"evidenceStrength":"Limited","sequence":1859,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria8","strengthScore":9,"subject":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/Pt5NsdipKoA","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0032763","gene":"hgnc:681","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","websiteLegacyID":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/assertion_9547c192-135d-48b3-a1c0-2eca5e2608c5-","@context":{"@vocab":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"},"curationReasons":{"@type":"@vocab","@container":"@set"},"GCISnapshot":{"@type":"@id"},"dc:isVersionOf":{"@type":"@id"},"websiteLegacyID":{"@type":"@id"}}}
