The GFM1 gene encodes mitochondrial elongation factor G1 (also referred to as EFG1 or EGF1), that is one of three nuclear-encoded elongation factors and plays an important role in mitochondrial translation. \n\nThe GFM1 gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Leigh syndrome spectrum in 2007 (PMID: 17160893). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included six unique variants identified in three unrelated cases from three publications; all cases were compound heterozygous for a predicted null variant and a missense variant (PMIDs: 217160893, 23430926, 25852744). No segregation data were available. Loss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. Of note, this gene has also been implicated in other mitochondrial diseases (including fatal infantile hepatopathy) which will be assessed separately. This gene-disease association is also supported by known biochemical function, expression, functional alteration in patient cells, functional alteration in non-patient cells, rescue in patient cells, and rescue in animal models (PMIDs: 17160893, 18853439, 27977873, 21364917, 25852744).\n\nIn summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel December 9, 2019 (SOP Version 7).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/be2eb2f9-e98c-48e1-b638-6c9be0a9f788","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/154a8f96-7062-49c7-9aaa-b23a98655f40","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/154a8f96-7062-49c7-9aaa-b23a98655f40_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2019-12-19T18:51:08.232Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/154a8f96-7062-49c7-9aaa-b23a98655f40_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/154a8f96-7062-49c7-9aaa-b23a98655f40_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0b8ea210-9be8-474d-8f51-1aa5657cc8f6_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"stop-gained in trans with missense w/ crystallography evidence and non-patient & patient cell evidence of mitochondrial disorder (yeast complementation & rescue)","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ca77755c-9002-46dc-afef-2db52dbc3cd3","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17160893","rdfs:label":"patient I.V.","ageType":"AgeAtDeath","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":16,"detectionMethod":"candidate gene sequencing; Sequence analysis of the entire mtDNA from muscle did not identify variants in syn or mit genes.
