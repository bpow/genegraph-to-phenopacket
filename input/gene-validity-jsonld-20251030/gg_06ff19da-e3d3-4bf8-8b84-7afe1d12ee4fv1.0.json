{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/06ff19da-e3d3-4bf8-8b84-7afe1d12ee4fv1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"MAOA was first associated with disease in 1993 in a large Dutch family with 14 individuals (consistent with X-linked inheritance) affected by Brunner syndrome.  Brunner syndrome is characterized by  borderline intellectual disability (ID), prominent behavioral abnormalities including aggressive and violent behavior, and  deficiency of monoamine oxidase A enzymatic activity as shown by Brunner et al in 1993 (PMIDs 8211186, 8503438). The gene-disease relationship includes case-level, segregation and experimental data. Loss of function variants in the MAOA coding region have been reported in at least 6 probands (3 nonsense, splice, frameshift and 3 missense) in 5 publications (PMIDs 8211186, 24169519, 25969726, 25807999, 29158550). Variants in this gene segregate with disease in at least 1 large family (PMID 8211186) and 2 siblings (PMID: 25969726, 25807999).The maximum genetic evidence score was reached after awarding missense variants with supporting biochemical evidence (loss of MAOA enzymatic activity) 1.5 points (equal to the number of points awarded to putative null variants), since deficiency of MAOA activity is a specific hallmark of loss of MAOA function. The gene-disease relationship is supported by a number of independent animal model studies including PMIDs 7792602 and 18418249. In summary, there is sufficient evidence to support definitive association between MAOA with Brunner syndrome. Although clinical diagnosis of Brunner syndrome is rare, the gene-disease association has been demonstrated in multiple reports and animal model studies that has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel on 1/15/20 (SOP Version 7).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/06ff19da-e3d3-4bf8-8b84-7afe1d12ee4f","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/20ffc014-ef31-4693-91c4-424bbe1e48dd","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/20ffc014-ef31-4693-91c4-424bbe1e48dd_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2020-04-14T20:39:50.820Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/20ffc014-ef31-4693-91c4-424bbe1e48dd_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/20ffc014-ef31-4693-91c4-424bbe1e48dd_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/20ffc014-ef31-4693-91c4-424bbe1e48dd_ad_null_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fe6938a6-c5f7-4f8b-ad00-c56b51a03f45_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bfc33c57-9908-40c7-a160-6d7f62781f19","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25807999","rdfs:label":"Family H:III-1","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":59,"detectionMethod":"X-chromosome exome","firstTestingMethod":"Next generation sequencing panels","phenotypeFreeText":"mild intellectual disability, obsessive behavior, limited friendships and were introverted and placid during clinical interview, Abnormal aggressive, impulsive or violent behavior","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001256","obo:HP_0000722","obo:HP_0006919"],"previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"normal Karyotype, chromosomal microarray, fragile X, FRAXE PCR, 6 ID gene screen","secondTestingMethod":"PCR","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fe6938a6-c5f7-4f8b-ad00-c56b51a03f45_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25807999","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e0e1eccd-4b88-46df-b45f-39078bc7ee1c","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000240.3(MAOA):c.749_750insT (p.Ser251fs)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA204423"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"}}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNullCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0c69cd79-1a17-4f84-9a71-b8146fd583b1_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7313e05f-9019-40af-9641-c392b9909f3a","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25969726","rdfs:label":"ASD_16","ageType":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/","ageUnit":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/","detectionMethod":"","ethnicity":{"id":"cg:HispanicOrLatino"},"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"Autism spectrum disorder, moderate intellectual disability, mild psychosis, aggressive behavior, functional language impairment","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0002342","obo:HP_0000729"],"previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"fragile X testing and molecular karyotype with normal results","secondTestingMethod":"PCR","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0c69cd79-1a17-4f84-9a71-b8146fd583b1_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25969726","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/27c2496b-75e1-4da3-96ce-518d0ae19fef","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001270458.1(MAOA):c.1039-2A>G (p.=)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA413010756"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"}}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNullCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/34187321-e7d0-4f22-8c40-c870cdd927cb_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0e064db6-a359-4f10-82a6-b41680dceec0","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8211186","rdfs:label":"proband_Brunner1993","ageType":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/","ageUnit":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/","detectionMethod":"X-chromosome linkage analysis. 26 polymorphisms tested.
