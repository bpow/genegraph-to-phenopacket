At least one homozygous missense variant has been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, expression data, biochemical function data, and a null mouse model. Of note, this gene has also been implicated in autosomal dominant nonsyndromic hearing loss. This has been assessed separately. Summary of Case Level Data: 3 POINTS. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 1 proband in 1 publication and segregated with disease in 5 additional family members (Jaworek et al., PMID: 24039609). This gene-disease association is supported by expression studies, biochemical function data, and a null mouse model (PMIDs: 31628468, 24039609). In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the Hearing Loss GCEP on 5.4.2017. It was reevaluated on 11.17.21 (SOP v 8). Although a new animal model was published (PMID: 31628468), the classification did not change. \n\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3e930bce-6a21-4803-a636-5fb083dd2dc7","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/95f5efe3-e0d1-4cef-b475-7ff1cd3c417c","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","changes":[{"id":"cg:newEvidence"},{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"},{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},{"id":"cg:sopChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/95f5efe3-e0d1-4cef-b475-7ff1cd3c417c_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2021-11-17T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/95f5efe3-e0d1-4cef-b475-7ff1cd3c417c_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2021-12-31T19:26:59.559Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/95f5efe3-e0d1-4cef-b475-7ff1cd3c417c_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/95f5efe3-e0d1-4cef-b475-7ff1cd3c417c_seg_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e2984e57-29a7-447f-85ea-36fd65d1a7bf_proband_segregation","type":"FamilyCosegregation","dc:description":"2 segregation points awarded for LOD.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24039609","rdfs:label":"PKDF468","family":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e2984e57-29a7-447f-85ea-36fd65d1a7bf","type":"Family","rdfs:label":"PKDF468","member":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b6240b8d-5a93-410a-8d2f-6d8134bfc16a","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24039609","rdfs:label":"V:2","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/48045a62-4917-44f8-ae66-bd6f749473a9","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001135022.2(ELMOD3):c.794T>C (p.Leu265Ser)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/65464"}},"detectionMethod":"Genome-wide linkage and sequencing of 4 candidate genes in the linkage region found no causative variants.
