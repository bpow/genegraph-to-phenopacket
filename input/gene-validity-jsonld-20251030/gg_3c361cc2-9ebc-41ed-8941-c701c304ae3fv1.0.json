At least 32 unique variants, including missense, nonsense, splice, frameshift, and indels have been reported in humans (Delague et al., 2007; PMID:17564959, Stendel et al., 2007; PMID:17564972, databases the Inherited Neuropathy Variant Database, LOVD, and HGMD) This gene-disease relationship is supported by expression studies and animal models. Investigation determined that FGD4 is ubiquitously expressed in human tissue, and was found to have the highest levels of expression in mouse nerve tissue during the embryonic stage. Additionally, mice with a disruption of FGD4 were found to have dysmyelination in early nerve development and additional myelin abnormalities at later stages of development. Frabin is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for CDC42, and deleting Fdg4 or Cdc42 in Schwann cells results in a similar defect in myelination, showing that these two genes have an essential function in myelinating Schwann cells. In transfected cells, C-terminal truncations of frabin result in fewer microspikes, which could be a biological assay for investigating FDG4 variants.  In summary, FGD4 is DEFINITIVELY  associated with autosomal recessive Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3c361cc2-9ebc-41ed-8941-c701c304ae3f","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e0aae8cd-9d57-4d8c-83ae-ed968cf186bc","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e0aae8cd-9d57-4d8c-83ae-ed968cf186bc_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10063","date":"2020-04-14T13:18:22.010Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e0aae8cd-9d57-4d8c-83ae-ed968cf186bc_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10063","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e0aae8cd-9d57-4d8c-83ae-ed968cf186bc_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/eb812618-e161-4506-87fe-e1c0869fadb3_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3ab472b5-c396-4e3b-9205-529e0004bf09","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19332693","rdfs:label":"Fabrizi_20yo_Proband","ageType":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/","ageUnit":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/","detectionMethod":"Direct sequencing of coding exons and exon-intron boundaries of FGD4, transcriptional analysis of leukocyte total RNA showed inclusion of a singleton G into the 5' end of exon 15 which caused a frameshift and premature stop codon at amino acid position 608 (p.Tyr587fsX14); parents confirmed heterozygous and to have both WT and mutant cDNA species by transcriptional analysis","firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"walked with support at 17mo, had surgery for nonparalytic strabismus at 6yo, retraction of Achilles tendon, stepping gait impossible on heels and difficult on toes, closed eye ataxia, atrophy and weakness of intrinsic foot muscles (MRC= 3), absent dorsiflexion of left big toe, weakness of anterior-tibial and peroneal muscles (MRC = 4), mild loss of deep and superficial sensations in feet and ankles, CMT neuropathy score = 17, left convex T8-L4 scoliosis and right convex dorsal T3-T8 scoliosis at 13yo, had bilateral Achilles elongation and transposition of peroneal tendon at 15yo, weakness of feet dorsiflexion (MRC = 4), mild hypertrophy of hypothenar and thenar eminences, Cranial nerves normal, electroneurography at 11 and 20yo showed marked slow nerve conduction velocities and prolonged distal latencies (Table 1).\n\nLight microscopy of left sural nerve biopsy showed decreased density of large myelinated fibers and frequent onion bulbs.

Severely reduced motor nerve conduction velocities at the median and cubital nerves, as well as low amplitude action potentials with prolonged distal latencies, indicated a peripheral nerve demyelinating process. A histological study of a sural nerve biopsy specimen was done in Lebanese patient 500.14 and showed a severe loss of myelinated fibres, probably secondary to a demyelination–remyelination process (fig 2). The remaining fibres had features of congenital hypomyelination as well as a small proportion of typical onion bulbs.

No cranial nerve abnormalities were noted. Dysmorphic features such as scoliosis and a short neck were present. Progression was slow until the age of 15. Electrophysiological results showed a severe demyelinating motor and sensory neuropathy, with similar results to family 500.
