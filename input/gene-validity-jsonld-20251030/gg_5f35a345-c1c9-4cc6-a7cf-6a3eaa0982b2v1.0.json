The phenotype associated with this disease is currently emerging in the literature and patients with this disease have been reported with immunological defects, including B-cell lymphocytopenia, hypogammaglobulinemia, and neutrophil functional abnormalities, and increased susceptibility to infection. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found differences in the molecular mechanisms, inheritance pattern, and/or phenotypic variability. Therefore, the following disease entities have been split into multiple disease entities, autosomal dominant neutrophil immunodeficiency syndrome (i.e., autosomal dominant immunodeficiency 73a with defective neutrophil chemotaxis and lymphopenia; OMIM: # 608203), autosomal dominant immunodeficiency 73b with defective neutrophil chemotaxis and lymphopenia (OMIM: # 618986), and autosomal recessive immunodeficiency 73c with defective neutrophil chemotaxis and hypogammaglobulinemia (OMIM: # 618987). The split curations for autosomal dominant immunodeficiency 73A with defective neutrophil chemotaxis and leukocytosis \nand autosomal dominant immunodeficiency 73b with defective neutrophil chemotaxis and lymphopenia have been curated separately. Two variants (both nonsense) that have been reported in 2 unrelated probands in 2 publications (PMIDs: 25512081, 31130284) are included in this curation. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss of function. This gene-disease association is also supported by RAC2 expression being specific to hematopoietic cells and demonstrated roles for RAC2 in regulation of B cell survival and proliferation and neutrophil effector functions, including chemotaxis and phagocytosis (PMID: 2189110, 14564009, 14564011, 23875749). Neutrophils from a patient homozygous for a loss-of-function RAC2 variant displayed defects in chemotaxis and cytoplasmic granule abnormalities (PMID: 25512081). A RAC2-/- mouse model and Zebrafish larvae model recapitulated several aspects of human disease; specifically, the mouse model presented with hypogammaglobulinemia and increased susceptibility to infection and the Zebrafish model with defects in neutrophil migration/chemotaxis and increased susceptibility to infection (PMID: 11907095, 25512081, 29897791).  In summary, there is moderate evidence to the relationship between RAC2 and autosomal recessive immunodeficiency 73c with defective neutrophil chemotaxis and hypogammaglobulinemia. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5f35a345-c1c9-4cc6-a7cf-6a3eaa0982b2","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8191c879-cc6a-4c5e-9ceb-7101aa7cbc15","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8191c879-cc6a-4c5e-9ceb-7101aa7cbc15_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10080","date":"2021-11-28T02:55:16.939Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8191c879-cc6a-4c5e-9ceb-7101aa7cbc15_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10080","date":"2021-10-19T15:46:13.500Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8191c879-cc6a-4c5e-9ceb-7101aa7cbc15_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8191c879-cc6a-4c5e-9ceb-7101aa7cbc15_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/186d17be-3bc0-4e6c-aa98-f0e39ebc6de1","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"While this mouse model recapitulates an important aspect of disease associated with RAC2 loss of function in humans, increased susceptibility to disease, only one aspect of human disease was investigated here.
