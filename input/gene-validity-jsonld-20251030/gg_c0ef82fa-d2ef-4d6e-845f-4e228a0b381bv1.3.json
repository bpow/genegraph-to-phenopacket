Additionally, experimental evidence showed that *AVPR1A* is possibly involved in social behaviors, including affiliation and attachment (PMID: 24924430). However, these association studies were underpowered—sequencing more individuals may have identified variants of functional significance. In two studies, transmission disequilibrium between *AVPR1A* microsatellites and autism were found but most were not statistically significant (PMID: 12082568, 16520824). In another study, investigators screened *AVPR1A* exons in 125 independent autistic probands (PMID: 15098001). However, the study did not demonstrate a disease-causing variant in the coding sequence, and the authors noted that differences in *AVPR1A* at the amino-acid level are unlikely to confer genetic vulnerability to autism. Experimental evidence is available, but, in the absence of human genetic evidence, such data were not utilized in the scoring. In summary, there is no valid genetic evidence to support an association between *AVPR1A* and autism spectrum disorder.
