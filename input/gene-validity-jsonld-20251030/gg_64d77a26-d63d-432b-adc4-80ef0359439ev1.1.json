LGMDR21 is typically characterized by young-adult onset of slowly progressive proximal upper and lower limb muscle weakness and atrophy. Additional phenotypes such as scapular winging, calf pseudohypertrophy, and contractures have been reported. A unique feature of \"inside to outside\" fatty degeneration has been observed in muscle biopsy in reported probands.  \n\nPer criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found a difference in inheritance pattern and phenotypic variability. Therefore, the following disease entities have been split into two separate disease entities for autosomal recessive limb-gridle muscular dystrophy-21 (OMIM: 617232) and dominant Dowling-Degos disease 4 (OMIM: 615696). \nEvidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level, segregation, and experimental data. \n\nSummary of Case Level Data: 10.8 POINTS. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 9 probands in 2 publications (PMIDs: 31897643, 27807076). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 1 additional family members in Family 1 (PMID: 31897643). Primary mechanism of disease associated is loss of function as reported in the literature (PMID: 27807076).\n\nSummary of Experimental Data: 1 POINT. This gene-disease association is also supported by functional alteration in non-human cells (PMID: 29634421). A model constructed using C2C12 cultured mouse myoblasts demonstrated that POGLUT1 knockdown reduced Notch signaling, affecting key regulators of myogenic differentiation, including PAX7 decrease and MYOD increase. The perturbed Pax7/MyoD expression balance led to a premature myogenic differentiation and an increase in myotube size. This finding was pronounced in in response to strong POGLUT1 downexpression. Considering the proposed disease mechanism for LGMD is biallelic loss-of-function leading to reduced Notch signalling that affects skeletal muscle formation and regeneration, the functional alteration evidence seems to support the gene-disease relationship. \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between POGLUT1 and autosomal recessive limb-girdle muscular dystrophy-21. This has been repeatedly\ndemonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy GCEP on the meeting date of February 8th, 2022 (SOP Version 9).\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/64d77a26-d63d-432b-adc4-80ef0359439e","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c3396945-a664-4ada-bb7f-c123ec50b849","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":{"id":"cg:expertPanelChange"},"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c3396945-a664-4ada-bb7f-c123ec50b849_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10151","date":"2024-08-14T19:23:24.665Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c3396945-a664-4ada-bb7f-c123ec50b849_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10151","date":"2024-08-14T19:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["ErrorClarification"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c3396945-a664-4ada-bb7f-c123ec50b849_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c3396945-a664-4ada-bb7f-c123ec50b849_seg_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3c70eeff-6e5e-41bd-ba9e-284945fb72e1_proband_segregation","type":"FamilyCosegregation","dc:description":"Enough

KO1 had four stable clone lines each with 53-81% downregulation of POGLUT1, while KO2 had six with a smaller downregulation of 19-42%. Two clones that displayed the strongest downregulation (Pg-KD1 at 82%) and a moderated (Pg-KD2 at 42%). A separate knockdown of POFUT1 confirmed no effect on POGLUT1 expression and vice versa with all downexpressions confirmed at the protein level. In order to judge phenotypic consequences of the knockdowns, fluorescence microscopy showed earlier apparition of thicker and longer branched myotubes in Pg-KD1 compared to controls with agglomerated nuclei. Pg-KD2 showed similar differentiation, but closer to WT and much shorter. This demonstrates that the downregulation affects earlier fusion and decreases cell proliferation with the number of mononucleated cells. The myotube phenotypes were also affected dependent on the level of POGLUT1 downregulation, with much higher fusion being allowed in the Pg-KD1 and 2 lines than in WT controls. This suggests a defective regulation mechanism of myoblast fusion and resulting runaway phenotypes. Given that these abnormal phenotypes could result from alteration of the Notch signalling pathway, western blot for the active form of the Notch receptor showed strong detection in WT myoblasts but consistently lowered levels by 50-95% in the two downregulated lines. Downexpression of several other genes integral to Notch signalling, such as RBPJ, HES1, and HEY1, were also observed suggesting altered cell growth arrest functions and a mechansim for the observed early differentiation. Finally, the PAX7/MYOD expression balance was significantly reduced in the Pg-KD cell lines compared to the WT. This indicates a drastic decrease in reserve cell maintenance in combination with the premature and increased differentiation.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29634421","rdfs:label":"POGLUT1 Downregulation Affects Myotube Formation"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":8819,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria9","strengthScore":11.8,"subject":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/SWMJ2_LmwQI","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0015152","gene":"hgnc:22954","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.1","websiteLegacyID":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/assertion_c3396945-a664-4ada-bb7f-c123ec50b849-","@context":{"@vocab":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"},"curationReasons":{"@type":"@vocab","@container":"@set"},"GCISnapshot":{"@type":"@id"},"dc:isVersionOf":{"@type":"@id"},"websiteLegacyID":{"@type":"@id"}}}
