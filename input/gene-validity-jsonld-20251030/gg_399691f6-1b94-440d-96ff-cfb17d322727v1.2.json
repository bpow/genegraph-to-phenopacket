The classical presentation of ARC includes congenital joint contractures, renal tubular dysfunction, and cholestasis. Additional features include ichthyosis, central nervous system malformation, platelet anomalies, and severe failure to thrive. At least 13 unique variants (mostly nonsense but also frameshift, splicing, start loss, and missense) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 9 probands in 4 publications (PMIDs: 20190753, 22753090, 23002115, 23636179). This gene-disease relationship is supported by its interaction with VPS33B (PMID: 20190753) and their function as part of a complex that interacts with an active form of RAB11A involved in apical membrane protein sorting, the alteration in mIMCD-3 cells confirming the role of VIPAS39 in regulating apical-basolateral polarity in the kidney consistent with the renal dysfunction seen in patients (PMID: 20190753), a zebrafish model recapitulating biliary abnormalities (PMID: 20190753), and a mouse model with collagen abnormalities identified in skin fibroblasts and tendons consistent with the characteristic ARC features of ichthyosis, arthrogryposis, osteopenia and bone fractures (PMID: 27435297). In summary VIPAS39 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive arthrogryposis, renal dysfunction, and cholestasis 2.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/399691f6-1b94-440d-96ff-cfb17d322727","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b87d2443-a34d-41b1-8712-bcd346e3cf52","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b87d2443-a34d-41b1-8712-bcd346e3cf52_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2020-12-16T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b87d2443-a34d-41b1-8712-bcd346e3cf52_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2021-02-12T15:23:55.147Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b87d2443-a34d-41b1-8712-bcd346e3cf52_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b87d2443-a34d-41b1-8712-bcd346e3cf52_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/691fa111-8873-4309-9cda-6e3b9df46f9b","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"VIPAS39 is expressed with low tissue specificity according to The Human Protein Atlas and the immunoblotting reported here.","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/187c8800-cd12-450e-af41-f1e9905ccc53","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Using a polyclonal mouse anti-VPS16B the authors determined the presence of VIPAS39 in various human tissues as well as MKs and platelets via immunoblotting.
