Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. At least 29 unique variants (mostly missense, but also nonsense, splice site, and frameshifts) have been reported in this gene in at least 29 probands in 11 publications (PMIDs: 18849486, 24344610, 27479822, 27905099, 30854628, 31565851, 28983057, 31064749, 32757236, 33217855, 32892537). Variants segregated with disease in an additional 20 family members. This gene-disease relationship is supported by restricted expression of β1 tubulin in platelets and megakaryocytes, where it appears late in differentiation and localizes to microtubule shafts and coils within proplatelets (PMID: 10942379), functional alteration in both patient and non-patient cells in which variant TUBB1 caused impaired megakaryocyte fragmentation and diminished proplatelet generation (PMIDs: 18849486, 30854628), and three model systems in cell culture (PMID: 24344610), mouse (PMID: 24344610), and canine (PMID: 18466252) with recapitulation of human disease. In summary TUBB1 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant macrothrombocytopenia. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4f8193d1-dd46-4741-8202-574e14bded9d","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/dbf068c4-8e07-4861-8eee-8e7d9572b122","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/dbf068c4-8e07-4861-8eee-8e7d9572b122_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2019-10-23T04:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/dbf068c4-8e07-4861-8eee-8e7d9572b122_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2022-10-10T17:01:08.783Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/dbf068c4-8e07-4861-8eee-8e7d9572b122_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/dbf068c4-8e07-4861-8eee-8e7d9572b122_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/29ba3e25-1327-48ce-932a-79ca42e63d9c","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The expression of β1 tubulin is restricted to platelets and megakaryocytes, where it appears late in differentiation and localizes to microtubule shafts and coils within proplatelets.

Furthermore, immunohistochemistry on bone marrow and spleen from normal adult mice showed the β1 tubulin protein to be remarkably confined to megakaryocytes. Significantly, only large cells morphologically identifiable as mature megakaryocytes showed detectable levels of β1 tubulin; immature megakaryocytes expressed little, if any, β1 tubulin. In cultures of wild-type hematopoietic cells, β1 tubulin expression was restricted to cells producing proplatelets.  The β1 tubulin mRNA level in proplatelet-producing colonies was approximately 10-fold higher than in those without proplatelets.  A microtubule ring was consistently present at the termini of individual proplatelet filaments, and β1 tubulin localized to this structure, which was similar to the marginal band of blood-derived platelets.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10942379","rdfs:label":"Platelet/Megakaryocyte Expression","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/dbf068c4-8e07-4861-8eee-8e7d9572b122_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/af04b1e7-f995-422c-be6d-aac04cfe4468","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d7e27c77-ddbe-42e3-b933-290c9c5df65e","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Cultured megakaryocytes with lentiviral suppression of endogenous mouse TUBB1 were rescued with lentivirus expressing wild-type or variant human TUBB1.
