The gene is located within a 16 million base pair region (11q23.3-24.3) identified by linkage analysis in a large Chinese family with LQTS (PMID 20560207). The Gly387Arg variant identified in this family, however, is now recognized to be present in 1/200 individuals of East Asian descent, making it very unlikely to be a rare cause of a rare disease. Because there is very little other data supporting the association of KCNJ5 with LQTS, the level of evidence for this gene-disease association was classified as disputed. \nNote: All LQTS genes were curated by 3 separate blinded teams. The evidence and scores reached by these 3 teams were reviewed by the LQTS Clinical Domain Expert Panel.
