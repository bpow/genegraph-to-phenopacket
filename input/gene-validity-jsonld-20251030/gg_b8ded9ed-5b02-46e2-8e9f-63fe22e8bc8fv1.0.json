(1997). Multiple case level studies have been performed with RCCP patients that have variants in the MET gene. Since gain of function is the disease mechanism, all pathogenic variants reported so far are missense variants. MET expresses in hepatocytes, epithelial cells and kidney. MET mutants exhibit increased levels of tyrosine phosphorylation and enhanced kinase activity in cell assays. Mutant MET molecules form foci in vitro and are tumorigenic in nude mice. Multiple MET knock-in in vivo mouse models of the kinase domain mutations have been established to show consistent phenotypes of tumorigenesis with RCCP patients. All of these types of evidence are consistent with a definitive relationship between the MET gene and papillary renal cell carcinoma.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b8ded9ed-5b02-46e2-8e9f-63fe22e8bc8f","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a71d9990-7202-487a-b7a3-4e659e0be73c","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a71d9990-7202-487a-b7a3-4e659e0be73c_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10023","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a71d9990-7202-487a-b7a3-4e659e0be73c_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10023","date":"2018-10-11T18:47:45.818Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a71d9990-7202-487a-b7a3-4e659e0be73c_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a71d9990-7202-487a-b7a3-4e659e0be73c_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9fcaff95-9cfa-4e6a-a087-74d1ced34096","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Decrease points because they observed slowly progressive hepatocarcinogenesis in adult liver, but not study on kidney.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/275eb146-14ba-48e5-b2ee-e885bc3fc364","type":"Finding","dc:description":"A mouse model of sporadic tumorigenesis in which they targeted the activated human MET oncogene to adult liver.
