At least 27 unique variants (missense, in-frame indel, nonsense, frameshift, large deletion, splice) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level and experimental data.\n\nVariants in this gene have been reported in at least 15 probands, in at least 6 publications (PMID:9354668, PMID:7659163, PMID: 7481768, PMID: 30032486, PMID: 14615376, PMID: 9753072). Probands described range in age of onset between approximately 3 and 14 months. Common phenotypes include recurrent upper and lower respiratory tract infections, decreased circulating antibody levels, recurrent diarrhea, lack of circulating T cells, and a normal number of B lymphocytes.\n\nThis gene-disease association is supported by mice models, cell culture models, expression studies, and in vitro functional assays (PMID: 28513593, PMID: 14615376, PMID: 10075926, PMID: 7481768). Protein encoded by JAK3 is a member of the Janus kinase (JAK) family of tyrosine kinases involved in cytokine receptor-mediated intracellular signal transduction. It is predominantly expressed in immune cells and transduces a signal in response to its activation via tyrosine phosphorylation by interleukin receptors. JAK3 mediates signaling events in both innate and adaptive immunity and plays a critical role in hematopoiesis during T-cells development (PMID: 14615376, PMID: 28513593). In the cytoplasm, JAK3 plays a crucial role in signal transduction via its association with type I receptors sharing the common gamma chain (γc) (PMID: 10075926). Following ligand binding to cell surface receptors, JAK3 phosphorylates specific tyrosine residues on the cytoplasmic tails of the receptor, creating docking sites for STATs proteins (PMID: 7481768). JAK3 phosphorylates the STATs proteins once they are recruited to the receptor. Phosphorylated STATs then translocate to the nucleus to activate gene transcription (UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot). Mutations in this gene are associated with autosomal recessive severe combined immunodeficiency and are found throughout all 7 functional domains of the protein with different functional effects.\n\nIn summary, JAK3 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive, severe combined immunodeficiency disease (T-negative/B-positive type). This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time\n\nThis classification was approved by the ClinGen SCID-CID Working Group on 12/17/20 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/164b4e7b-4ff5-416f-985d-c6e3cfe4675e","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/669dcacf-8423-4507-a36c-feab049737b3","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/669dcacf-8423-4507-a36c-feab049737b3_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10081","date":"2021-01-08T13:59:44.989Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/669dcacf-8423-4507-a36c-feab049737b3_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10081","date":"2020-12-18T20:05:20.841Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/669dcacf-8423-4507-a36c-feab049737b3_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/669dcacf-8423-4507-a36c-feab049737b3_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/188783ae-c238-46d5-8516-164461fc605e","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/90c6dfaf-b264-4b28-abac-e3faaabdd974","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Autophosphorylation of immunoprecipitated JAK3 from transfected cells was then assessed by in vitro kinase assay.

Lack of [γ-32P]ATP incorporation was likewise noted in JAK3 immunoprecipitates from COS-7 cells transfected with pME18s vector alone (Figure 4 upper panel, lanes 5 and 6), confirming the absence of detectable background kinase activity under these experimental conditions. In contrast to wild-type JAK3, none of the 3 patient-derived mutants exhibited detectable kinase activity in this experiment (Figure 4 upper panel, lanes 7-12). Reprobing of the membrane with anti-JAK3 antibody affirmed comparable loading of the different JAK3 constructs (Figure 4 lower panel, lanes 1-4 and 7-12) and lack of endogenous JAK3 expression by COS-7 cells (Figure 4 lower panel, lanes 5 and 6) in this experiment. Taken together, these data support the hypothesis that the abnormal JAK3 signaling displayed by del58A, D169E, and G589S mutant proteins was not simply due to limited expression of an otherwise normal JAK3 kinase.

Both mutations confirmed by Sanger sequencing in Pt4 and parents.","firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypeFreeText":"Patient was well until 4 months of age until presented with acute respiratory failure, without fever. Pt4 had history of long‐lasting cough and a growth arrest in the last month. The chest X‐ray performed revealed an interstitial pneumonia and an antibiotic therapy was started unsuccessfully.

Chimerism analysis did not reveal maternal T cells.","secondTestingMethod":"Next generation sequencing panels","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6af60dd9-866a-4c96-9ed8-0f2514d35efe_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30032486","allele":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d4c29403-94ce-457d-8223-a980f462c257","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000215.4(JAK3):c.1796T>G (p.Val599Gly)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA404769029"}},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d6d447f8-4c91-44ac-8fd9-7950c6178b17","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000215.4(JAK3):c.2125T>A (p.Trp709Arg)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA9301678"}}],"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"none"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a154e5f1-e88e-4571-8138-183142bf9bea_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Production of multiple JAK3 transcripts (due to exon skipping) was observed both in the patient and in her parents. Both the patient and her parents expressed a low-molecular-weight form of JAK3, in addition to a normal-sized one. Sequencing of genomic DNA revealed that the patient was homozygous for a C1839T nucleotide substitution in exon 12 of the JAK3 gene, resulting in an Arg5 77Trp amino acid substitution in the JH2 domain of the protein (referenced in PMID: 11668610 as NM_000215.4(JAK3):c.1744C>T (p.Arg582Trp)). This mutant form of JAK3 is expressed but is not tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to IL-2. Moreover, the internally deleted JAK3 protein, lacking 71 amino acids within the JH2 domain of JAK3, was tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to IL-2, yet it was unable to deliver downstream signaling events, as shown by lack of IL-2-induced STAT5 phosphorylation. \n\nAnalysis of IL-2-induced JAK3 phosphorylation showed that only the low-molecular-weight protein was marginally activated in the patient's cells, a reduced, but detectable, JAK3 phosphorylation was seen in BCLs from the parents. A normal IL-2-induced phosphorylation of STAT5B was detected in BCLs from the patient's parents, but not in BCLs from the patient. Similar results were obtained for IL-2 mediated STAT5A phosphorylation (data not shown).\n\n","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/96415763-2a3b-4215-9485-9081c0d9b3ca","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9753072","rdfs:label":"9-month-old girl","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":9,"detectionMethod":"The JAK3 transcript was amplified by RT-PCR on RNA prepared from lymphoblastoid cell lines. \nWestern-blot analysis revealed that, in addition to a normal-sized JAK3 protein, BCLs from the patient also equimolar amounts of a low-molecular weight form (Fig lA, lane 2), that was also detected in BCLs from the parents (lanes 3 and 4).
