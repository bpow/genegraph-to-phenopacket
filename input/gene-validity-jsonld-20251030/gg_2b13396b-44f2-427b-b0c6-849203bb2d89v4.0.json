Main characteristics are psychomotor delay including delayed myelination and myopathy (hypotonia, absent tendon reflexes etc.) from birth, with biochemical abnormalities of marked elevations in plasma SAH, SAM, methionine and creatine kinase accompanied by a significant decrease in the SAM/SAH ratio (however several cases had normal methionine levels at the initial evaluation). At least 13 variants (mostly missense but also nonsense) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Biallelic variants in this gene have been reported in at least 12 probands in 12 publications (PMIDs: 15024124, 16736098, 20852937, 22959829, 30121674, 26527160, 26095522, 27848944, 31957987, 35463910, 39512434, 39634240). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in three additional family members. This gene-disease relationship is supported by its biochemical function (PMID: 13641268). In summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged.\n\nThis gene-disease pair was previously evaluated by the Aminoacidopathy GCEP on 06/29/2020. It was reevaluated on 10/14/2022 with identification of one additional proband in PMID: 31957987. It was agin reevaluated on 12/6/2024 with identification of two additional probands and a C. elegans model in PMIDs: 39512434, 39634240, 38052822. As a result of this reevaluation, the classification moved from Moderate to Definitive.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2b13396b-44f2-427b-b0c6-849203bb2d89","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d9b3a56b-b188-44d1-9983-a059895c0ba1","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":[{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},{"id":"cg:classificationChange"},{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"},{"id":"cg:newEvidence"},{"id":"cg:sopChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d9b3a56b-b188-44d1-9983-a059895c0ba1_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10011","date":"2024-12-13T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d9b3a56b-b188-44d1-9983-a059895c0ba1_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10011","date":"2024-12-13T17:58:23.210Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["RecurationTiming","RecurationNewEvidence"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d9b3a56b-b188-44d1-9983-a059895c0ba1_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/788c32e5-57a0-48b9-8549-b2ecdbacef22_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/788c32e5-57a0-48b9-8549-b2ecdbacef22","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27848944","rdfs:label":"00080802","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":2,"allele":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/79b7760a-855c-4ff4-a22e-49d891888cb3","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000687.4(AHCY):c.266C>T (p.Ala89Val)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA9821065"}},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f2cb1aab-a178-4938-9443-a47386171005","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000687.4(AHCY):c.428A>G (p.Tyr143Cys)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA122806"}}],"detectionMethod":"WES with confirmation by conventional PCR amplification and Sanger sequencing.","firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0003235","obo:HP_0001324","obo:HP_0040081"],"sex":"Female","variant":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c0a9d02b-d48a-4ab2-8859-22ddb557e4b0_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27848944","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/79b7760a-855c-4ff4-a22e-49d891888cb3"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"}},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8c54f7dd-e801-497f-ae03-11b7d59b3477_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27848944","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f2cb1aab-a178-4938-9443-a47386171005"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"}}]},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c0a9d02b-d48a-4ab2-8859-22ddb557e4b0","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c0a9d02b-d48a-4ab2-8859-22ddb557e4b0_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c0a9d02b-d48a-4ab2-8859-22ddb557e4b0_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"The paternally inherited Ala89Val missense variant has been reported multiple times and was functionally characterized in PMID: 18211827.

A global DNA methylation analysis of the patients which, owing to lack of sufficient genomic DNA, were up to now only studied for imprinted gene methylation, would be necessary to further corroborate the hypothesis of fetal programming dependent on SAH levels present around implantation. In addition, the fact that only some patients with AHCY deficiency display DNA hypermethylation and these patients are even not all affected at the global or gene-specific level may reflect the involvement of the AHCY protein in a multitude of cellular pathways and complex protein interaction networks including more than 200 SAM-dependent MTs and thereby adjusting the metabolic machinery of the cell and individual.
