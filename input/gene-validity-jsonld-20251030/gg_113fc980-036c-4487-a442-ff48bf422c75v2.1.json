Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) is involved in somatic hypermutation (SHM), gene conversion, and class-switch recombination (CSR) in B-lymphocytes by deaminating C to U during transcription of Ig-variable and Ig-switch region DNA. AID-deficient patients are prone to infections and lymphoid hyperplasia related to giant germinal centers (PMID: 14962793). Additionally, patients with HIGM2 are prone to develop autoimmune diseases; B cells from AID-deficient patients express an abnormal Ig repertoire and high frequencies of autoreactive antibodies, demonstrating that AID is required for the establishment of both central and peripheral B-cell tolerance (PMID: 21700883). The mechanism for disease is biallelic loss of function (Muramatsu et al, PMID: 10373455). Of note, *AICDA* is also related to autosomal dominant HIGM. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found difference in molecular mechanisms (biallelic loss of function vs. monoallelic dominant negative), inheritance pattern (recessive vs. dominant)  and phenotypic variability (autoimmune disease has only been reported in the recessive form). Therefore, the disease entities have been split and autosomal dominant HIGM has been curated separately.\n\nAt least 41 unique variants (i.e. missense, in-frame indel, nonsense, frameshift, large deletion, etc.) have been reported in 110 cases of autosomal recessive HIGM (Reviewed in PMID: 22992148). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case level and experimental data. Variants in this gene reported in 13 probands in three publications (PMIDs: 11007475, 14962793 and 11112359) have been included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. This gene-disease relationship is supported by animal models (PMIDs: 10373455, 25252954) that recapitulate disease, expression studies (PMIDs: 10373455, 10950930) showing expression specifically in B cells of lymphoid tissues, biochemical function studies (PMID: 12692563), and functional alteration experiments showing defective CSR (PMID: 16964591). In summary, *AICDA* is definitively associated with autosomal recessive Hyper-IgM syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been held up over time.

When investigated whether AID mRNAs are induced in splenic B cells by reagents shown to activate B cells and induce CSR, AID mRNAs were strongly upregulated. An immunization with SRBC is known to initiate immunological responses, followed by clonal expansion and germinal center formation, in which CSR and affinity maturation take place. Poly(A)+ RNA was extracted from spleens of mice immunized with SRBC and subjected to Northern blot hybridization (Fig. 7A). AID mRNA expression was barely detectable in spleens without immunization, and significant up-regulation (3–5-fold induction) was demonstrated 5 and 13 days after immunization. To determine which cells express AID mRNAs in immunized spleen, RT-PCR was performed using fractionated splenic cells. Fig. 7B shows that AID mRNAs were observed in the non-T and CD191 cell fractions, indicating that SRBC immunization induced AID mRNA expression in CD19+ splenic B cells.\n\nBecause the timing of AID mRNA up-regulation in the spleen was roughly synchronous with the onset of GC formation after immunization (Fig. 7A), we next investigated the precise localization of AID mRNAs in lymphoid organs using in situ hybridization. When the antisense AID cRNA was used, distinct focal signals were seen in spleen sections from mice immunized with SRBC for 5 days (Fig. 8, E and H). By contrast, no signals were detected in unimmunized spleen sections with the same probe, in agreement with the data obtained by Northern blot hybridization (Fig. 7A). Peanut agglutinin staining of serial sections (Fig. 8, C, F, and I) showed that both Peyer’s patches and immunized spleens contained GC, and that signals derived from the antisense probe colocalized with GC (Fig. 8, E and H). On the other hand, regardless of immunization, the sense probe produced almost no signal in spleens or Peyer’s patches (Fig. 8, A, D, and G). GCs were rarely observed in spleens from  unimmunized mice (Fig. 8C). Taken together, these data demonstrate that AID mRNAs are specifically induced in GCs, which contain mostly activated B cells after encounter with antigens.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10373455","rdfs:label":"Miramatsu ","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/258fab6b-4b09-4e56-b333-50001b2b9aa2","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7cb46667-b2b4-4eda-a343-e78692be46d3","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Immunoglobulins are assembled by recombination and then are required to undergo, after antigen-dependent activation, class switch recombination (CSR) and somatic hypermutation.
