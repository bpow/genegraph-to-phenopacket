C1GALT1C1 (also known as COSMC) is a highly evolutionary conserved gene mapped to chromosome Xq24 (Hadar et al., PMID: 36599939). It is a molecular chaperone required for the proper folding and full activity of T synthase, the enzyme that initiates complex O-glycans biosynthesis (Erger et al., PMID: 37216524). In humans, somatic loss-of-function variants in C1GALT1C1 have been associated with Tn polyagglutination syndrome. Two recent reports, including a de novo hemizygous missense mutation and a hemizygous germline loss of function variant have been reported to cause AHUS8 (Hadar et al., PMID: 36599939; Erger et al., PMID: 37216524). The term COSMC-CDG has been suggested (Erger et al., PMID: 37216524). Common symptoms among the reported cases include a combination of thrombocytopenia, immune deficiency, developmental delay, short stature with short limbs, facial dysmorphisms and variable-onset acute kidney injury resembling aHU in hemizygous males. Females exhibit less pronounced clinical phenotypes in line with X-linked semidominant inheritance. Treatment with C5 inhibitors results in improvement of renal function (Hadar et al., PMID: 36599939; Erger et al., PMID: 37216524). This gene-disease relationship is supported by relevant experimental evidence, including an animal model (Wang et al., PMID:20439703) and expression studies (Hadar et al., PMID: 36599939; Erger et al., PMID: 37216524). Currently, the biological evidence is clear but more clinical evidence is necessary. In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the ClinGen ClinGen Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation GCEP on January 2, 2025 (SOP Version 11).","C1GALT1C1 was first reported in relation to x-linked atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome 8 with rhizomelic short stature (AHUS8) in 2023 (Hadar et al., PMID: 36599939; Erger et al., PMID: 37216524).

Mice with a partial C1galt1 knock-out developed severe proteinuric kidney disease with glomerular loss in renal histology, as do mice with podocyte-specific knockout of C1galt1c1. Altered expression of C1GALT1 and/orC1GALT1C1 is linked to IgA nephropathy (IgAN) in humans, in which Tn-antigen is enriched among the O-glycans of IgA1, which is termed galactose-deficient IgA1 (Gd-IgA1). In IgAN, the autoantigenic Gd-IgA1 forms macromolecular circulating immune complexes (CICs), some of which are deposited into the glomerular mesangium over time, where they promote an inflammatory response. In humans, somatic loss-of-function variants in C1GALT1C1affecting cells in the hematopoietic system can cause Tn syndrome, a rare and usually subclinical disorder presenting with mild hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia and leukopenia associated with Tn-antigen accumulation on a subset of blood cells. Exposure of the abnormal Tn-antigen likely leads to an autoantibody-mediated cytotoxic immune response.
