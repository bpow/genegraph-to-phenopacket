Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data. At least one missense variant that affects mRNA splicing has been reported in a consanguineous family where it segregated with disease in three affected family members (PMID: 34214472). They had severe human papillomavirus (HPV)-driven skin papillomatosis ranging from HPV-4-associated skin warts in two patients to HPV-2- associated ‘‘tree man syndrome’’ in one patient. Additional symptoms include increased levels of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) viremia, and a defect in mounting antibody responses to vaccines. Heterozygous carriers were unaffected. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss of function. This gene-disease relationship is supported by animal models, expression studies, in vitro functional assays, and rescue in patient cells. CD28 deficient mice are susceptible to MmuPV1 (Mouse papillomavirus type 1). Keratinocytes from affected patients have absent CD28 expression and their T-cells have no detectable p65 phosphorylation in response to CD28 or CD3/CD28 cross-linking. A lentiviral vector expressing the WT CD28 cDNA restored p65 phosphorylation in response to CD28 or CD3/CD28 cross-linking in patient T cells (PMID: 34214472). In summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged. This classification was approved by the ClinGen SCID-CID GCEP on the meeting date October 17, 2024 (SOP Version 11)].","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/43e8fa4f-48db-414b-88dd-7658c683300e","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/01ff1097-4da6-4dfb-be34-9161c65f986e","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/01ff1097-4da6-4dfb-be34-9161c65f986e_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10081","date":"2025-03-26T19:40:51.874Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/01ff1097-4da6-4dfb-be34-9161c65f986e_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10081","date":"2024-10-29T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/01ff1097-4da6-4dfb-be34-9161c65f986e_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/53c4b084-7894-4390-9821-dca21b1cc7da_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/478d6276-3a39-4fcd-bacc-3e4155344143","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1.0,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/478d6276-3a39-4fcd-bacc-3e4155344143_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"RT-PCR showed that CD28 mRNA levels were 50- to 200-fold lower in PHA-driven T cell blasts from the patients than in those of the controls, whereas the levels in heterozygous cells were half those in control cells (Figure 1F). The full-length product was detected in much smaller amounts by reverse transcription PCR in the patients’ cells than in cells from all other individuals tested (Figure S3A). \"We showed, by TA cloning of the reverse transcription PCR products from a control and P1, that all mRNAs in control T cells used the canonical splicing donor site of exon 1 (Figure 1G). Only 79% of CD28 transcripts in P1’s T cells used the canonical mRNA splicing donor site of exon 1 containing the missense nucleotide substitution (p.Gly18Arg) (Figure 1G). The remaining 21% of the transcripts used alternative donor splice sites corresponding to a truncated and frameshift transcript (referred to hereafter as p.Val16fs) or a transcript retaining the first nine nucleotides of intron 1 (referred to hereafter as I1- Ret).

PMA stimulation induced high levels of p-p65 in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from the patients, heterozygotes, and controls. CD3 stimulation alone weakly induced the production of p-p65 in both T cell subsets in all individuals. In the heterozygotes and healthy controls, stimulation via CD28 alone induced strong p65 phosphorylation in CD4+ T cells, and CD3/CD28 costimulation induced strong p65 phosphorylation in CD8+ T cells (Figure 2B). The patients’ CD4+ and CD8+ T cells displayed no detectable p65 phosphorylation following CD28 stimulation alone, and no increase in p65 phosphorylation following CD3/CD28 costimulation, relative to CD3 stimulation alone (Figure 2B). We used a lentiviral vector to express the WT CD28 cDNA in T cells PHA blasts from P1.
