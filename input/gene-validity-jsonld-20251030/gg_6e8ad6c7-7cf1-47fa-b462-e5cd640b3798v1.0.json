The DLAT gene encodes dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase, the E2 subunit of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC). PDC catalyzes conversion of pyruvate into acetyl-CoA, thus is the link between glycolysis and the citric acid cycle. PDC deficiency leads to impaired energy metabolism.\n\nThe DLAT gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Leigh syndrome spectrum in 2005 (PMID: 16049940). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included four variants identified in three cases in two publications (PMIDs: 16049940, 20022530). No segregation data were available. Loss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease association is also supported by biochemical function, expression data, and model systems (PMIDs: 27977873, 25613900, 30407599, 15070761). \n\nIn summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on July 13, 2020 (SOP Version 7).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6e8ad6c7-7cf1-47fa-b462-e5cd640b3798","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/78e45dbe-ea30-434d-9522-aa1731b9a764","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/78e45dbe-ea30-434d-9522-aa1731b9a764_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2021-01-14T21:21:09.553Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/78e45dbe-ea30-434d-9522-aa1731b9a764_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2021-01-14T21:20:56.234Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/78e45dbe-ea30-434d-9522-aa1731b9a764_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/78e45dbe-ea30-434d-9522-aa1731b9a764_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8b22c5f1-0423-448e-a982-021784c69600","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"This model does not recaptulate the phenotype observed in patients and points were awarded for embryonic lethality.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/871c4bd2-8af4-469e-a632-8d51c0f971b2","type":"Finding","dc:description":"The DLAT mouse model presents with preweaning lethality and complete penetrance.

This zebrafish model has two N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea induced mutations that disrupt retinal function (a13-stop gain and m631-missense allele). Other characteristics of noa include expanded melanophores, absence of feeding behavior, lethargy, and premature death. (1) Dlat protein levels are significantly reduced in mutant compared with WT. Shortened form of Dlat in the a13 allele was not detected, suggesting that the truncated protein is completely degraded. (2) Mutants showed a 16.1-fold increase in lactate and a 2.6-fold increase in pyruvate (Fig. 3 C and D) indicative of PDH deficiency. ATP and ADP levels and ratios were normal in mutants similar to humans with PDH deficiency. (3) At 8dpf, histological examination of mutants show no brain abnormalities. On a ketogenic diet, at 21-40dpf, growth retardation was observed (mutants die 2-4 days after removing from diet). (4) Similar to patients with PDH deficiency, mutants showed reduced growth rate even on a ketogenic diet.\nThe zebrafish mutant noa model exhibits many disease characteristics similar to those of human patients with PDH deficiency.

By age 6 months, he had marked head lag and was generally floppy. He crawled at age 13 months, walked with knee-foot orthoses at age 14 months, and had said four single words at age 18 months. Examination at 4 years confirmed that he was ataxic with gross and fine motor delay. He had mild intermittent ptosis and an intermittent convergent squint with full abduction in each eye. He had pendular nystagmus and reduced, abnormal eye movements. Eye movement studies confirmed saccade initiation failure (oculomotor apraxia). He drooled constantly and had dystonic movements of the facial muscles and of his hands and feet. Passive movements demonstrated variable tone in the limbs, mostly somewhat reduced. Tendon reflexes were brisk, with some recruitment in the upper limbs. He could say 12 words. \nUrinary organic acids and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amino acids and neurotransmitters also were normal.
