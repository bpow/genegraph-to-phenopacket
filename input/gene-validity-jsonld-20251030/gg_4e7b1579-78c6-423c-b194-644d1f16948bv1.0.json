The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss-of-function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence (expression data; PMID: 30377171, NCBI fetal expression). In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Congenital Heart Disease GCEP on the meeting date 7/8/2024 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4e7b1579-78c6-423c-b194-644d1f16948b","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c1987d75-7cdc-4d6f-9d71-f00b3bedf7c3","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c1987d75-7cdc-4d6f-9d71-f00b3bedf7c3_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10130","date":"2024-07-08T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c1987d75-7cdc-4d6f-9d71-f00b3bedf7c3_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10130","date":"2024-08-16T14:55:04.887Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c1987d75-7cdc-4d6f-9d71-f00b3bedf7c3_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c1987d75-7cdc-4d6f-9d71-f00b3bedf7c3_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/09318f6a-50f6-4b73-b9c5-15ba0d2ac29c","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Downgraded as injection of scrambled MO did not impact pitx2c expression in comparison to the non-injected control.
