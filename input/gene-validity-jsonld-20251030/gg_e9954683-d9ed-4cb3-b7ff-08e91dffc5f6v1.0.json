Typical phenotypes of these probands include infantile-onset focal seizures, which are often epilepsy of infancy with migrating focal seizures, global developmental delay, hypotonia, progressive microcephaly, delayed myelination and cerebral atrophy (PMIDs: 26333769, 27436767, and 31618474). Of note, there has been an assertion made for autosomal dominant susceptibility to idiopathic generalized epilepsy (OMIM:616685). Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found differences in inheritance pattern and phenotypic variability. The Epilepsy GCEP does not curate for disease susceptibility, so the information about epilepsy susceptibility will not be curated at this time. This entry will only cover autosomal recessive developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (MONDO:0100062).\n\nTen variants (missense, small in-frame deletions, and splicing) that have been reported in six probands in three publications (PMIDs: 26333769, 27436767, 31618474) are included in this curation. There is some preliminary evidence to suggest that the mechanism of pathogenicity may be loss of function. Electrophysiological studies showed reduced transporter activity of proteins with some variants, although few studies are available at this time (PMIDs: 26333769, 27436767). This gene-disease relationship is also supported by a knockout mouse model in which gentle handling or movement of the mother and littermates triggered seizures (PMID: 12000122). In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship.\n\nThis classification was approved by the ClinGen Epilepsy Gene Curation Expert Panel on March 7, 2023 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e9954683-d9ed-4cb3-b7ff-08e91dffc5f6","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/768a3318-a75d-412a-91e6-78d51609ac3e","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/768a3318-a75d-412a-91e6-78d51609ac3e_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10005","date":"2023-03-07T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/768a3318-a75d-412a-91e6-78d51609ac3e_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10005","date":"2023-03-31T13:01:04.575Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/768a3318-a75d-412a-91e6-78d51609ac3e_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/768a3318-a75d-412a-91e6-78d51609ac3e_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8176c443-1ee4-47d7-8012-f08137d26654","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/96e99794-b82d-4b47-a830-3adb765bd928","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Both mouse and humans had tonic clonic seizures shortly after birth.

The IGly amplitude varied linearly with the holding potential and reversed in polarity. Fitting the I–V relationship, cells transfected with both GlyR a2 and wild-type KCC2 yielded a more hyperpolarising ECl than cells solely expressing GlyR a2, consistent with Cl  extrusion by KCC2. KCC2 mutants, however, exhibited a depolarized ECl relative to wildtype KCC2. The estimated ECl for all three mutants was similar and did not differ significantly from that in cells solely expressing GlyR a2 and eGFP (Fig. 3c), consistent with passive equilibration of Cl  ions as predicted from the pipette and extracellular solutions. To further explore impaired mutant KCC2\nactivity, we measured the rate at which ECl recovers to a starting value after a period of chloride load, as described previously. Glycine was applied every 30 s while holding cells at  80 mV\nthen at þ 40 mV to load them with Cl. When the holding potential was reset to  80 mV, glycine-evoked currents were larger due to the increased driving force. In cells transduced with wild-type KCC2, glycine-evoked currents IGly returned to the initial amplitude consistent with transporter-mediated extrusion of chloride. The rate at which IGly amplitude recovered for the\nthree KCC2 mutants was much slower. The recovery rate in cells expressing L426P and G551D mutants was not significantly different from cells expressing only GlyR a2 and eGFP, consistent with near complete loss of KCC2 function.

The first panel consisted of 88 genes and final version 274 genes.","ethnicity":{"id":"cg:NotHispanicOrLatino"},"firstTestingMethod":"Next generation sequencing panels","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0000252","obo:HP_0032786","obo:HP_0033725","obo:HP_0012444","obo:HP_0006808"],"previousTesting":false,"sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/07316f57-abab-43ff-914a-b0834045babb_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31780880","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/884ac9e3-85ae-42ee-9aec-36e48bfe59b8"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"}}}},"phenotypeNegativeAlleleNegative":0,"phenotypePositiveAllelePositive":1,"phenotypes":["obo:HP_0012444","obo:HP_0006808","obo:HP_0033725","obo:HP_0032786","obo:HP_0000252"],"proband":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f9fb93a1-0eb6-4dcd-b98c-f38edf7b4206"}},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d95bf220-2dfd-480c-8cfa-090299f2c40c_proband_segregation","type":"FamilyCosegregation","dc:description":"Not enough affected individuals.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26333769","rdfs:label":"A","estimatedLodScore":0.6,"family":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d95bf220-2dfd-480c-8cfa-090299f2c40c","type":"Family","rdfs:label":"A","ethnicity":{"id":"cg:NotHispanicOrLatino"},"member":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cb4d4bd2-acf6-45c7-900c-3184c615df91"}},"meetsInclusionCriteria":false,"phenotypeNegativeAlleleNegative":0,"phenotypePositiveAllelePositive":2,"phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001263","obo:HP_0002059","obo:HP_0002376","obo:HP_0012448","obo:HP_0002353","obo:HP_0005484","obo:HP_0032786","obo:HP_0001252"],"proband":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cb4d4bd2-acf6-45c7-900c-3184c615df91"}},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8caa103d-4917-4706-947d-211a23bfd34c_proband_segregation","type":"FamilyCosegregation","dc:description":"Not enough affected individuals","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26333769","rdfs:label":"B","estimatedLodScore":0.6,"family":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8caa103d-4917-4706-947d-211a23bfd34c","type":"Family","rdfs:label":"B","ethnicity":{"id":"cg:NotHispanicOrLatino"},"member":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/846893ed-5654-4a22-836b-60354852e942"}},"meetsInclusionCriteria":false,"phenotypeNegativeAlleleNegative":0,"phenotypePositiveAllelePositive":2,"phenotypes":["obo:HP_0012448","obo:HP_0002376","obo:HP_0002353","obo:HP_0002059","obo:HP_0032786","obo:HP_0001252","obo:HP_0005484","obo:HP_0001263"],"proband":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/846893ed-5654-4a22-836b-60354852e942"}},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/49a937cc-12e5-4336-83f0-2340ca01f75a_proband_segregation","type":"FamilyCosegregation","dc:description":"Not enough affected individuals","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27436767","rdfs:label":"Saitsu1","estimatedLodScore":0.73,"family":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/49a937cc-12e5-4336-83f0-2340ca01f75a","type":"Family","rdfs:label":"Saitsu1","ethnicity":{"id":"cg:NotHispanicOrLatino"},"member":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7aeeb891-81b7-450f-b110-3ba9bdb079f4"}},"meetsInclusionCriteria":false,"phenotypeNegativeAlleleNegative":1,"phenotypePositiveAllelePositive":2,"phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001263","obo:HP_0032786","obo:HP_0001252","obo:HP_0002059","obo:HP_0033725","obo:HP_0012448","obo:HP_0002353","obo:HP_0000253"],"proband":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7aeeb891-81b7-450f-b110-3ba9bdb079f4"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValiditySegregationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f9fb93a1-0eb6-4dcd-b98c-f38edf7b4206_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/07316f57-abab-43ff-914a-b0834045babb","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Because this individual also had a heterozygous SCN1A variant (c.2785C>T/ p.L929F, not in gnomAD), we do not know whether the SCN1A variant contributed to the patient's phenotype.
