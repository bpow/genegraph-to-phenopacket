At least 7 unique variants (missense) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 7 probands in 6 publications (PMIDs: 8220422, 12136074, 20888934, 17376685, 28527222, 25960145). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. This gene-disease association is supported by knock-in mouse models, in vitro functional assays, and expression studies. In summary, RYR1 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant RYR1-related myopathy. Of note, this gene has also been implicated in autosomal recessive RYR1-related myopathy and autosomal dominant malignant hyperthermia susceptibility.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/63d17607-42c1-4cd1-9134-1187f3ac15fa","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fbd82373-705c-4b60-8b73-147ed461d357","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fbd82373-705c-4b60-8b73-147ed461d357_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10031","date":"2020-10-26T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fbd82373-705c-4b60-8b73-147ed461d357_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10031","date":"2020-11-06T19:14:47.705Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fbd82373-705c-4b60-8b73-147ed461d357_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fbd82373-705c-4b60-8b73-147ed461d357_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8a868fda-38ff-47f5-848a-20996928b18a","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/64ed0704-7b0d-45a9-a471-1df74633f9cc","type":"Finding","dc:description":"In CCD patients, cores are described as delimited regions of the muscle fiber in which overall ultrastructure is damaged and mitochondria are missing and/or nonfunctional.
