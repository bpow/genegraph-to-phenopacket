ASD disorders include iris hypoplasia, an enlarged or reduced corneal diameter, corneal vascularization and opacity, posterior embryotoxon, corectopia, polycoria, an abnormal iridocorneal angle, ectopia lentis, and anterior synechiae between the iris and posterior corneal surface. Individuals with *CPAMD8* variants are described with glaucoma and features of ASD or with isolated ASD, however, with a high degree of variability. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no differences in Anterior Segment Dysgenesis 8 (ASD8; OMIM: 617319) and Open-Angle Glaucoma (OMIM: 137750) associated with *CPAMD8*. Therefore these disease entities have been lumped into a single entity, *CPAMD8*-related anterior segment dysgenesis.\nSummary of Genetic Evidence: Eight missense, three nonsense, four frameshift, five splice-site and intronic, one in-frame insertion, two large deletion and duplication variants have been reported in 13 probands across three publications (PMIDs: 32085876, 32274568, 27839872). One large deletion was found in one proband in one publication (PMID: 32274568). The exon 23 deletion (c.2794_­­­­2845del) variant is reported in proband CG-ASD-ANI-0066 (PMID:32274568) was not scored in the GCI as the exact breakpoints are unknown; however the variant likely causes a frameshift and warrants 1.5 points. One large duplication spanning exons 8 to 13 reported in (PMID: 32085876).WaS too large to register in the ClinGen Allele Registry and; therefore, could not be scored in the GCI, but warrants 1.5 points. More evidence is available in the literature (PMID: 29556725), but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be biallelic loss of function. \nSummary of Experimental Evidence: This gene-disease association is also supported by animal models and expression studies (32274568, 27839872, 28683140). The expression study (PMID: 27839872) showed *CPAMD8* detected in the developing human lens and retina at week 9 of gestation into the second trimester. *CPAMD8* was also detected in the iris and cornea at week 22 of gestation. Zebrafish embryos replicated the corneal thickening and abnormal collagen deposition that were found in probands (PMID: 32274568). *CPAMD8* was detected in the epithelium of the ciliary body in fetal and adult cattle (PMID:28683140). In summary, *CPAMD8* is definitively associated with autosomal recessive anterior segment dysgenesis 8. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cafe6cf8-48ed-4401-a3d5-002f934bdff1","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bc4d2b2a-08d6-4869-a56e-55721fd4c9dc","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bc4d2b2a-08d6-4869-a56e-55721fd4c9dc_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10077","date":"2022-12-21T18:14:03.402Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bc4d2b2a-08d6-4869-a56e-55721fd4c9dc_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10077","date":"2022-11-18T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bc4d2b2a-08d6-4869-a56e-55721fd4c9dc_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2fdd6938-f865-4d0b-9acc-8c867678fdf6_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4c4442ad-7757-4304-9a6f-7cc391c67e95","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Homozygous for NM_015692.2:c.2449A>T (p.Lys817Ter), which is absent from gnomAD.
