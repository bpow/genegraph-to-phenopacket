In five families reported with HIIMS, females homozygous for *CDC14A* variants had prelingual sensorineural hearing loss, and homozygous males had hearing loss and infertility (PMID: 29293958). Three families segregated truncating variants predicted to affect all isoforms of the gene. Two families had two different missense variants in the dual-specificity phosphatase domain of *CDC14A*. One additional family had a third missense variant in this domain, but the fertility status of the affected males could not be determined. This gene-disease relationship is supported by expression studies and animal models (PMIDs: 27259055, 29293958). There are four mouse models for this syndrome, including one with a predicted deleterious missense variant in the phosphatase domain generated by CRISPR/Cas9 (PMID: 29293958). Of note, this gene has also been implicated in autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss which has been​ assessed separately. In summary, there is strong evidence to support the association between *CDC14A* and autosomal recessive hearing impairment and infertile male syndrome. Additional reports in humans are needed to reach a definitive classification. This gene-disease pair was originally classified as Strong by the ClinGen Hearing Loss​ Working Group on 2/26/2018 as per SOP v5. It was reevaluated on 6/1/2023. As of June 2023, this record underwent an update in scoring to be consistent with SOP v9. No new evidence has been reviewed or added. As a result of this reevaluation, the classification did not change. \n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f6c630ca-ca1a-4494-9352-1c2d87e7f9cc","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/144089d2-83ec-4c6c-8b43-9a4cae801d51","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Strong","changes":[{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"},{"id":"cg:sopChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/144089d2-83ec-4c6c-8b43-9a4cae801d51_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2023-06-01T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/144089d2-83ec-4c6c-8b43-9a4cae801d51_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2024-01-31T19:51:47.929Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["RecurationTiming"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/144089d2-83ec-4c6c-8b43-9a4cae801d51_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/144089d2-83ec-4c6c-8b43-9a4cae801d51_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d437b30c-53d0-469a-abd0-6bc133f50bba","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/69207eae-8aeb-4dd5-beca-cf25876a1a96","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Immunofluorescent labelling of CDC14A in mouse inner ear showed primary localization to kinocilia of  cochlear and vestibular hair cells at all stages analyzed.
