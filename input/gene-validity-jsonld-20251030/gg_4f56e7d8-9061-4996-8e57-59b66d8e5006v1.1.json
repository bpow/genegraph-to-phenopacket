Variants in this gene have also been reported in association with Stormorken Syndrome, York Platelet Syndrome, and an Immunodeficiency phenotype (PMIDs: 25577287, 24591628, 24619930). Stormorken and York Platelet have been evaluated by ClinGen Lumping and Splitting guidelines and determined to be the same entity as Tubular Aggregate Myopathy with a spectrum of phenotypic severity. At least 17 unique predominantly missense variants have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data.\nVariants in this gene have been reported in at least 24 probands in 10 publications (PMIDs: 23332920, 25326555, 25577287, 24591628, 24619930, 28624464, 27876257, 24570283, 25953320, 27066587). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in a number of additional family members, however no families were large enough to draw meaningful evidence. More genetic evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached.\nThe mechanism for disease is heterozygous gain of function, with alteration of particularly the EF-hand domain responsible for altered calcium signalling detection and resulting consitutive activation of store-operated calcium entry regardless of the intracellular calcium levels. (Morin et al. 2019, PMID: 31448844) This gene-disease association and mechanism is supported by several mouse and zebrafish models, biochemical function evidence, and functional studies. Each model recapitulates some amount of the phenotypes shown in humans including thrombocytopenia, muscle weakness, and muscle fiber atrophy. Additionally, STIM1's role in SOCE and the resulting always activated state when the expression and function of the protein is altered show clear correlations with the displayed phenotypes as both platelet function/clotting and skeletal muscle signalling relies on calcium flow. \nIn summary, STIM1 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant tubular aggregate myopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4f56e7d8-9061-4996-8e57-59b66d8e5006","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9419adda-b3fb-4c2d-8562-6a0318260bbd","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":{"id":"cg:sopChange"},"contributions":[{"agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","role":"SecondaryContributor"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9419adda-b3fb-4c2d-8562-6a0318260bbd_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10031","date":"2021-04-01T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9419adda-b3fb-4c2d-8562-6a0318260bbd_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10031","date":"2021-07-23T14:12:28.468Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9419adda-b3fb-4c2d-8562-6a0318260bbd_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9419adda-b3fb-4c2d-8562-6a0318260bbd_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/938129ec-7e89-4f8f-9efa-2d3edac5d76b","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Because the function of STIM1 as a key mediator of SOCE is integral to proper function of both platelets/clotting and muscle function, this evidence scores default points.","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fb60599b-9f76-497b-87df-5ad644d26bf5","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Proper calcium cignalling is integral to muscular function, specifically because intracellular increases in calcium allows for binding to troponin on actin filaments which triggers the contraction cascade in striated muscle.

Pairedend Illumina adapters (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA) were ligated to the fragments according to themanufacturer’s recommendations. Exome capture was performed with the SureSelect Human All Exon kit v2 (Agilent Technologies). The final amplified exome captured library was quantified using a Qubit Flourometer (Life Technologies) and qPCR using primers binding in adapter sequence and Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Life Technologies). Illumina PhiX control kit v2.0 DNA (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA) was used for standard curve generation. Fragment size distribution of the input library was measured using a 2100 Bioanalyzer and Agilent High Sensitivity DNA Chip (Agilent Technologies). The exome captured library was sequenced onanIlluminaHiSeq2000with 100 bp pairedend reads. Reads that did not pass Illumina’s standard filter were removed prior to alignment. Remaining reads were aligned to the reference human genome (GRCh37/hg19), using Burrows–Wheeler Aligner tool [Li and Durbin, 2009] (bio-bwa.sourceforge.net). PCR duplicates were removed. Approximately 90% of the reads mapped uniquely to the reference sequence yielding an average of \u000290x coverage per targeted base. Variant calling was performed using the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) [McKenna et al., 2010] (broadinstitute.org/gatk). Variants were annotated with SeattleSeq (snp.gs.washington.edu/SeattleSeqAnnotation) and ANNOVAR [Wang et al., 2010] (openbioinformatics.org/annovar). VCFtools (vcftools.sourceforge.net) were used to manipulate vcf files and The Integrative Genomic Viewer (broadinstitute.org/igv/) was used for data visualization. Pathogenicity prediction of the mutation was checked with SIFT [Ng and Henikoff, 2001] (sift.jcvi.org/) and PolyPhen-2 [Adzhubei et al., 2010] (genetics. bwh.harvard.edu/pph/). Sanger sequencing to verify the variant: Genomic DNA from the patients, their healthy relatives, and 257 healthy controls was used to generate PCR products with primers flanking the point mutation (STIM1ex7 F TGGAGCTGTCATTTTCCTCTTT and STIM1ex7 R GGCCTCCCAAAGTGCTAGAAT). PCR products were Sanger sequenced using an ABI 3730xl DNA analyzer and ABI BigDye dye terminator cycle-sequencing kits (Life Technologies). Sequences were analyzed with sequencing analysis and SeqScape software (Life Technologies). Sanger sequencing in all patients and available healthy relatives confirmed the segregation of the variant solely in the affected individuals.","firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"elevated calcium levels in platelets, reduced SOCE in platelets, incresed platelet P-selectin expression, increased platelet CD63 expression, increased platelet microparticles production","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0000601","obo:HP_0000448","obo:HP_0001746","obo:HP_0001324","obo:HP_0031133","obo:HP_0100876","obo:HP_0001873","obo:HP_0002901","obo:HP_0008064","obo:HP_0003236","obo:HP_0000616","obo:HP_0001297","obo:HP_0002315","obo:HP_0001892"],"previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"Clinical and laboratory examinations disclosed miosis, ichthyosis, anaemia, thrombocytopenia, thrombocytopathy, asplenia, myopathy, abnormal red cells with Howell-Jolly bodies.

Sequence alignment to the human genome (UCSC GRCh37/hg19) was performed with the Burrows- Wheeler Aligner (BWA v. 0.5.9-rc1) [6]. Sequence processing and variant calling were carried out by removing presumed PCR duplicates with the Picard’s MarkDuplicates utility (http://picard.sourceforge.net), followed by local realignment and recalibration of base quality scores using the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) v1.5-20 [7]. SNPs and INDELs were identified with the GATK Unified Genotyper [8]. Functional annotation of variants was performed by using snpEff v. 2.0.5d [9]. Variants were then filtered against available public (1,000 Genomes Project and dbSNP135) and in-house databases, whereas those located within segmental duplications and outside highly conserved regions in vertebrates were filtered using wAnnovar (http://wannovar. usc.edu). To prioritizing candidates, data and text mining analyses were performed using Genie and DAVID algorithms. Sequence validation and segregation analyses for all the candidate variants as well as coding sequence and intron– exon boundaries of the entire STIM1 (exons 1–12) (NM_003156) was performed by Sanger sequencing using standard techniques.","firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001371","obo:HP_0001324","obo:HP_0003236"],"secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/169c511d-d017-450d-8f00-f8880bd14bca_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24570283","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/494dd617-9696-455e-879e-05f53cc1637d"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:DeNovoAlleleOrigin"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADDeNovoCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a739186a-a1bb-4fbe-9d2d-6451baadea28_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Sufficient phenotypic evidence combined with variant-level evidence (SOC influx measured was much higher and more consistent than wild-type; accumulation of the mutant was detected) and confirmed de-novo inheritance gives this proband default points.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7339dedd-e73b-4914-8054-8289f8bfa663","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24591628","rdfs:label":"NeST1","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":9,"detectionMethod":"Whole exome sequencing was performed on this proband, aligning reads to hg19 and filtering variants according to their presence in various databases.
