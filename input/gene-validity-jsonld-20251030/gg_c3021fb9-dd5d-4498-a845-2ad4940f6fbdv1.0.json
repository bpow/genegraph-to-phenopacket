MT-TI was first reported in association with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in 1996 (Merante et al. 1996, PMID: 8889580). Three variants have been seen in five probands in three publications (PMIDs: 8889580, 12767666, 37124643). One homoplastic variant m.4300A>G is seen in most cases, including in a family segregating to 16 affected family members. Each variant has supporting histochemical and biochemical functional evidence from patient biopsies. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by expression studies (PMID: 8889580, 34265302). In summary, there is MODERATE evidence supporting the relationship between MT-TI and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The ClinGen Hereditary Cardiovascular Disease GCEP approved this classification on the meeting date December 18, 2023.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c3021fb9-dd5d-4498-a845-2ad4940f6fbd","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3ac07ab9-8580-4fbf-b599-35dd25f3025d","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3ac07ab9-8580-4fbf-b599-35dd25f3025d_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10104","date":"2024-07-02T04:02:10.789Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3ac07ab9-8580-4fbf-b599-35dd25f3025d_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10104","date":"2023-12-18T01:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3ac07ab9-8580-4fbf-b599-35dd25f3025d_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3ac07ab9-8580-4fbf-b599-35dd25f3025d_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/580102eb-28bd-468c-8c9b-51d18b914aab","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"supported
