The cloning of the cDNA encoding FANCF by complementation of an FA-F cell line was first reported in 2000 (PMID:10615118). Fourteen different pathogenetic homozygous or compound heterozygous variants of FANCF account for approximately 2 to 3% of the affected individuals (PMID: 31288759). Disease-associated variants have been reported throughout the single coding exon of the FANCF gene. The most commonly seen FANCF variants are short frameshift deletions, resulting in premature termination of the protein, suggesting homozygous loss of function is the mechanism of tumorigenesis for this disorder (PMID: 10615118, 16084127, 31288759, 26033879, 27714961). This gene-disease relationship is further supported by FANCF-deficient mouse model, rescue cell culture model, protein interaction and expression studies. In summary, FANCF is definitively associated with FA complementation group F. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ee6ec3dc-0647-4038-9324-b894d479d662","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/60719ed8-36fa-4d11-93b2-8036133510a6","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":{"id":"cg:sopChange"},"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/60719ed8-36fa-4d11-93b2-8036133510a6_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10023","date":"2021-02-03T22:55:52.206Z","role":"Publisher"},{"agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10085","role":"SecondaryContributor"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/60719ed8-36fa-4d11-93b2-8036133510a6_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10023","date":"2021-02-03T22:54:56.822Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/60719ed8-36fa-4d11-93b2-8036133510a6_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/60719ed8-36fa-4d11-93b2-8036133510a6_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/59006c0b-8097-4075-9231-72e31c61db25","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6baeaea3-df4f-4d93-86be-f32b4913178c","type":"Finding","dc:description":"FANCF protein expression in the EUFA698 and  EUFA121 FA-F patient lymphoblast cell lines was absent.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10615118","rdfs:label":"Immuno-precipitation and western-blot analysis","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionB"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c391b94e-f6b3-4963-9e60-8b69f33fa3d8","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The protein interactions were supported by three independent experiments of co-immunoprecipitation of FANCA, FANCG and FANCC.","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/315b4142-3963-4070-a942-7c0cd27b5459","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that FANCF forms a complex with other components of the FA pathway, including FANCA, FANCC, and FANCG, in wild-type lymphoblasts.
