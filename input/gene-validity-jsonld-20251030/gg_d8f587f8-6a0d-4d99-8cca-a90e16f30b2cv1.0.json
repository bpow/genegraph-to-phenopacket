It is shown to be Golgi localized and is an enzyme involved in the maturation of N-linked glycans in the secretory pathway [PMIDs: 21697506, 24627495, 24348268]. Bi-allelic variants in MAN1B1 are reported in individuals characterized by syndromic intellectual disability and biochemical glycosylation defects [PMIDs: 20345473, 24348268, 24566669, 26279649, 28940310, 29908352, 30221345, 30776362]. Serum isoelectric focusing assay shows a CDG type II N-glycosylation defect in samples from these affected individuals. Hence, this curation is for MAN1B1 associated autosomal recessive congenital disorder of glycosylation (MAN1B1-CDG). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. There are about ~35 affected individuals from ~21 families reported in the published literature, comprising mostly of consanguineous families [PMIDs: 20345473, 24348268, 24566669, 30221345, 28940310, 29908352, 30776362]. The MAN1B1 variants seen in affected individuals include nonsense, frameshift and missense changes. Many of these variants are shown to either result in reduced enzyme activity and expression levels, distinct structure of N-linked glycans on serum glycoproteins when compared to controls using mass spectrometry and aberrant Golgi morphology in fibroblasts from affected individuals [PMIDs: 21763484, 24348268, 24566669]. In regards to experimental data, biochemical function and an animal model support this gene-disease association [PMIDs: 10409699, 10521544, 10995765, 18003979; https://www.mousephenotype.org/data/genes/MGI:2684954].
