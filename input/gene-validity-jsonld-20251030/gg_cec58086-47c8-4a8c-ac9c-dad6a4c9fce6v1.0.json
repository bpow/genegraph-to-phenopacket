Patients with condition present with dental anomalies such as isolated tooth agenesis, microdontia, short tooth roots and, taurodontism. Additional clinical features include sparse and slow-growing hair, and dry and itchy skin. \n3 missense variants from 2 publications have been included in this curation (PMIDs: 26416033, 28992378). The mechanism of pathogenicity is unclear. One mutation generates a hypermorphic allele with an increased inhibitory activity while the impact of other mutations must be further investigated. This gene-disease pair is also supported by expression studies, protein interaction assays, and a mouse model (PMIDs: 24686385, 26416033, 19073177, 15039429). \nIn summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the Craniofacial Malformations Gene Curation Expert Panel on the meeting date 01/16/2025 (SOP Version 11)\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cec58086-47c8-4a8c-ac9c-dad6a4c9fce6","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ef7b431e-de56-4e8b-a505-122f2e04a80a","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ef7b431e-de56-4e8b-a505-122f2e04a80a_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10059","date":"2025-01-16T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ef7b431e-de56-4e8b-a505-122f2e04a80a_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10059","date":"2025-04-08T17:37:12.492Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ef7b431e-de56-4e8b-a505-122f2e04a80a_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/412b57ff-1b6d-4ca5-9099-bd45286f9a02","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/412b57ff-1b6d-4ca5-9099-bd45286f9a02_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26416033","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/da1623ec-e5a6-484d-87e9-7440cfbec611","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_022469.4(GREM2):c.408G>T (p.Glu136Asp)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA16043956"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:AlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Heterozygous"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":0.1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9b5d9997-97bb-4ad5-9bb0-cba1c265bbdc","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Functional assay was previously scored.
