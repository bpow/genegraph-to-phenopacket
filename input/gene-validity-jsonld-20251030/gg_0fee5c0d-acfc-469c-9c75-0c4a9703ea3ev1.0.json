At least 4 unique variants (missense, frameshift) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 4 probands in 3 publications (PMID: 25077649, 25759012, 30894143). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 31 additional family members. This gene-disease association is supported by animal models and expression studies. In summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease association. While more evidence is needed to establish this association definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hearing Loss Working Group on 2/6/2020.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0fee5c0d-acfc-469c-9c75-0c4a9703ea3e","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a493a4c4-3a9f-431a-a68e-d90d9a11b6f0","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a493a4c4-3a9f-431a-a68e-d90d9a11b6f0_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2020-02-06T17:20:31.658Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a493a4c4-3a9f-431a-a68e-d90d9a11b6f0_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a493a4c4-3a9f-431a-a68e-d90d9a11b6f0_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a493a4c4-3a9f-431a-a68e-d90d9a11b6f0_ad_null_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fb22e57b-c6bd-4f89-920c-3f39567412ad_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Family was of German descent.
