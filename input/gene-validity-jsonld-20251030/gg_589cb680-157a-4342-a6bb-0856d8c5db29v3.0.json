This protein has been shown to localize to the mitochondria of kidney cells and have a role in ciliary function. (provided by RefSeq, Mar 2011). \n\n*XPNPEP3* was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Nephronophthisis-like Nephropathy 1 (NPHPL1) in 2010 (O'Toole et al. PMID: 20179356). The mechanism of disease is biallelic loss of function. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level, segregation, and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 6 probands in 5 publications (PMID: 29383790, 32660933,37599822,38035175, DOI: 10.1681/ASN.20233411S1571a). Unpublished data was included in this curation, a patient with a consistent phenotype associated with compound heterozygous null variants (Molecular Biology Laboratory, Fundació Puigvert and  submitted to ClinVar), increasing the final score by 3.0 points for a total of 11.3 genetic evidence points. \n\nThis gene-disease association is supported by protein interaction, in vitro functional assays, and a zebrafish and a mouse model (PMID: 20179356, 37599822). There is significant correlation between β-catenin nuclear localization and XPNPEP3 levels, suggesting *XPNPEP3* has a role in Wnt-mediated regulation of ciliary development (Kumar et al. 2018; PMID: 29383790, non-scorable evidence).\n\nIn summary, there is Definitive evidence to support *XPNPEP3* as a cause of an autosomal recessive ciliopathy. This gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the ClinGen Kidney Cystic and Ciliopathy Disorders GCEP on 04/28/2021 (SOP Version 8). It was reevaluated on 6/10/2024 (SOP Version 10). As a result of this reevaluation, the classification changed from Moderate to Definitive.
