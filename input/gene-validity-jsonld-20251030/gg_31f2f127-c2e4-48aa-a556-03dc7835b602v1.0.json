Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Summary of case-level and experimental data: 12.5 points. There are five patients reported in the literature with variants (nonsense, frameshift, and missense) (PMID: 26220973, PMID: 7719337, PMID: 27290639). This gene-disease association is supported by in vitro functional assays and animal models. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in molecular mechanism(s), inheritance pattern, and phenotypic variability underlying the disease entities: (1) Peroxisome biogenesis disorder 2A (MIM: 214110), (2) Peroxisome biogenesis disorder 2B (MIM: 202370), and (3) Rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata, type 5 (MIM: 616716). Therefore, all of the disease entities have been lumped into one disease entity, Peroxisome Biogenesis Disorder. In summary, PEX5 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive peroxisomal biogenesis disorder. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/31f2f127-c2e4-48aa-a556-03dc7835b602","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b49d9cfd-0e51-4219-84bb-76b4c9b99fa9","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b49d9cfd-0e51-4219-84bb-76b4c9b99fa9_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10049","date":"2020-01-17T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b49d9cfd-0e51-4219-84bb-76b4c9b99fa9_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10049","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b49d9cfd-0e51-4219-84bb-76b4c9b99fa9_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b49d9cfd-0e51-4219-84bb-76b4c9b99fa9_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8c05eef4-fa08-4ff2-86cb-867fa9f1588a","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1e7db180-381c-458c-84ea-68f4842d74c6","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Pxr1-/-
