The ADAR gene encodes RNA-specific adenosine deaminase, an RNA editing enzyme that catalyzes the deamination of adenosine to inosine in double-stranded RNA. Defects in this process result in an upregulation of interferon response. As such, pathogenic variants in ADAR were initially reported to cause an interferonopathy, Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome type 6. Pathogenic variants in ADAR have been associated with Leigh syndrome spectrum (detailed below), however the diagnosis is often made based on imaging findings alone therefore metabolic laboratory testing required as part of the Leigh syndrome spectrum definition is often not performed, so many reported cases could not be curated for Leigh syndrome spectrum.\n\nThe ADAR gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Leigh syndrome spectrum in 2019 (PMID: 31772029). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included four unique variants identified in two cases from two publications (PMIDs: 31772029, 30692772). No segregation data were available. Loss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease association is also supported by biochemical function, expression, and model systems (PMIDs: 27977873, 25613900, 11099415, 26275108). \n\nIn summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on April 20, 2020 (SOP Version 7).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ac7aed13-50be-4465-a6e3-2227c03dd353","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/03f538b5-43af-4699-9ddb-264077de21c9","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/03f538b5-43af-4699-9ddb-264077de21c9_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2020-09-16T19:23:36.454Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/03f538b5-43af-4699-9ddb-264077de21c9_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2020-08-27T16:46:42.352Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/03f538b5-43af-4699-9ddb-264077de21c9_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/03f538b5-43af-4699-9ddb-264077de21c9_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d2482ef2-ea69-4d30-93e1-eb230a0d42be","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"scored according to GCEP rubric","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/968bf3b6-658c-4891-b3ef-277d7f922fc6","type":"Finding","dc:description":"growth retardation/embryonic death due to hemotopoietic defect in homozygous knock-in LOF mouse model","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26275108","rdfs:label":"Liddicoat mouse model","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b6dcb0bd-e844-4d25-b884-6c6e79f60587","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"scored according to GCEP rubric","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/aeeb0472-cb49-49b6-ad25-dcc4d933c526","type":"Finding","dc:description":"growth retardation/embryonic death due to hemotopoietic, liver defect in heterozygous KO chimeric mice","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11099415","rdfs:label":"Wang mouse model","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/03f538b5-43af-4699-9ddb-264077de21c9_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/46a4922c-9c55-4acb-945c-5a46d339a43e","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/475c9ded-f9bf-44b9-bb7d-3350d40dc07e","type":"Finding","dc:description":"RNASEH1 is also an RNA-specific adenosine deaminase that results in a Leigh or Leigh-like phenotype (31271879: Souza et al. 2019).","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27977873","rdfs:label":"Leigh map","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionA"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/31f91cd6-81d5-4124-8170-e44bb3e0bb14","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"expressed in brain and basal ganglia; no evidence of disruption of expression in disease","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/da46f349-42a0-4404-a202-bae2d668e6fd","type":"Finding","dc:description":"human protein atlas data","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25613900","rdfs:label":"human protein atlas","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/03f538b5-43af-4699-9ddb-264077de21c9_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3acd4fdd-2f18-4877-a7a4-8fb990f4fb12_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"frameshift in trans with missense","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/59fa7cce-38f2-49c7-a8d0-ffaddb7515c8","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30692772","rdfs:label":"Samanta case report","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":5,"detectionMethod":"Mitochondrial genome sequencing also done.","firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"Diagnosed with mild spastic diplegia at birth.

Other problems included feeding difficulties, gastro-oesophageal reflux, faltering growth, hypermetropia and hypothyroidism. Examination at age 9 years revealed freckles on his face and hands. He had a very soft systolic murmur, but cardiovascular examination was otherwise normal. There was no ptosis and there was a full range of eye movements without nystagmus. He had dysarthric speech. He had hypotonic arms with good muscle strength but symmetrically hypertonic legs with fixed flexion contractures at the knees. Reflexes were generally brisk, especially in the legs. Early blood investigations demonstrated intermittently elevated lactates with significant hyperalaninaemia, but at age 9 years blood lactate was repeatedly normal (1.1–1.3 mmol/L). MRI brain demonstrated symmetrically increased signal in the lenticular nuclei and posterior limbs of the internal capsules. Nerve conduction studies showed a demyelinating sensorimotor axonal neuropathy. The clinical features and MRI appearances\nled to suspicion of Leigh syndrome spectrum. Muscle histology showed mild myopathic features with excess lipid, but no ragged-red fibres or cytochrome oxidase-negative fibres. Muscle respiratory chain enzyme assays demonstrated an isolated deficiency of complex IV (0.007, reference 0.014–0.034) with normal activities of complex I, complexes II+III and coenzyme Q10.
