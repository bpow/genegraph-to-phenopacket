(1995). Plenty of case level studies have been performed with HME patients that have variants in the EXT1 gene. EXT2 also cause hereditary multiple exostoses and a working model for the formation of exostoses has been proposed to link the heparan sulfate biosynthesis function of EXT1. Multiple mouse models have been established to show the development of osteochondromas and exostoses with EXT1 deficiency. All of these evidence suggest a definitive relationship between the EXT1 gene and Hereditary Multiple Exostoses (HME).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/16907bce-97d6-4595-84c4-cc1d2e9446c8","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0ced1387-c0a8-4f03-bd70-1595cb7683fd","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0ced1387-c0a8-4f03-bd70-1595cb7683fd_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10023","date":"2018-06-04T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0ced1387-c0a8-4f03-bd70-1595cb7683fd_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10023","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"Segregation points should be 1.5, but doesn't change the total points.","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0ced1387-c0a8-4f03-bd70-1595cb7683fd_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0ced1387-c0a8-4f03-bd70-1595cb7683fd_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/853a444c-ea94-4068-89aa-1bc04237166b","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Ext1-SKO mice recapitulate many of the key features of human MHE.
