It includes a spectrum from commonly mild (such as febrile seizure alone) to rarely severe (including medically treatable generalized epilepsy, intractable generalized epilepsy, or in some cases Dravet syndrome) epilepsy. Individuals with GEFS+ often have febrile seizures (or FS+) in early childhood, followed by occasional tonic, clonic, myoclonic, or absence seizures that respond to medication and remit by late childhood or early adolescence. Intermediate phenotypes with myoclonic, absence, or focal epilepsy are also included. \nMore than 95% of individuals with GEFS+ have a parent with the same SCN1A pathogenic variant (Gennaro et al, 2003); however, the risk of developing seizures is less than 100% because of reduced penetrance, estimated to be 70% for the GEFS+ phenotype (Bonanniet al, 2004). In summary, SCN1A is definitively associated with Generalized Epilepsy with Febrile Seizures Plus. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d10f05e7-efc1-47bb-a4e3-cfe01e0967bd","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5ac39f7a-0743-47b1-8efd-21e0ca836840","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5ac39f7a-0743-47b1-8efd-21e0ca836840_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10005","date":"2019-09-06T19:43:57.485Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5ac39f7a-0743-47b1-8efd-21e0ca836840_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10005","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5ac39f7a-0743-47b1-8efd-21e0ca836840_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5ac39f7a-0743-47b1-8efd-21e0ca836840_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/09b983b7-3b9f-44c1-a652-c861eb1b4e9f","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Increased the scoring due to several characteristics of the R1648H knock-in mice well represent the clinical features of the human GEFS+ patients in which the same heterozygous variant has been well reported, showing spontaneous generalized seizures and a reduced threshold to thermally induced seizures.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e7772cc0-c0ad-44f5-a05f-1dea9655065f","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Several characteristics of the R1648H knock-in mice are similar to the clinical features of the human GEFS+ patients, who are heterozygous for the mutation. Heterozygous Scn1aRH/+ mice have normal life spans, reduced thresholds to febrile seizures, and spontaneous seizures. Homozygous Scn1aRH/RH mutant mice developed spontaneous seizures and weight loss starting at P15, the time when Scn1a expression approaches adult levels (16). Generalized seizures were frequently observed in the homozygous mutants, and these mice had an average life span of 18.5 days. Because severe convulsive seizures may impair the autonomic nervous system and lead to cardiac arrest (29), premature lethality in these mice may be due to severe motor seizures. Consistent with the severe phenotype of homozygous mice, there are no known patients with two mutant SCN1A alleles. In addition, Scn1aRH/RH mutants also display jumping, erratic behavior, and tail clonus in response to mild startle. This hyper-responsive behavior, which may reflect seizure activity, was not seen in Scn1aRH/+ mice or WT littermates.

We observed that more than 50% of R1648H transgenic mice (Lines 5 and 9) but fewer than 25% of control transgenic mice (Lines 1 and 8) progressed to generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS) (Fig. 2A). Only 10% of Line 1 mice progressed to GTCS, which was significantly lower than for the mutant transgenic lines (Line 5: 58%; P= 0.03 and Line 9: 73%; P= 0.01) (Fig. 2A). A trend towards greater resistance to KA was also observed in the control transgenic mice from Line 8 (25% progressing to GTCS), although this difference was not statistically different from the mutant lines (Line 8 versus Line 5, P= 0.20; Line 8 versus Line 9, P= 0.07). Forty-two percent of wild-type littermates progressed to GTCS, which is higher than control transgenic mice but lower than mutant transgenic mice. However, these differences between transgenic mice and wild-type littermates were not statistically significant. The control transgenic lines also reached a lower average score on the modified Racine scale compared with the mutant lines, and the difference in severity score between Line 1 and the mutant lines was statistically significant (Line 1 versus Line 5, P= 0.02; Line 1 versus Line 9, P= 0.03) (Fig. 2B). These results suggest that the R1648H mutation leads to a more severe response to KA. In contrast, the higher levels of wild-type Nav1.1 in the control transgenic lines appear to be associated with a less severe response to KA.\nIn the R1648H transgenic mice, slower and incomplete recovery from inactivation and increased use-dependent inactivation would be expected to reduce channel availability in inhibitory neurons, most likely leading to partial loss of function. In addition, the smaller sodium current density in bipolar neurons from R1648H transgenic mice compared to wild- type or E954Q mice might indicate that the mutation specifically decreases sodium currents in those neurons. These results suggest that decreased sodium channel function in inhibitory neurons may lead to hyperexcitability in the CNS. This finding is consistent with observations from Scn1a knockout mice, in which reduced sodium currents in interneurons are observed (Kalume et al., 2007, Yu et al., 2006, Ogiwara et al., 2007). However, we also observed a hyperpolarized shift in the voltage dependence of inactivation in pyramidal neurons in R1648H mice. This would cause the mutant sodium channels to inactivate at more negative potentials, thereby reducing the activity of excitatory neurons, which should decrease seizure susceptibility. Since the expression of the Nav1.1 transgene is higher in bipolar neurons, we speculate that the defect in these neurons is more biologically important than the defect in pyramidal neurons. This same variant was explored in further detail by Martin et al, 2010 (PMID:20100831).","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19409490","rdfs:label":"BAC transgenic mouse model","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":0},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/368b3f81-423d-4618-a3db-f8d35644dc84","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"3/5 GEFS+ associated variants were able to be rescued by incubation at low temperature, interactions with different co-expressed proteins, and/or a pharmacological chaperone (phenytoin).

Scn1a mRNA expression was relatively high in thalamus, superior colliculus, inferior colliculus, deep cerebellar nuclei, pons, medulla, and spinal cord, whereas it was low in hippocampus, cerebral cortex, and cerebellum (Fig. 4Aa; supplemental Figs. 5A, 6, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material).

In addition, homozygous knock-in mice showed no obvious in situ hybridization signals (supplemental Figs. 4Ab, 5b, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material), indicating the high specificity of cellular Scn1a mRNA localization in the present study.
