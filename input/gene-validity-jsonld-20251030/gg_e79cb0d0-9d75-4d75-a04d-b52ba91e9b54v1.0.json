Six variants (missense, nonsense, frameshift) that have been reported in thirteen probands in four publications (PMIDs: 30578397, 32934261, 33007923, 35281600) are included in this curation. However, only two variants (nonsense, frameshift) were scored (PMIDs: 32934261, 35281600) as the other variants were only seen in isolated idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension cases and/or were too frequent in population databases. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss-of-function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence (NCBI fetal expression data). In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship.This classification was approved by the ClinGen Congenital Heart Disease GCEP on the meeting date 5/13/2024 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e79cb0d0-9d75-4d75-a04d-b52ba91e9b54","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/44a6fa0b-b6e7-422e-9d01-b74aad2a8b29","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/44a6fa0b-b6e7-422e-9d01-b74aad2a8b29_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10130","date":"2024-05-13T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/44a6fa0b-b6e7-422e-9d01-b74aad2a8b29_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10130","date":"2024-06-11T16:01:11.866Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/44a6fa0b-b6e7-422e-9d01-b74aad2a8b29_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/44a6fa0b-b6e7-422e-9d01-b74aad2a8b29_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7cea9e56-f8d6-434b-a1db-6711b440cb1a","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7525b659-4c94-41d4-8328-b3d8d36c563f","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Fetal expression is pretty high between 10-20 weeks gestation.
