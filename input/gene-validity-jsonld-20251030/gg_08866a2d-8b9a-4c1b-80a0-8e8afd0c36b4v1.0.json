The SLC39A8 gene encodes a transporter that functions in Mn, Zn, Cd, and Fe transport across the plasma membrane. Pathogenic variants in SLC39A8 have also been associated with a congenital disorder of glycosylation characterized by intellectual disability, developmental delay, cerebellar atrophy, and short stature (PMID: 26637978, 26637979).\n\nThe only report of SLC39A8 gene in relation to autosomal recessive Leigh syndrome spectrum was in 2017 (PMID: 27995398). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included one variant identified in one case in one publication (PMID: 27995398). No segregation data were available. Loss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease association is also supported by expression, functional alterations in non-patient cells, and a model system (PMIDs: 25613900, 29453449, 22563477). \n\nIn summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel June 8, 2020 (SOP Version 7).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/08866a2d-8b9a-4c1b-80a0-8e8afd0c36b4","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5fddaae4-d982-49e7-9e83-b84d15f3cf2c","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5fddaae4-d982-49e7-9e83-b84d15f3cf2c_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2020-11-23T19:51:04.867Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5fddaae4-d982-49e7-9e83-b84d15f3cf2c_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2020-11-23T19:56:07.979Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5fddaae4-d982-49e7-9e83-b84d15f3cf2c_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/689b5044-f313-4711-9f43-352d3b424a82_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Biochemical investigations including transferrin analysis demonstrating an abnormal glycosylation pattern consistent with a CDG type II defect (as reported in other patients with SLC39A8 deficiency) and undetectable manganese in blood and urine support pathogenicity of the variant.","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ae92784f-62ad-4473-84bd-534a60fb4b9c","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27995398","rdfs:label":"Riley Patient","ageType":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/","ageUnit":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/","detectionMethod":"Whole genome sequencing was undertaken on patient 2 and her parents, to provide a genetic diagnosis for the family.
