Only two variants with supporting evidence for pathogenicity (one de novo) in this gene have been found in individuals with NSML (Carcavilla et al., 2013; Kuburovic, Vukomanovic, Carcavilla, Ezquieta-Zubicaray, & Kuburovic, 2011; Pandit et al., 2007). The RAF1 gene is also located in the Ras/MAPK pathway, which is associated with the NSML phenotype (Aoki et al., 2016; Rauen, 2013). Of note, RAF1 is also classified as Definitive in association with Noonan syndrome (NS) and as Disputed in association with Costello syndrome and cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome. The ClinGen RASopathy Expert Panel found no evidence associating RAF1 with NS-like disorder with loose anagen hair. This curation was approved by the ClinGen RASopathy Gene Curation Expert Panel on 7/25/18 (SOP Version 5).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b00f5aa0-06cf-4e6b-b64b-e8aa2684d867","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cda0bf05-836b-40bb-99f5-e1dbfd0f6741","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","changes":{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cda0bf05-836b-40bb-99f5-e1dbfd0f6741_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10021","date":"2018-07-25T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cda0bf05-836b-40bb-99f5-e1dbfd0f6741_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10021","date":"2021-03-10T16:02:20.446Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cda0bf05-836b-40bb-99f5-e1dbfd0f6741_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cda0bf05-836b-40bb-99f5-e1dbfd0f6741_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5ffe9b1a-c44b-4a5e-8eec-38a842140d5f","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/aecd22ce-08a0-4a74-85d1-34b4e18a2aa5","type":"Finding","dc:description":"This gene is associated with the RAS/MAPK pathway which is affiliated with the RASopathies and therefore can be used as supportng evidence for the gene disease affiliation.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23875798","rdfs:label":"RAF1 in the RAS/MAPK pathway","demonstrates":{"id":"obo:MI_0915"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cda0bf05-836b-40bb-99f5-e1dbfd0f6741_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/dc865b04-60d3-44d8-9ea3-1740a3d365c8","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Doesn't provide specific evidence for NS condition","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/41485ea6-2070-41e6-a57f-089cb8c95b8c","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Both the p.Leu613Val and p.Leu613Val mutant proteins showed increased kinase activity compared to the WT control.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17603483","rdfs:label":"p.Ser257Leu and p.Leu613Val proteins"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2d6b1900-f53c-4a7a-818c-8d175f0c6966","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"doesn't provide evidence for NS","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e8812c38-13f1-4e06-997e-c4c6178a12ff","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"The p.Ser257Leu protein was found not to be phophorylated at the Ser259 residue which is crucial for protein function.ELK activation was enhanced in p.Ser257Leu expressing cells compared to cells expressing the WT protein. \nAs in the Pandit et al. 2007 study, the p.Ser257Leu variant did not bind to 14-3-3.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20052757","rdfs:label":"p.Ser257Leu variant"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cda0bf05-836b-40bb-99f5-e1dbfd0f6741_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b5f825cb-731b-4037-95a3-c4e6a4faafab","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"while this may be strong evidence for the pathogenicity of this variant and the ability of this gene to cause RASopathy phenotypes, it doesn't provide solid evidence to show that the gene causes only NSML","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/85f3ad1c-5929-4664-bb12-9a577e5d71e7","type":"Finding","dc:description":"The study found that the p.Leu613Val and p.Ser257Leu variants showed decreased phosphorylation at the p.Ser621 residue  compared to WT protein which negatively affects the stability of the protein.
