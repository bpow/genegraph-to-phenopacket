{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1beac563-b555-4e11-a0a1-4c4d925f5553v1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"The relationship between *MT-ATP6* and primary mitochondrial disease was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of May 18, 2023. The MT-ATP6 gene encodes the ATP synthase (complex V) subunit 6. Defects of this protein lead to complex V deficiency.\n\n*MT-ATP6* was first reported in relation to maternally-inherited primary mitochondrial disease in 1990 in a family with variable developmental delay, retinitis pigmentosa, dementia, seizures, ataxia, proximal neurogenic muscle weakness, and sensory neuropathy (PMID: 2137962). Other associated features have been reported over time. While various names could be given to the constellation of features seen in those with *MT-ATP6*-related disorders, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *MT- ATP6* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework. Of note, *MT- ATP6* was first curated by this GCEP for its association with Leigh syndrome spectrum (LSS) on May 24, 2021 (SOP v8), with a final classification of Definitive. This current curation for the association with primary mitochondrial disease includes cases with LSS.\n\nEvidence supporting the gene-disease relationship between *MT-ATP6* and primary mitochondrial disease includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation includes eight variants (m.8851T>C, m.8969G>A, m.8993T>C, m.8993T>G, m.9176T>C, m.9176T>G, m.9185T>C, m.9191T>C) \n in 17 probands in 15 publications (PMIDs: 1550128, 8554662, 23206802, 1456751, 9270604, 9501263, 10604142, 17352390, 11245730, 16217706, 11731285, 27812026, 25037980, 19747204, 2137962). Age of onset in affected individuals ranged from childhood to adulthood. Clinical features in affected individuals included LSS; neurogenic muscle weakness, ataxia, and retinitis pigmentosa (NARP); and mitochondrial myopathy, lactic acidosis, and sideroblastic anemia (MLASA); as well as seizures, ataxia, choreoathetosis, axonal sensorimotor neuropathy, cognitive decline, muscle weakness, ptosis, Wolff-Parkinson-White arrhythmia, nephropathy, and sensorineural hearing loss. Brain imaging was variable and ranged from normal to findings consistent with LSS. Muscle biopsies showed accumulation of subsarcolemmal mitochondria, diminished oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) activity, and decreased steady state levels of complex V. Metabolic screening labs showed elevated blood and cerebrospinal fluid lactate. Heteroplasmy levels were variable in affected individuals and their healthy family members. Segregation evidence is scored as case-level data according to the criteria established by the Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss of function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by known biochemical function, cybrid studies, and yeast models (PMIDs: 27977873, 19160410, 18256697, 24316278, 17855363).  \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between *MT-ATP6* and primary mitochondrial disease. This has been repeatedly demonstrated and upheld over time, and no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts this gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on on May 18, 2023","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1beac563-b555-4e11-a0a1-4c4d925f5553","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8d7b0569-8dfe-40cf-a83b-44071430206f","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8d7b0569-8dfe-40cf-a83b-44071430206f_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2023-09-12T20:09:06.579Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8d7b0569-8dfe-40cf-a83b-44071430206f_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2023-05-18T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8d7b0569-8dfe-40cf-a83b-44071430206f_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d54d6668-0027-4417-b1a8-14c690972bdc","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"This variant is located at the same amino acid position as another well-known pathogenic variant, m.9176T>C (p.L217P) (PM5).
