DDC encodes aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AADC), also known as dopa decarboxylase, an enzyme that catalyzes the decarboxylation of L-Dopa to dopamine, and decarboxylation of L-5- hydroxytryptophan to serotonin (Montioli and Voltattorni, 2021; PMID 33808712). In patients with AADC deficiency, low levels of dopamine and serotonin results in symptoms such as movement disorder, developmental delay, hypotonia, oculogyric crises, and autonomic features.\n\nThe disease mechanism is loss of function. AADC deficiency was first reported in 1990 (Hyland and Clayton, PMID: 1700191) and the first report of biallelic variants in DDC in patients with AADC deficiency was published in 1998 (Chang, J. Inherit. Metab. Dis. 21: 4, 1998). Since then, over 80 variants associated with AADC deficiency have been identified in over 120 patients (Montioli and Voltattorni, 2021; PMID 33808712). The relationship between DDC and AADC deficiency is supported by case-level and experimental evidence. Thirteen unique variants from ten probands in four publications were curated (Pons et al, 2004, PMID: 15079002; Tay et al, 2007, PMID: 17533144; Leuzzi et al, 2014, PMID: 24788355; Wen et al, 2020, PMID: 32409695). The most common variant, c.714+4A>T, a founder variant accounting for ~45% of AADC alleles in Taiwan and mainland China, is located in intron 6 and affects splicing (Lee et al, 2009, PMID: 18567514; Brun et al, 2010, PMID: 20505134; Tsai et al, 2018, PMID 30260058; Wen et al, 2019, PMID: 32409695). Further information is available in the literature but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. \n\nExperimental evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes the biochemical function of AADC, which is consistent with the biochemical and clinical findings in patients (Siaterli et al, 2003, PMID: 12718431; Montioli et al, 2021, PMID: 33808712), the biochemical and clinical features of a mouse with a knock-in human variant (Lee et al, 2013, PMID: 23275025), and the impact of gene therapy in human patients (Tai et al, 2022, PMID: 34763085). Additional experimental evidence is available in the literature but the maximum points for experimental evidence (6 points) has been reached. \n\nIn summary, DDC is definitively associated with AADC. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3b5d6034-e451-4388-9d80-21a5e934b011","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1dea33e3-7cf6-47f9-aa52-2525b439031a","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1dea33e3-7cf6-47f9-aa52-2525b439031a_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10097","date":"2022-03-29T21:57:08.582Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1dea33e3-7cf6-47f9-aa52-2525b439031a_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10097","date":"2022-02-25T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1dea33e3-7cf6-47f9-aa52-2525b439031a_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1dea33e3-7cf6-47f9-aa52-2525b439031a_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f34184c0-4be2-4560-816d-ef935654defb","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"These mice were generated by knock in of a human variant in DDC that is known to cause AADC deficiency.
