The first patients with FA complementation group E were reported in 1996 (PMID: 9147877, 7662964). Five homozygous variants in the FANCE gene were observed in individuals with FA complementation group E, and three of these variants were reported to segregate with disease in three small families, suggesting homozygous loss of function is the mechanism of tumorigenesis for this disorder (PMID: 11001585, 17924555). This gene-disease relationship is further supported by rescue cell culture model, protein interaction and functional alteration studies. In summary, FANCE is definitively associated with FA complementation group E. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4469ccec-b8ae-4e2d-84dc-d468775361cd","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6da55a6e-2cf8-499c-b842-b5a435dbff3f","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6da55a6e-2cf8-499c-b842-b5a435dbff3f_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10023","date":"2020-09-16T19:22:58.222Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6da55a6e-2cf8-499c-b842-b5a435dbff3f_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10023","date":"2020-05-14T00:17:45.604Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6da55a6e-2cf8-499c-b842-b5a435dbff3f_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6da55a6e-2cf8-499c-b842-b5a435dbff3f_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a40c9230-ff88-421a-9e3e-77363847dd9e","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The rescue experiments indicate that FANCE is required for the monoubiquitination of FANCD2 and downstream events in the FA pathway, providing compelling evidence for FANCE as a causative gene in FA patients.","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/66ddd18d-c790-43b7-a7ec-42e16158e232","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Transfection with FANCE in EUFA130 (the FANCE null cell line) corrected the MMC sensitivity of 3 independent FA-E lymphoblast cell lines—EUFA130, EUFA410, and EUFA622 (Fig. 1A).
