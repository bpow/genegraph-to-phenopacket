{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3b1f0abf-3b37-4ee6-9033-86786b0e0a65v1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"The *TLR7* (Toll-like receptor 7) gene encodes a viral RNA sensor (PMID:35477763) that plays a key role in the recognition of pathogen-derived single-stranded RNA (ssRNA), which is integral to the innate immune response to viral infections. TLR7 can also recognize self-derived ssRNA, which may underlie the association of gain-of-function mutations in this gene with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (PMID:38324161). *TLR7* was first reported in relation to X-linked dominant SLE in 2022 (Brown et al., PMID:35477763). \n\nGenetic evidence reviewed in the curation of this gene-disease relationship included 6 probands with 4 unique heterozygous variants. The molecular mechanism of disease is gain of function: only rare missense variants with *in vitro* functional evidence of gain of function have been reported (PMID: 35477763, 38753439, 38324161). No loss of function variants have been reported in individuals with SLE (ClinVar, literature review). Genetic evidence that was not scored include one study that reported association of *TLR7* copy number gain with SLE (PMID:20525845); however, this finding has not been replicated. In addition, common variants in *TLR7* are associated with increased risk of SLE and/or SLE-related phenotypes in cases compared to healthy controls (PMID: 33272962, 20733074, 36439744, 33650302), but these associations have not been replicated in genome-wide association studies. \n\nThe gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence including biochemical function, function alterations and animal model data. SLE patients with *TLR7* variants display increased NFkB activity and B cell alterations typical for lupus (PMID: 38753439, 38324161, 35477763). A knock-in animal model of the p.Y264H variant recapitulates lupus-like phenotypes in mice (PMID: 35477763).\n\nIn summary, there is **moderate** evidence supporting the relationship between TLR7 and X-linked dominant systemic lupus erythematosus. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Monogenic Systemic and Incomplete Lupus Erythematosus GCEP on the meeting date October 11, 2024 (SOP Version 11).\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3b1f0abf-3b37-4ee6-9033-86786b0e0a65","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6ad2864d-9d38-46ad-9bb0-5020b87cbe55","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6ad2864d-9d38-46ad-9bb0-5020b87cbe55_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10123","date":"2025-03-17T15:46:38.178Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6ad2864d-9d38-46ad-9bb0-5020b87cbe55_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10123","date":"2024-10-11T19:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6ad2864d-9d38-46ad-9bb0-5020b87cbe55_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6ad2864d-9d38-46ad-9bb0-5020b87cbe55_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/29bb4bc1-6098-4b58-b4ee-daa9596bd505","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3b1df6d4-fd55-4b16-869e-b12b5c757cda","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Mouse phenotype is consistent with SLE model\nPhenotype includes: ANA positivity, proliferative glomerulonephritis, and other organ changes\nIncreased NFKB activation\n","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35477763","rdfs:label":"Mouse model ","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9baca5ea-2293-4688-870c-d9a5c1067243","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7c00d602-e0f6-445e-b253-a737e3ec81cc","type":"Finding","dc:description":"MyD88 deficiency rescued splenomegaly, accumulation of ABCs, GC B cells, plasma cells, eTH cells  and autoantibody formation, aberrant survival of B cells receiving only signal 1 was completely abolished in anti-IgM-activated kika B cells lacking MyD88 without changes in proliferation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35477763","rdfs:label":"Rescue in mouse model","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:PhenotypeRescue"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanRescueCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6ad2864d-9d38-46ad-9bb0-5020b87cbe55_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ac11bb1b-7706-4e09-8f33-eafba392f306","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8fa88d9f-a370-4d27-a9da-80059632ca73","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Y264H PBMCs from proband A.II.1 showed IgD−CD27− B cells were substantially increased compared with gender- and age-matched controls","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35477763","rdfs:label":"TLR7-mediated autoimmunity is MyD88 dependent"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9063ed8d-9515-4788-926d-dd3e917f3785","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d49c1177-a5a3-4e20-ae21-ea10df11865a","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"expressed WT and variant (c.1520T>C (p.F507S) TLR7 in HEK293T cells, which lack TLRs, using an NF-κB luciferase reporter as the read-out. measured reporter activity following stimulation with the TLR7 agonist R848.
