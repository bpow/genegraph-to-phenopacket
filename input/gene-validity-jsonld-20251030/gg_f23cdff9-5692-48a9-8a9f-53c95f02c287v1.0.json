FOXG1 disorder, however, is a clinically distinct entity characterized by onset of neurodevelopmental impairment congenitally or during early infancy, in contrast to typical Rett syndrome in which symptoms appear after a period of normal development. Patients with FOXG1 disorder can also have epilepsy, motor dysfunction, stereotypic hand movements, abnormal breathing, lack of speech development, and corpus callosum hypoplasia on MRI. Variants in FOXG1 were first reported in patients with this disorder by Ariani et al. (2008). Males and females are equally affected, and the mechanism of disease is loss of function. Both sequence and copy  number loss variants have been reported in patients with FOXG1 disorder. All reported variants are presumed to have arisen de novo. Experimental evidence, including mouse models with neurological phenotypes consistent with FOXG1 disorder (Xuan et al 1995, Shen et al. 2006, Tian et al. 2012) as well as interaction with MECP2, the causative gene of classical Rett syndrome (Dastidar et al 2012, Orlic-Milacic et al 2014) support the role of FOXG1 in this disease. This disease association is not accounted for in this assessment. In summary, the association between FOXG1 and FOXG1 disorder has been classified as definitive. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.
