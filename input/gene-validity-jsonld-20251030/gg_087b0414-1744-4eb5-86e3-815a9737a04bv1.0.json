CSRP3 was first associated with this disease in humans in 2003 (Geier et al., PMID 12642359). The mechanism for disease is unknown. The gene-disease association is supported by expression studies and in vitro assays. In summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease association with HCM. While more evidence is needed to establish this association definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/087b0414-1744-4eb5-86e3-815a9737a04b","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/130d778f-f756-4f3d-b6b2-909e40836c5a","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/130d778f-f756-4f3d-b6b2-909e40836c5a_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10008","date":"2021-01-26T20:58:06.221Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/130d778f-f756-4f3d-b6b2-909e40836c5a_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10008","date":"2017-12-19T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/130d778f-f756-4f3d-b6b2-909e40836c5a_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/130d778f-f756-4f3d-b6b2-909e40836c5a_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fa427060-5b7f-4979-b716-2ab1801b50f9","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Of note, ECG studies showed that MLP-/- mice show LV chamber enlargement, the walls are THINNED, and LV function is reduced.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3df0f51b-f975-48d1-b6ff-aa21fa089db2","type":"Finding","dc:description":"35-65% of transgenic MLP-/- mice exhibit massive myocardial hypertrophy and die of rapid progressive congestive heart failure in the second postnatal week.
