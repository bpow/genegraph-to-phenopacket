At least 1 missense, 1 splicing, and 1 nonsense variant have been reported in humans. Two variants reported (Liu et al. 2001, PMID: 11741837) were subsequently shown to be located in a pseudogene (Pazenkas et al. 2003, PMID: 12457340). Three additional variants have no evidence of pathogenicity (PMIDs: 17259707, 23141803, ​​25724631). Of note, this gene has also been implicated in autosomal dominant atrioventricular septal defect 3, autosomal recessive craniometaphyseal dysplasia, autosomal dominant erythrokeratodermia variabilis et progressiva 3, autosomal recessive hypoplastic left heart syndrome 1, autosomal dominant oculodentodigital dysplasia, autosomal recessive oculodentodigital dysplasia, autosomal dominant palmoplantar keratoderma with congenital alopecia, and autosomal dominant syndactyly, type III. These will be assessed separately. In summary, the evidence supporting the relationship between GJA1 and AD NSHL has been disputed and no valid evidence remains to support the claim. More evidence is needed to either support or entirely refute the role GJA1 plays in this disease. This gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the Hearing Loss GCEP on 1/16/2018. It was reevaluated on 3/16/2022. Although additional publications were identified (PMIDs: 26185573, 25724631, 35023121), they did not contain valid scorable evidence. Therefore, as a result of this reevaluation, the classification did not change.
