{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ef6ad76d-1c14-40a5-a318-bb730193bfbdv1.1","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"MEGF8 was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Carpenter syndrome as early as 2012 (Twigg et al., PMID: 23063620). At least six different variants (missense, nonsense, splice site) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation includes six variants described in four probands in one publication (PMID: 23063620). In addition, we included one internal case, a proband with Carpenter syndrome who was compound heterozygous for c.4872delG (p.Phe1625Serfs) and c.7769_7771delCCT (p.Ser2590del), to reach a score of 6 points for genetic evidence. The mechanism of disease is proposed to be partial loss of function (PMID: 26340332). This gene-disease relationship is also supported by mouse models, expression data, and in vitro functional assays (PMID: 19218456, 23063620, 24052814, 32203821, 32966817). In summary, there is moderate evidence to support the relationship between MEGF8 and autosomal recessive Carpenter syndrome. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged. This curation was approved by the Craniofacial Malformations Gene Curation Expert Panel on 6/17/21 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ef6ad76d-1c14-40a5-a318-bb730193bfbd","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/dd9400f1-2c0b-4ffd-989a-486b81779a53","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","changes":{"id":"cg:classificationChange"},"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/dd9400f1-2c0b-4ffd-989a-486b81779a53_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10059","date":"2021-12-23T19:30:47.075Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/dd9400f1-2c0b-4ffd-989a-486b81779a53_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10059","date":"2021-12-23T19:31:08.414Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/dd9400f1-2c0b-4ffd-989a-486b81779a53_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/dd9400f1-2c0b-4ffd-989a-486b81779a53_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b5f00da0-9986-426a-bd8a-f6f371f810a6","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e5b5adf6-9c89-4bdb-aa0a-716b0de41624","type":"Finding","dc:description":"In situ hybridization showed that Megf8 was strongly expressed in the pharyngeal arches of WT mouse embryos at embryonic days 8.5-10.5.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24052814","rdfs:label":"Expression in mouse embryo","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f41fcf63-8a94-4c1f-a787-6b7689ba3bbf","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3d0ec78f-18c7-4ca7-a247-cd23110eab8a","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Hedgehog signaling is associated with phenotypes including polydactyly, cardiac development defects, hyperterlorism, exencephaly, and heterotaxy.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32966817","rdfs:label":"Regulation of hedgehog signaling","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/dd9400f1-2c0b-4ffd-989a-486b81779a53_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9f2355a7-9cb7-4f34-8ddf-3845c1d676ee","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Downgraded for zebrafish model","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/50d3cf2a-751c-4089-8a2d-13b3ed173a60","type":"Finding","dc:description":"83% of morpholino knockdowns had epiboly defects, while only 12% of embryos with WT human MEGF8 RNA were affected. 3 missense variants observed in Carpenter syndrome patients failed to rescue the phenotype.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23063620","rdfs:label":"Rescue in zebrafish","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:PhenotypeRescue"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanRescueCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8b84b550-303d-4af9-b3ac-de45cec81e72","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Downgraded because exencephaly phenotype does not align well with craniosynotosis in humans.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/eca08eba-cfb7-4b85-9df4-28da7df6a2f9","type":"Finding","dc:description":"The two lines of mice had a similar phenotype.
