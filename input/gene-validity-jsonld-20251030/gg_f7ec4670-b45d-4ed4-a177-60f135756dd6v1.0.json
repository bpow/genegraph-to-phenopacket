This association was made using case-level and experimental data. At least 15 causative variants in this gene are reported in humans, ranging from deletions, frameshift and missense variants. Congenital prothrombin deficiency is rare and is characterized by a bleeding diathesis due to reduced Factor II activity. Mutations in F2 were first associated with this disease in humans as early as 1992 by Iwahana et al and Morishita et al. (PMID: 1334372 & 1421398).\n\nSummary of Case Level Data (12 points): The association is seen in at least 9 probands in 8 publications (PMID: 1334372, 1421398, 12149217, 12492590,  6405779, 8839854, 7740448, 16543981). Variants segregated with disease in at least 8 additional family members. More case-level evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts) has been reached.\n\nThe mechanism for disease have been reported to be biallelic loss of function. \n\nSummary of Experimental Data (5 points): Prothrombin is cleaved to yield thrombin that is essential to convert fibrin to fibrinogen for efficient clot formation. (PMID: 16006504). Mouse models that have the F2 gene knocked out show embryonic and perinatal lethality with massive hemorrhage and no clottable blood (PMID: 9636196, 9636195).   \n\nIn summary, the F2-Congenital prothrombin deficiency gene-disease relationship is definitive. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hemostasis/Thrombosis GCEP on June 24, 2020.

The authors conjecture that the free cysteine due to the variant would lead to the gene product to be sequestered intracellularly in the ER or Golgi due to improper folding. The defect could hamper the stabilization of the Ca2+-dependent conformation, which is essential for the full expression of prothrombin procoagulant activity. \n\nThis variant has also been reported in a 14-year old girl from Venezuela (Prothrombin Carora) with epistaxis, hematomas, bleeding after dental extractions and three haemoperitoneums caused by haemorrhagic corpus luteum.

It was identified in the proband and one sibling. The exon 14 variant, Gln584Ter variant resulted in premature chain termination.

Variants is CpG regions accounted for 6 out of 8 kindreds with dysprothrombinemia reported until publication of this article.  Henriksen and Mann (PMID: 3242619) showed that this defective prothrombin was minimally altered towards low molecular-weight substrates, but was markedly decreased in the release of fibrinopeptide A, aggregation of platelets and stimulation of prostacyclin release from human umbilical vein endothelium. Functional characterization of this variant showed that variant  caused a structural defect in the catalytic region of thrombin, extrinsic to which was the fibrinogen specificity site. This defect was expected to be communicated to the catalytic site as evidenced by deficits in the release of fibrinopeptide A. This variant has been reported in a number of publications (PMID: 625142, 1557383, 14489469).\n\nThe Gln584Ter variant results in a stop codon at the highly conserved residue within the thrombin coding sequence. Although this variant occurs near the carboxy terminus of the mature protein, the truncated protein was not identified immunologically or purified from the patient's plasma.

No detectable prothrombin activity was observed in blood isolated from E18.5 FII-/- embryos (PT = 16+/-2 s, failure to clot throughout 240s observation period). Intrauterine lethality was suspected due to non-Mendelian pattern of inheritance of FII allele in term offspring (1/4 of expected FII-/- were present in offspring). Mice that survived to term developed fatal bleeding events early within the neonatal period (ranging from within a few ours since birth to 2 days).\n\nFII+/− mice were found to be indistinguishable from their wild-type littermates. With the FII-/- mice, the authors observe that a subset of the FII-/- embryos suffer a developmental failure around tenth day of gestation and another subset that succeeds in traversing the risk develops to term.\n\nMinimal to large pools of blood cells were observed in the yolk sac cavity of FII-/- embryos. Embryonic vascular system was well-developed. Blood vessels in severely affected embryos were largely empty, but showed no structural changes. By ultrastructural analysis, the yolk sac vessels were well developed in all FII−/− embryos and no obvious differences in cellular structure or densities were noted.
