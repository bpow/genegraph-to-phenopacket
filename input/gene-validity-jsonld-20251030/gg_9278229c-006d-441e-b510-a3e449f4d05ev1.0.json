{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9278229c-006d-441e-b510-a3e449f4d05ev1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"The relationship between *NNT* and primary mitochondrial disease was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of July 15, 2024. The *NNT* gene encodes nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase, a pyridine nucleotide transhydrogenase found in the inner mitochondrial membrane, and catalyzes the transfer of hydride ions between NAD(H) and NADP(H). \n\n*NNT* was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive primary mitochondrial disease in 2012 (PMID: 22634753). While various names have been given to the constellation of features seen in those with *NNT*-related disorders, including glucocorticoid deficiency, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the NNT phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework.\n\nEvidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included nine variants (three missense, six nonsense or frameshift), in ten cases from ten publications (PMIDs: 22634753, 26070314, 26548497, 25459914, 38261461, 27129361, 35627102, 36478070, 26523528, 37352919). Clinical features in affected individuals include glucocorticoid deficiency, ptosis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, epilepsy and hypoglycemic seizures, developmental delay, and cardiac arrest.\n \nThe mechanism of disease is loss of function. This gene-disease association is also supported by its expression in adrenal tissue, and skeletal muscle, liver tissue, and heart, and functional alteration and rescue in non-patient cells (PMIDs: 34321199, 22634753, 36478070). Of note, there is a mouse model of this disorder showing phenotypic overlap with glucocorticoid deficiency (PMIDs: 23747984, 29046340) and a congenic mouse model shows an age-dependent effect on skeletal muscle in mice with Nnt knockout (PMID: 38795789). Evidence regarding cardiomyopathy in Nnt knockout mice is contested (PMID: 32213617) and therefore mouse cardiomyopathy phenotypes were not included in this curation.\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between *NNT* and primary mitochondrial disease. This relationship has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on July 15, 2024 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9278229c-006d-441e-b510-a3e449f4d05e","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b4e0dd90-67d0-496d-9252-5a374c53ddb9","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b4e0dd90-67d0-496d-9252-5a374c53ddb9_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2025-03-12T21:51:38.055Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b4e0dd90-67d0-496d-9252-5a374c53ddb9_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2024-07-15T04:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b4e0dd90-67d0-496d-9252-5a374c53ddb9_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b4e0dd90-67d0-496d-9252-5a374c53ddb9_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7203f9a8-7e7b-4253-8118-aeaccbe3ded2","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Score
