The condition is characterized by developmental delay,intellectual disability, tone abnormalities (mostly in the form of hypertonia or spasticity), abnormal gait, as well as seizures and/or EEG abnormalities in some individuals.\n\nTen unique missense variants, reported in 10 probands, in 5 publications (PMIDs: 29220673, 27479843, 35518358, 37921875, 38819422) are included in this curation (for a total of 7 points). \n\nThe present gene-disease relationship is further supported by experimental evidence such as biochemical evidence and data from a non-human model organism. Specifically, AMPA receptors (AMPARs) are homomeric or heteromeric assemblies of four core subunits (GluA1 - 4). GRIA1, GRIA2 and GRIA3 encoding the GluA1, GluA2 and GluA3 subunits respectively, are known to cause developmental disorders with developmental delay, intellectual disability and autistic features and seizures among the reported phenotypes (PMID: 27080385). \n\nIn a mouse model, genetic deficiency of Gria4 either in the form of reduction or complete lack of Gria4 was associated with high frequency spike wave discharges and behavioral arrest, modeling absence epilepsy. The model appeared to be more consistent with recessive inheritance mode with spike wave discharges also observed with lower incidence in the context of heterozygosity (PMID: 18316356).   \n\nIn summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has been reported.A classification of moderate was approved by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism Expert Panel GCEP on July 7, 2024 (SOP Version 10).\n\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c6f3ebfa-4a79-49fe-9221-2d62bafd9fc7","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2c6e2c49-e537-4eec-8b85-aef0c6651d55","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2c6e2c49-e537-4eec-8b85-aef0c6651d55_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2024-07-07T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2c6e2c49-e537-4eec-8b85-aef0c6651d55_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2024-10-29T13:44:59.800Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2c6e2c49-e537-4eec-8b85-aef0c6651d55_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bbf3ffa8-2daa-45ad-8429-a5b60cc93b9b","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bbf3ffa8-2daa-45ad-8429-a5b60cc93b9b_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"Effect on agonist potency: \nIn X. tropicalis oocytes expressing homomeric AMPARs either for WT GluA4 or for p.Thr639Ser, XiangWei et al. observed current responses during application of glutamate and recorded concentration-response curves for steady state responses to glutamate and kainate.
