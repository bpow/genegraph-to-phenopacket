CPT1B, like CPT1A, is a carnitine palmitoyltransferase\ninvolved in transport of long-chain fatty acyl-CoAs from the\ncytoplasm into the mitochondrial. While CPT1A is specific to the liver, CPT1B is specific to skeletal muscle.  PMID: 18023382 reported homozygous Cpt1b-deficient mice that were embryonic lethal, while heterozygous mice exhibited decreased cold tolerance and fatal hypothermia after a cold-challenge test, suggesting the possibility that variation in CPT1B could be disease-\ncausing in humans or homozygous lethal. However, no cases have been reported in the literature. No convincing evidence for a causal role for CPT1B in an inherited fatty acid metabolism disorder has been reported. \n\nThis gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the FAO GCEP on 09/25/2018.  It was reevaluated on 01/25/2021.  As a result of this reevaluation, the classification did not change as no new information is contributing to the classification.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/327109ba-6a46-4dc7-bb85-b45573fae4c5","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cfcd80c7-d806-41cf-8c3a-7ba955919537","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"NoKnownDiseaseRelationship","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cfcd80c7-d806-41cf-8c3a-7ba955919537_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10010","date":"2021-01-25T19:49:46.827Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cfcd80c7-d806-41cf-8c3a-7ba955919537_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10010","date":"2021-01-25T19:49:53.027Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cfcd80c7-d806-41cf-8c3a-7ba955919537_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cfcd80c7-d806-41cf-8c3a-7ba955919537_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cfcd80c7-d806-41cf-8c3a-7ba955919537_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1cbc7370-617c-4109-bd52-b64f0b57dbeb","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Decided not to give this model a score, since there are no genetically confirmed human phenotypes to compare the model phenotypes to.

In the current study, it took an extended challenge (4 − 6 hrs), yet significantly more CPT-1b+/− mice developed fatal hypothermia following a 6-hr cold challenge. This and the finding that 6−7% CPT-1b+/− mice verses none of the control mice had fatal hypothermia following a 3-hr cold challenge are consistent with tissue-specific expression of this enzyme in brown adipose tissue and skeletal muscle, which mediates nonshivering and shivering thermogenesis, respectively.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18023382","rdfs:label":"Cpt1b Knockout Mouse","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":0}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0}],"evidenceStrength":"NoKnownDiseaseRelationship","sequence":1915,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria7","strengthScore":0,"subject":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/wwTGayc7j6w","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0037858","gene":"hgnc:2329","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000005"},"version":"1.0","websiteLegacyID":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/assertion_cfcd80c7-d806-41cf-8c3a-7ba955919537-","@context":{"@vocab":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"},"curationReasons":{"@type":"@vocab","@container":"@set"},"GCISnapshot":{"@type":"@id"},"dc:isVersionOf":{"@type":"@id"},"websiteLegacyID":{"@type":"@id"}}}
