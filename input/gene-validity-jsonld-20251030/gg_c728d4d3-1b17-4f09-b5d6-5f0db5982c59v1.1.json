More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is known to be loss of function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by animal models, expression studies, and in vitro functional assays (PMIDs: 27896095, 10072434, 10051646, 10480371, 9685390, 9837751, 10679939). In summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *SLC22A5* and  autosomal recessive systemic primary carnitine deficiency disease. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Fatty Acid Oxidation Disorders GCEP on April 24th, 2018 (SOP Version 5).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c728d4d3-1b17-4f09-b5d6-5f0db5982c59","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2beee8a9-193c-41ca-92c4-484c8e034b02","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":[{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},{"id":"cg:sopChange"},{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"}],"contributions":[{"agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10097","role":"SecondaryContributor"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2beee8a9-193c-41ca-92c4-484c8e034b02_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10010","date":"2018-04-24T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2beee8a9-193c-41ca-92c4-484c8e034b02_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10010","date":"2025-08-04T00:34:13.827Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["ErrorClarification"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2beee8a9-193c-41ca-92c4-484c8e034b02_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2beee8a9-193c-41ca-92c4-484c8e034b02_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/62e32fe2-161f-4229-96a3-3bd2bcd8304e","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/adc0c4e1-a97c-4fb4-9f78-2fb72d02528a","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Northern blotting with poly(A)+ RNA from a wide range of normal human tissues, using a labeled OCTN2 cDNA fragment, revealed high OCTN2 expression in tissues including skeletal muscle, kidney, placenta, and heart.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9685390","rdfs:label":"Tamai1998 Expression","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c5e30cdf-a4a4-4b79-80b3-23bb75b0b657","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bac7f81c-9936-408d-9fe4-a460ed4c3054","type":"Finding","dc:description":"The ratio of OCTN2/actin counts was reduced to ≈25% of control cells in fibroblasts from patients 10665 and 2996.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10051646","rdfs:label":"Wang1999","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionB"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e25295d2-cfcd-4a8c-a080-39cd8ec97620","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0a8cdfc1-5b24-4448-993f-1876313c0ce0","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Primary carnitine deficiency is thought to be due to a defect of active transport of carnitine across plasma membranes.
