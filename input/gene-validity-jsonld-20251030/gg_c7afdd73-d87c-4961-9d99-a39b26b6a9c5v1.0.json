Variants in BCKDHB were first reported in humans with this disease as early as 1991 (Nobukuni et al., PMID 2022752). At least 15 variants ( missense, nonsense, frameshift) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes  case-level and experimental data. Approximately 35% of maple syrup urine disease cases can be attributed to pathogenic variants in BCKDHB (Strauss et al., 2006, PMID 20301495).  More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. This gene-disease association is supported by biochemical and in vitro assays. In summary, BCKDHB is definitively associated with autosomal recessive maple syrup urine disease. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic\nsettings, and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c7afdd73-d87c-4961-9d99-a39b26b6a9c5","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0b0d314c-7355-441c-a357-72ba3e566c57","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0b0d314c-7355-441c-a357-72ba3e566c57_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10011","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0b0d314c-7355-441c-a357-72ba3e566c57_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10011","date":"2019-02-08T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0b0d314c-7355-441c-a357-72ba3e566c57_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0b0d314c-7355-441c-a357-72ba3e566c57_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/93bbbcb2-9103-4724-8296-f14e085962cf","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"E1 component of the BCKD complex carrying a missense variant was expressed in E. coli.","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/dfeba9e5-977a-47a1-b10d-458972469d1a","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"\"The activity of the BCKD complex (Reaction 1) reconstituted with stoichiometric amounts of E1, E2, and E3 components was measured using α-keto[1-14C]isovalerate as a substrate.\"  A substitution of wild type E1 with H156Y variant showed no BCKD activity in the presence of normal E2 and E3.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14742428","rdfs:label":"Activity of BCKD Complex"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0b0d314c-7355-441c-a357-72ba3e566c57_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bf3dc72b-75ec-499e-a50f-c08b6ce073cb","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The second major step in catabolism of branched-chain amino acids is catalyzed by the branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complex that consists of 3 subunits- E1a, E1b and E2.
