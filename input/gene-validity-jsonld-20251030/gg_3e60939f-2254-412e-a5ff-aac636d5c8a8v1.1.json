FOP is characterized by heterotopic ossification and malformed big toes. Nine missense variants and one indel variant that have been reported in 15 probands in seven publications (PMIDs: 16642017, 18203193, 19085907, 18830232, 21044902, 34347384, 36060212) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is reported to be gain of function. This gene-disease association is also supported by protein-protein interactions, expression data, mouse and zebrafish models, and functional alteration of patient cells (PMIDs: 22977237, 22508565, 26626181, 29307777). In summary, ACVR1 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Skeletal Disorders GCEP on 3/1/23 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3e60939f-2254-412e-a5ff-aac636d5c8a8","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0439e75f-fc1b-4841-8c9a-17f3568ce8a4","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0439e75f-fc1b-4841-8c9a-17f3568ce8a4_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10065","date":"2023-03-01T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0439e75f-fc1b-4841-8c9a-17f3568ce8a4_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10065","date":"2024-01-22T17:49:04.471Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0439e75f-fc1b-4841-8c9a-17f3568ce8a4_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0439e75f-fc1b-4841-8c9a-17f3568ce8a4_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b84273c9-8c48-4960-b2a4-d4264ba2e625","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6b413fcd-7f69-4278-b762-dcc10d523080","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Chaikuad et al. 2012 also looked at representative expression levels for transfected ALK2 (ACVR1 legacy name) constructs with variants found in humans with FOP.
