{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/dd85cd3a-fdb6-459b-8bc2-d7d3e61dcef3v1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"Individuals with monoallelic variants in the *RANBP2* gene and features of acute necrotizing encephalopathy (ANE) were first reported in the literature in 2009 (Neilson et al., PMID:19118815). ANE is characterized by a variable presentation of encephalopathy, seizures and potential coma shortly after infection in otherwise healthy and cognitively typical individuals. ANE is also notable for characteristic MRI findings of polyfocal lesions in the thalami, pons and brainstem. Of note, there have been additional individuals reported with *RANBP2* variants in large autism cohorts (PMIDs: 35982160, 28714951). Due to limited phenotypic information about these individuals, we are opting not to include them in this curation for ANE.\n\nIn multiple reports of patients with ANE and variants in *RANBP2*, a recurrent p.Thr585Met (c.1880C>T) variant is present. This variant has been identified as de novo in some individuals with ANE and has also been identified to segregate with disease in some families (PMIDs: 19118815, 19811512, 20570537, 21945312, 26110162, 34377735). Although typically found in the heterozygous state, at least one publication identifies an individual with disease who carries this variant in the homozygous state (PMID: 36029610). Other missense variants are present in individuals with disease, but with limited additional evidence (PMID:19118815, 20473521, 25170550). No experimental data supporting a relationship between *RANBP2* and ANE has been included in this curation. Of note, given the low penetrance associated with this condition, additional supporting data is needed to further establish a conclusive gene-disease relationship.\n\nIn summary, there is moderate evidence to support the relationship between *RANBP2* and acute necrotizing encephalopathy. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Epilepsy GCEP on the meeting date April 2, 2024 (SOP Version 10).
