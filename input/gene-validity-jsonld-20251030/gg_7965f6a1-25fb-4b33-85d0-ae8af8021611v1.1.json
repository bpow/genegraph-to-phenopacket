Homozygous or compound heterozygous pathogenic variants in BRCA1 have been reported to be associated with FANCS. In total, eight affected individuals with FANCS from six unrelated families were curated here. All three adult probands have breast or ovarian cancer diagnosed before age of 30 (PMID: 23269703; 25472942; 31347298). Two out of five younger probands were diagnosed with cancer: one with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia at age 5 and one with neuroblastoma at age 2 (PMID:29712865). BRCA1, BRIP1, RAD51C, PALB2 have also been established as FA genes in the FA/BRCA DNA repair pathway. Multiple reports of functional assays using patients cells have consistent/similar results. For example, Sawyer SL, et al., 2015 (PMID: 25472942) indicated patient primary skin fibroblast cells showed reduced BRCA1 and Rad51 foci formation at IR induced damage sites and exhibited deficiency in DSB recognition. Rescue studies of PARP inhibition by Olaparib were also reported. In summary, BRCA1 is definitively associated with the autosomal recessive FANCS disorder. This has been demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7965f6a1-25fb-4b33-85d0-ae8af8021611","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/aa39798d-9b6e-430d-8bc1-2a01f81f1f72","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/aa39798d-9b6e-430d-8bc1-2a01f81f1f72_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10023","date":"2020-05-14T00:31:37.538Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/aa39798d-9b6e-430d-8bc1-2a01f81f1f72_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10023","date":"2020-09-16T19:22:58.236Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/aa39798d-9b6e-430d-8bc1-2a01f81f1f72_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/aa39798d-9b6e-430d-8bc1-2a01f81f1f72_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0df5af10-3b21-4446-9597-e6dff37d50ea","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"0.5 point for each genes (BRCA2, PALB2, BRIP1 and RAD51C)","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2042e22b-275c-427c-927f-c74a240e6046","type":"Finding","dc:description":"BRCA1, BRCA2, BRIP1, RAD51C and PALB2 have been established as FA genes. \nBRCA1 is a component of a large nuclear protein complex, consisting of at least three other bonafide FA proteins, BRCA2 (FANCD1), PALB2 (FANCN), and BRIP1 (FANCJ).\nPALB2 binds to the extreme N terminus of BRCA2 and he C-terminal BCRT repeats of BRCA1, and BRCA1, in turn, binds directly to BRIP1 (J) .
