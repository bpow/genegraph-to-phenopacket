The disorder is characterized by developmental delay with significant speech and language delay, mild to severe intellectual disability, behavioral disorders including autism, hyperphagia, obesity or overweight, and dysmorphic features. Other variable features include hypotonia, seizures, and brain MRI abnormalities. Individuals with 2p25.3 deletions encompassing *MYT1L* exhibit an overlapping phenotype, indicating that *MYT1L* is the causal gene (PMID: 2523284).\n \nAt least ten unique *MYT1L* sequence variants have been reported. Eight unique variants (nonsense, frameshift, splice site, and missense) that have been reported in eight probands in four publications (PMIDs: 23033978, 25232846, 28859103, 30055078) are included in this curation. All variants occurred *de novo*. The mechanism of pathogenicity is loss of function. \n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by animal models and *in vitro* functional assays. Mall et al. (2017, PMID: 28379941) showed that acute knockdown of *Myt1l* in the mouse brain mimicked a Notch gain-of-function phenotype, predicting that the gene allows newborn neurons to escape Notch activation during normal development. Myt1l depletion in primary postmitotic neurons de-repressed non-neuronal programs and impaired neuronal gene expression and function. This indicated that many somatic lineage programs are actively and persistently repressed by Myt1l to maintain neuronal identity. Shi et al. (2018, PMID: 29397565) investigated Myt1l expression in rat oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPC). Overexpression of Myt1L promoted, while Myt1l knockdown inhibited OPC differentiation. Moreover, Myt1L was potently involved in promoting remyelination after lysolecithin-induced demyelination *in vivo*. ChIP assays showed that Myt1L bound to the promoter of Olig1 and transcriptionally regulated its expression. \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *MYT1L* and autosomal dominant syndromic intellectual disability. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel on August 18, 2020 (SOP Version 7). ","Variants in the MYT1L gene were first reported in relation to autosomal dominant Intellectual disability in 2007 (de Ligt et al., PMID: 23033978), and the authors reported one de novo splice site variant. At least ten unique variants have been reported in humans, and autosomal dominant ID is characterized by mildly to severely impaired intellectual development including difficulties with speech and language. Individuals showed variable clinical features such as hyperphagia, facial dysmorphism, and hypotonia. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. \n\nCase level data: \nMYT1L variants have been reported in at least ten probands in four publications (PMIDs: 23033978, 25232846, 28859103, 30055078). Publications reported putative LOF (i.e. deletions, nonsense, splice site) variants and some missense variants. \n\nExperimental data:\nThe relationship between MYT1L and autosomal dominant ID is supported by animal models and in vitro functional assays. Mall et al. 2017 (PMID: 28379941) showed that acute knockdown of Myt1l in the mouse brain mimicked a Notch gain-of-function phenotype, predicting that the gene allows newborn neurons to escape Notch activation during normal development. Also, Myt1l depletion in primary postmitotic neurons de-repressed non-neuronal programs and impaired neuronal gene expression and function. This indicated that many somatic lineage programs are actively and persistently repressed by Myt1l to maintain neuronal identity. Shi et al. 2018 (PMID: 29397565) investigated Myt1l expression in rat oligodendrocyte precursor cells. Overexpression of Myt1L promoted, while Myt1l knockdown inhibited OPC differentiation. Moreover, Myt1L was potently involved in promoting remyelination after lysolecithin-induced demyelination in vivo. ChIP assays showed that Myt1L bound to the promoter of Olig1 and transcriptionally regulated its expression. \n\nIn summary, MYT1L is definitively associated with autosomal dominant intellectual disability, and there is an abundance of evidence to support this association."],"dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4be69cb8-99ca-4793-9774-32e7b1d1c19c","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/32897f25-e36a-4ec8-9401-0374a95e06a5","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/32897f25-e36a-4ec8-9401-0374a95e06a5_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":["2020-08-17T22:00:00.000Z","2020-08-18T16:00:00.000Z"],"role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/32897f25-e36a-4ec8-9401-0374a95e06a5_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2025-08-06T14:50:50.448Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["ErrorClarification"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/32897f25-e36a-4ec8-9401-0374a95e06a5_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/32897f25-e36a-4ec8-9401-0374a95e06a5_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ec4d9afa-4a33-42c5-84d3-be894a648096","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/87131008-2248-4430-a191-2ce9463f4aae","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"In primary cultured OPCs, overexpression of Myt1L promoted, while knockdown inhibited OPC differentiation.
