Conversly, Thrombocytopenia, congenital amegakaryocytic and Thrombocytopenia 9 were considered a single disease entity with semidominant inheritance resulting in milder thrombocytopenia in monoallelic individuals and more severe disease in biallelic cases.\n\n*THPO* was first reported in relation to congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia inherited in a semidominant manner in 2013 (Dasouki et al., PMID: 24085763) in a Micronesian family.\n \nNonsense, missense and frameshift variants have been reported in humans thus far. The disease mechanism is loss of function. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes genetic evidence (case-level data) and experimental evidence (biochemical functions, protein interaction and animal model).\n\nSummary of Case Level Data: 12 points: Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 12 probands in 7 publications (PMIDs: 29191945, 24085763, 28559357, 36226497, 28466964, 32150607, 36534659)\n\nSummary of Experimental Data: 5.5 points: This gene-disease relationship is supported by in vitro functional assays. *THPO* is involved in megakaryopoiesis and thrombopoiesis, and loss of function variants in *THPO* lead to decrease in platelet counts (PMID: 23594368). Chen et al. showed that *THPO* physically interacts with MPL. (PMID: 20529857). A knock-out mouse model was generated by Sauvage et al, wherein homozygous KO mice recapitulated the thrombocytopenia phenotype while the heterozygous mice showed a significant reduction in platelet counts (PMID: 8627177). Additionally, CRISPR/Cas9 generated loss of function thpo-szy6 zebrafish had significant reduction of thpo expression and developed thrombocytopenia, as in humans (PMID: 35622056).\n\nIn summary, there is Definitive evidence to support the gene-disease relationship of *THPO* and autosomal recessive congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.\n\nThis gene-disease pair was originally approved by the Hemostatis and Thrombosis GCEP on March 29, 2022. It was re-evaluated on May 01, 2024. As a result of this reevaluation, the classification increased from Moderate to Definitive with the addition of two probands (PMIDs: 36226497, 36534659) and a new zebrafish model (PMID: 35622056). Of note, the previous instance scored only the autosomal recessive cases but the evidence for a semidominant inheritance was considered sufficeint to update on re-evaluation.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1e4bcb18-cef0-400a-b5f5-df0c2fb4ab55","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1cc3bbfe-9347-4514-916a-15b5db0129bb","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1cc3bbfe-9347-4514-916a-15b5db0129bb_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2024-05-01T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1cc3bbfe-9347-4514-916a-15b5db0129bb_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2024-05-20T17:16:10.290Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["RecurationTiming","RecurationNewEvidence"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1cc3bbfe-9347-4514-916a-15b5db0129bb_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9152b189-deee-4c69-8874-092c4a770369_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/40a1e4ae-35eb-4f1a-8c6d-5328d1bccd18","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"recurrent variant","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/40a1e4ae-35eb-4f1a-8c6d-5328d1bccd18_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"Functional studies in HEK293T cells revealed that though overall concentration of TPO was similar to WT, the variant protein showed perinuclear localization, suggesting mistrafficking.","functionalDataSupport":"No"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/40a1e4ae-35eb-4f1a-8c6d-5328d1bccd18_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32150607","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5b190301-2478-4c91-96c9-e252c975d80f","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000460.4(THPO):c.295C>T (p.Arg99Trp)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA355462815"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:MonoallelicHeterozygous"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":0.1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9152b189-deee-4c69-8874-092c4a770369","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32150607","rdfs:label":"Cornish_Pedigree C_II-1","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5b190301-2478-4c91-96c9-e252c975d80f"},"detectionMethod":"Proband was enrolled into the National Institute for Health Research BioResource for Rare Diseases or referred for analysis with the ThromboGenomics high-throughput diagnostic platform","phenotypeFreeText":"Mean serum TPO was 42 pg/ml (NV = 17-57).
