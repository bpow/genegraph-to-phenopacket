More than 500 unique variants (missense, in-frame indel, nonsense, frameshift, large deletions) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level, case-control, segregation and experimental data.\nSummary of case-level data: 12 points. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 16 probands in 2 publications (PMID:10903931, PMID:10973254). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 10 additional family members. More evidence is available in the literature but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. The mechanism is haploinsufficiency (PMID:11115378, PMID: 16429395).\nSummary of experimental data: 6 points. This gene-disease association is supported by expression, biochemical, in vitro functional and animal model data. In summary, BMPR2 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant pulmonary arterial hypertension. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both research and diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen PH Working Group on Sept 9, 2020.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/331df7bc-f92b-4244-bacd-5f70b1b84bd4","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a20ce78b-18ba-436c-877e-a08d092ac7c7","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a20ce78b-18ba-436c-877e-a08d092ac7c7_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10071","date":"2020-12-07T17:23:18.621Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a20ce78b-18ba-436c-877e-a08d092ac7c7_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10071","date":"2021-01-11T14:58:03.656Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a20ce78b-18ba-436c-877e-a08d092ac7c7_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a20ce78b-18ba-436c-877e-a08d092ac7c7_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/49c17383-9297-4708-a3fc-29d61637310e","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d73f52f0-4c7b-4270-a74a-57798dc09ee3","type":"Finding","dc:description":"1) The main pathogenic mechanism of BMPR2 variants in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is haploinsufficiency (loss of one gene copy); the heterozygous knockout mouse model mimics this condition. 2) BMPR2 variants are causal for pediatric PAH as well as adult-onset disease, and BMPR2 has a known role in embryonic development. Homozygosity for the Bmpr2 knockout allele is embryonic lethal with all mice dying in utero. In this study, haploinsufficiency led to 20% fatality in utero or perinatally. 3) PAH is clinically characterized by elevated pulmonary artery pressures leading to right ventricular hypertrophy, heart failure and premature death. In the absence of pulmonary valve disease, right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) is equivalent to the pulmonary artery systolic pressure. Right heart catheterization, used in this study, is the gold standard for measuring RVSP. Bmpr2+/- mice exhibited normal RVSP under basal conditions but a moderate increase in response to acute pulmonary inflammation (intra-tracheal adenoviral delivery of 5-lipoxygenase) compared to wild-type controls (Figure 5). 4) Pathogenic remodeling of the pulmonary vasculature, including distal pulmonary arteries, is a hallmark of PAH. Three weeks after the peak in RVSP, Bmpr2+/- mice exhibited increased muscularization of distal pulmonary vessels by alpha-actin immunohistochemistry compare to controls. Thus, while Bmpr2+/- mice did not develop PH under unstressed conditions, they did develop increased RVSP and distal vessel remodelling in response to acute inflammation.\n\n*NOTE: Similar data have been reported for endothelial-specific BMPR2 KO mice (PMID: 18663089) and transgenic mice with conditional expression of a dominant negative mutant BMPRII (PMID:15031260).
