(1996). Multiple case level studies have been performed with WS patients that have variants in the WRN gene. There are currently 85 different mutations recorded in Werner Syndrome Mutational Database. BLM and RECQL4, another two RecQ DNA helicases, are associated with Bloom and Rothmund–Thomson syndromes. All three are disorders of chromosomal instability and manifest growth retardation, and predisposition to malignancies. Fibroblasts from individuals with Werner Syndrome have accelerated telomere attrition and undergo premature senescence that can be rescued by enforced expression of Tert. Multiple WRN deficient mouse models have been established to show consistent phenotypes with WS patients, including premature death, hair graying, alopecia, osteoporosis, type II diabetes and cataracts. All of these types of evidence are consistent with a definitive relationship between the WRN gene and Werner Syndrome (WS).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/926d904d-330a-424f-969a-af72095b4eb6","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d9c04f29-bc94-40c5-95d7-d25d21cd387f","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d9c04f29-bc94-40c5-95d7-d25d21cd387f_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10023","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d9c04f29-bc94-40c5-95d7-d25d21cd387f_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10023","date":"2018-10-09T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d9c04f29-bc94-40c5-95d7-d25d21cd387f_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d9c04f29-bc94-40c5-95d7-d25d21cd387f_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e6cd176b-6f06-4de4-a976-6bf04f6cd17a","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c851b36b-dff9-4e96-a39e-30f6839e170c","type":"Finding","dc:description":"In late-generation mice null with respect to both Wrn and Terc (encoding the telomerase RNA component), telomere dysfunction elicits a classical Werner like premature aging syndrome typified by premature death, hair graying, alopecia, osteoporosis, type II diabetes and cataracts.
