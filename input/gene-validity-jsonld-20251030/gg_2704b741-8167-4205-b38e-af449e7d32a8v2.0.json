The JPH2 gene has been associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in 16 probands in 5 publications. Six unique heterozygous variants (missense), with some evidence to support their pathogenicity, have been reported in humans (Landstrom et al, 2007, PMID 17509612; Beavers et al, 2013, PMID 23973696; Bongini et al, 2016, PMID 26869393; Quick et al, 2017, PMID 28393127; Vanninen et al, 2018  PMID:30235249). The mechanism for disease remains unknown. The gene-disease association is supported by expression studies, in vitro assays, and animal models. There is considerable background noise, which should be considered in variant interpretation (Jones et al, 2019, PMID 31227780). The Thr161Lys variant has been identified in 9 Finnish families and has emerged as a potential Finnish founder variant; further evidence regarding the ancestry of affected individuals is necessary to confirm or refute the role of Finnish ethnicity. In 2017, the ClinGen HCM GCEP classified the JPH2 gene to the moderate evidence category for monogenic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. This gene-disease relationship was originally  approved by the ClinGen Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Gene Curation Expert Panel on July 18, 2017. In summary, as in the initial curation, the re-curation showed moderate evidence to support the causal association of JPH2 in monogenic HCM. While more evidence is needed to establish this association definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged. This gene-disease relationship was reevaluated and approved on October 12, 2022 by the Hereditary Cardiovascular Disorders GCEP. As a result of this reevaluation, the classification remains MODERATE.
