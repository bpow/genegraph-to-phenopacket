Sixteen variants (12 missense, 2 frameshift, 1 exonic deletion, 1 splice region) that have been reported in 17 probands in three publications (PMIDs: 23647072, 25644381, 27550844) are included in this curation. Variants in this gene segregated with disease in additional family members. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by functional alterations and rescue experiments in mouse neurons following *Clcn4* knockdown.\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *CLCN4* and non-syndromic X-linked intellectual disability. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel on October 20, 2017 (SOP Version 5).","Classification remains Definitive despite updates to segregation scoring (SOP v\n.5). \nWith combined LOD scores >6 (variants\nidentified through X-chromosome exome sequencing), the maximum segregation score of 3 is appropriate."],"dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8d446ca7-f649-40dd-8027-697ec812e2c1","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/54fbcbc8-77d7-4496-8527-1171cdd7452c","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/54fbcbc8-77d7-4496-8527-1171cdd7452c_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2025-08-18T08:35:21.059Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/54fbcbc8-77d7-4496-8527-1171cdd7452c_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":["2017-10-20T10:00:00.000Z","2017-10-20T16:00:00.000Z"],"role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["ErrorClarification"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/54fbcbc8-77d7-4496-8527-1171cdd7452c_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/54fbcbc8-77d7-4496-8527-1171cdd7452c_seg_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a23350d3-9bb2-4ba3-bde0-9a53955960d2_proband_segregation","type":"FamilyCosegregation","dc:description":"Family does not reach threshold of 4 segregations.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27550844","rdfs:label":"Palmer Family J","estimatedLodScore":0.6,"family":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a23350d3-9bb2-4ba3-bde0-9a53955960d2","type":"Family","rdfs:label":"Palmer Family J","ethnicity":{"id":"cg:HispanicOrLatino"},"member":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6f3e8005-0724-4876-a110-96bea3f77d50","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27550844","rdfs:label":"Palmer Proband J","detectionMethod":"Proband was assessed via clinical cytogenomic microarray (CMA v. 10.2) at Baylor Miraca.","ethnicity":{"id":"cg:HispanicOrLatino"},"phenotypeFreeText":"The younger brother in this family is being considered the proband for ClinGen gene curation purposes.","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0002072","obo:HP_0000252","obo:HP_0001288","obo:HP_0008947","obo:HP_0001250","obo:HP_0012448","obo:HP_0010864"],"previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"Per the supplementary material: \"Non-diagnostic genetic and metabolic investigations for the younger brother include acylcarnitine profile, uric acid, urine organic acids, vitamin E level, very long chain fatty acids, copper, ceruloplasmin, and karyotype.\"","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/38b910bd-78f3-404d-aaa6-5bbb6d6f5f8c_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27550844","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2b020048-9154-42b6-b9ff-83035ff26d4b","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"GRCh37/hg19 Xp22.2(chrX:10187807-10189796)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/209114"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"}}}},"meetsInclusionCriteria":false,"phenotypeFreeText":"From the supplementary material: \"This is a previously unreported family.
