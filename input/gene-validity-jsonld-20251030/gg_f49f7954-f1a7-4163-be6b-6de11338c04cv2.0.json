Indviduals reported with the disorder all share extra-oral halitosis with a specific \"cabbage-like\"odor caused by elevated levels of methanethiol and dimethylsulfide in the breath. Additionally, indviduals with the disorder demonstrate reduced SELENBP1 protien levels and methanethiol oxidase activity. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. At least 2 variants (nonsense and splicing) have been reported in 2 probands from 1 publication (PMID:29255262). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 1 additional family member. The gene *SELENBP1* encodes an enzyme that serves as a methanethiol oxidase, converting methanethiol, oxygen, and water to formaldehyde, hydrogen sulfide, and hydrogen peroxide. \n\nThis gene-disease association is further supported by its biochemical function as a methane oxidase in kinetic assays (PMID:29255262) and a knockout mouse model (PMID:29255262) which recapitulates the phenotype of evelated DMS levels in plasma and DMSO2 with decreased Methane Oxidase activity. Additionally, Bulk tissue expression data from the GTEx project demonstrates that *SELENBP1* is primary expressed in the transverse colon, supporting its function as a methane oxidase as methanethiol is produced in the large intestine. Finally, in nonpatient cells, variants of *SELENBP1* were found to have loss and impairment of Methanethiol oxidase function as indicated by little to no detectable H2S and H2O2 generation (PMIDs:33901808, 37437449). In summary, *SELENBP1* is moderately associated with autosomal recessive extraoral halitosis due to methanethiol oxidase deficiency.\n\nThis gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the Aminoacidopathy GCEP on November 11, 2022.  It was reevaluated on December 6th, 2024. As a result of this reevaluation, new experimental evidence (PMID: 37437449) was added and the classification did not change.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f49f7954-f1a7-4163-be6b-6de11338c04c","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fcd063e5-93af-47d2-a59d-3fef995df556","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","changes":[{"id":"cg:sopChange"},{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"},{"id":"cg:newEvidence"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fcd063e5-93af-47d2-a59d-3fef995df556_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10011","date":"2025-01-21T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fcd063e5-93af-47d2-a59d-3fef995df556_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10011","date":"2025-01-22T14:54:20.280Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["RecurationTiming","RecurationNewEvidence"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fcd063e5-93af-47d2-a59d-3fef995df556_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fcd063e5-93af-47d2-a59d-3fef995df556_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a69e082b-fd5a-471e-9f2e-215d83d3fc2a","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4afd25a1-e136-48c9-a8be-9c093686e788","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Bulk tissue expression data from the GTEx project demonstrates that SELENBP1 is primary expressed in the transverse colon.
