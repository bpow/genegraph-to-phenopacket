Initial reports of LCAD deficient patients (PMIDs 1945557 and 4022672) were subsequently found to have a VLCAD deficiency and/or no pathogenic LCAD variants were identified. More recent reports (PMID 24591516) suggest that LCAD deficiency may manifest primarily as pulmonary disease, however the only identified variant remains a common polymorphism (Lys333Gln) for which there is some evidence of a functional impact (PMID 32389575). In summary, there is convincing evidence disputing the relationship between ACADL and autosomal recessive long chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency. More evidence is needed to either support or refute the role ACADL\nplays in this disease.\n\nThis gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the FAO GCEP on 09/25/2018.  It was reevaluated on 01/15/2021 and 03/07/2024.  As a result of this reevaluation, the classification did not change as no new information is contributing to the classification.\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/edeafda6-1699-4f43-adc3-9e783a8fe841","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d95637bf-c628-4d23-a0d5-656db55a09a4","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"NoKnownDiseaseRelationship","changes":[{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"},{"id":"cg:sopChange"},{"id":"cg:summaryChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d95637bf-c628-4d23-a0d5-656db55a09a4_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10010","date":"2024-04-25T20:53:54.784Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d95637bf-c628-4d23-a0d5-656db55a09a4_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10010","date":"2024-04-25T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"Initial reports of LCAD deficient patients (PMIDs 1945557 and 4022672) were subsequently found to have a VLCAD deficiency and/or no pathogenic LCAD variants were identified.
