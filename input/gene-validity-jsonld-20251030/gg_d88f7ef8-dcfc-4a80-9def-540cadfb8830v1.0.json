At least 13 unique variants (nonsense and frameshift) have been identified in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 13 probands in at least 5 publications (PMID: 8640223, 27017278, 26938784, 15725586, 30232666). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism for disease is haploinsufficiency. This gene-disease association is supported by animal models, functional alterations in patient cells, and expression studies. In summary, MTM1 is definitively associated with X-linked centronuclear myopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d88f7ef8-dcfc-4a80-9def-540cadfb8830","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2b60f008-871f-4c5f-aa46-099d09fb66df","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2b60f008-871f-4c5f-aa46-099d09fb66df_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10031","date":"2019-11-22T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2b60f008-871f-4c5f-aa46-099d09fb66df_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10031","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2b60f008-871f-4c5f-aa46-099d09fb66df_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2b60f008-871f-4c5f-aa46-099d09fb66df_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7ea33192-910e-42f6-9df1-3b3e54a92767","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c732bd80-bd06-42be-8825-3d1d6b61e424","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Both humans and zebra fish exhibit skeletal muscle abnormalities and specific nucelar structures and T-tubule disorganization is seen in both models.
