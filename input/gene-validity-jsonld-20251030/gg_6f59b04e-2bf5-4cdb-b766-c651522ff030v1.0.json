A single homozygous variant in UQCRQ has been reported in humans with Leigh syndrome spectrum in a single publication in 2008 (PMID: 18439546). The homozygous variant reported in this publication (PMID: 18439546) demonstrated complete penetrance in more than 20 affected individuals in a large consanguineous Israeli Bedouin kindred. Evidence supporting the gene-disease relationship between UQCRQ and Leigh syndrome spectrum includes case-level data of one proband and segregation data from the 2008 study. This gene-disease association is further supported by UQCRQ protein expression in brain. As there is currently only one publication demonstrating UQCRQ’s role in human disease, there is limited evidence to support the relationship between UQCRQ and autosomal recessive Leigh syndrome spectrum. This classification was approved by the NICHD U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on October 14, 2019 (SOP Version 7).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6f59b04e-2bf5-4cdb-b766-c651522ff030","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9bf205a2-6eb3-40aa-b3dd-54c19ce6e6f7","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9bf205a2-6eb3-40aa-b3dd-54c19ce6e6f7_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2019-10-16T14:46:56.909Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9bf205a2-6eb3-40aa-b3dd-54c19ce6e6f7_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9bf205a2-6eb3-40aa-b3dd-54c19ce6e6f7_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/39ae2ff7-d9f4-46ad-84e7-5f27031abce6_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Three-dimensional modeling of the Bovine Mitochondrial bc1 Complex17 (which contains the UQCRQ homolog) suggests that the Ser45 lies at a critical hinge position likely determining the orientation of the extramembrane domain of the molecule.18 Thus, we assume that an amino acid that is significantly structurally different at this position alters the orientation of this extramembrane domain.","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/06a043f6-bc8d-49bf-b085-08f99953f8b7","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18439546","rdfs:label":"Pedigree C Individual 133","ageType":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/","ageUnit":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/","detectionMethod":"sequence analysis  of UQCRQ revealedac.208C/ Tmutation in exon 2, replacing serine at position 45 by phenylalanine (p.Ser45Phe) in the encoded protein, UQCRQ , complex III subunit VII, 9.5 kDa.","firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"Brain MRI consistent with a diagnosis of Leigh syndrome.
