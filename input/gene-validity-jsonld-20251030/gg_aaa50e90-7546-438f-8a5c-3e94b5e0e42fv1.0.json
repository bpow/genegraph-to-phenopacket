MHC class II molecules are essential for the presentation of exogenous peptides to CD4+ helper T cells and thus in the adaptive immune response. Mutations in four trans-acting genes *CIITA,* *RFXANK,* *RFX5,* and *RFXAP* are responsible for the primary immunodeficiency. Pathogenic variants in RFX5 are associated with BLS complementation group C.Affected individuals typically present in infancy with severe, recurrent infections, failure to thrive, low levels of CD4+ T cells, and undetectable undetectable MHC class II (e.g., HLA DR) expression on monocytes and B cells. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be bialleleic loss of function. Heterozygous carriers of *RFX5* loss of function variants are not reported to be clinically affected. \nThe *RFX5* curation includes 8 variants (frameshift, nonsense, missense, and splice site) reported in 8 probands from 6 publications (PMIDs: 7744245, 9401005, 10079298, 12368908, 30084052, 29527204). Additional evidence is available however the maximum score for genetic evidence was reached. This gene-disease association is supported by experimental evidence including its biochemical function, as part of the RFX complex, of binding DNA in a X1-box-spiceifc manner to allow for transcriptional activation of MHC class II molecules (PMID: 10938133). The MHC class II deficiency can be rescued in patient cells by expression of wildtype *RFX5* (PMID: 7744245 ). Furthermore, it interacts with the transactivator *CIITA,* which is also implicated in MHC class II deficiency (PMID: 10938133). Additionally, RFX5−/− mice exhibit an immune deficiency that is very similar to that of MHC-II–deficient patients (PMID: 9491996).  In summary, *RFX5* is definitively associated with autosomal recessive MHC class II deficiency. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both research and the clinical diagnostic setting and has been upheld over time. \n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/aaa50e90-7546-438f-8a5c-3e94b5e0e42f","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/430c4041-5e07-45d8-bea5-eaa925a18a72","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/430c4041-5e07-45d8-bea5-eaa925a18a72_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10081","date":"2023-06-15T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/430c4041-5e07-45d8-bea5-eaa925a18a72_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10081","date":"2023-06-20T17:11:58.734Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/430c4041-5e07-45d8-bea5-eaa925a18a72_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fa8b0e70-7152-435e-8e8a-520ec728e579_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/327f8784-8fad-40ce-a821-0131bfc2f0d6","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The variant is homozygous in this Indian patient, however the parents are reported as not related.

RFX5−/− mice failed to produce measurable NP-specific IgM following immunization with NP-CG, similar to the result observed with Aβ−/− mice. Compared to RFX5+/− controls, RFX5−/− mice produced 100- to 1000-fold reduced levels of NP-specific IgG1 in the course of the secondary response. In contrast to the TD response, RFX5−/− mice responded to the TI antigen NP-Ficoll with normal titers of IgM and IgG3, indicating that there is no intrinsic defect in RFX5-deficient B cells for becoming immunoglobulin-producing plasma cells.
