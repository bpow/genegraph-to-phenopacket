Three unique missense variant proved to affect the protein function by patch clamp analysis (Aridon et al., Conti et al., Vila et al.). The variant in this gene was identified by linkage analysis followed by Sanger sequencing, and segregated with disease in 9 additional family members. In summary, there is limited evidence to support the CHRNA2 and nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy association. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Epilepsy Gene Curation Expert Panel by 1/7/2020.\n\nLumping and Splitting: Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found differences in phenotypic variability between three disease entities: (1) Nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (MONDO:0000030), (2) Idiopathic epilepsy (MONDO:0005579) and (3) Benign familial infantile seizure (MONDO:0011140). Therefore, we have split curations for the disease entities, (1) Nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (MONDO:0000030), (2) Idiopathic epilepsy (MONDO:0005579) and (3) Benign familial infantile seizure (MONDO:0011140).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a1947a82-b848-4f14-97ce-a20687f194f2","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0f832b8a-af5a-494e-bfdb-70cc619addf1","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0f832b8a-af5a-494e-bfdb-70cc619addf1_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10005","date":"2020-12-25T01:57:18.905Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0f832b8a-af5a-494e-bfdb-70cc619addf1_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10005","date":"2020-12-25T01:56:52.186Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0f832b8a-af5a-494e-bfdb-70cc619addf1_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0f832b8a-af5a-494e-bfdb-70cc619addf1_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5a0c967a-dd3a-4b07-993e-bbf49669e552","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cffe56dd-7a45-424a-ad15-ed4b09f53e4f","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Patch clamp analysis in HEK293 cells; co-expressed with WT subunits\nDecreased nicotine sensitivity of I297F","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25770198","rdfs:label":"Patch clamp analysis in HEK293 Cells"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0f832b8a-af5a-494e-bfdb-70cc619addf1_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/93698622-9901-417f-98d8-473ed5bd2245","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ac1436a8-1831-4f81-807c-175a8dcbe0e6","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Western blot study with multiple organ/tissue and the expression of CHRNA2 gene showed in brain, thalamus tissue","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16826524","rdfs:label":"Gene expression study in multiple tissue","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0f832b8a-af5a-494e-bfdb-70cc619addf1_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0f832b8a-af5a-494e-bfdb-70cc619addf1_ad_other_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/86c0fcc4-caf1-41cb-8855-b264869828f6_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8341273b-4829-4658-b4a7-036b7ba66d0d","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30809122","rdfs:label":"II-1","firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"nocturnal episodes with abnormal motor-behavioral phenomena occurring several times every night.
