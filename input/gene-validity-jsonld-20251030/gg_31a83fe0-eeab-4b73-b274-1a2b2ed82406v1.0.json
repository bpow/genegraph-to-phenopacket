The GJB6-D13S1830 deletion is a relatively common disease allele in many populations and is classified as pathogenic for hearing loss, frequently identified in homozygosity or in trans with a pathogenic GJB2 variant. This is a deletion of approximately 309kb of DNA including the 5' end of GJB6 and a region upstream of both GJB6 and the GJB2 gene. It has been proposed that GJB6 and GJB2 are co-regulated by a cis-acting element (Ahmad 2007 PMID 17227867). Their protein products, connexin 30 and 26 (Cx30 and Cx26), respectively, co-localize in the supporting cells of mouse cochlea (Ahmad 2003 PMID 12859965; Forge 2003 PMID 14595769) but not human cochlea (Liu 2016 PMID 26941236). Deletion of the GJB6 gene, including surrounding regulatory regions, in mice causes hearing loss (Teubner 2003 PMID 12490528). Exogenous Cx30 and Cx26 could both rescue the hearing loss in this mouse (Ahmad 2007 PMID 17227867; Qu 2012 PMID 22142852). However, an independent mouse model with only the coding sequence of GJB6 deleted and no surrounding sequence deleted had normal hearing, suggesting that the regulatory region 5' of GJB6 but not the gene itself is necessary for normal hearing in mice. Furthermore, many deletions upstream of both GJB6 and GJB2 are pathogenic for hearing loss without disruption of GJB6 (Wilch 2010 PMID 20236118;  Abou Tayoun 2016 PMID 26444186). This gene has also been implicated in Clouston syndrome. This association has been​ assessed separately. In summary, there is convincing evidence refuting the association between GJB6 and autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss, which significantly outweighs the evidence supporting the association. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hearing Loss Working Group on 4/17/2018.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/31a83fe0-eeab-4b73-b274-1a2b2ed82406","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f281869c-25e5-44ad-94e7-c7d6374755fd","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"NoKnownDiseaseRelationship","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f281869c-25e5-44ad-94e7-c7d6374755fd_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2018-04-17T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f281869c-25e5-44ad-94e7-c7d6374755fd_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"See Evidence Summary for full Refuted explanation.","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f281869c-25e5-44ad-94e7-c7d6374755fd_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f281869c-25e5-44ad-94e7-c7d6374755fd_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f281869c-25e5-44ad-94e7-c7d6374755fd_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/90a9a445-e5c4-4864-bb3e-750786f3199e","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Not scored.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d03cbe75-bc28-4616-9dc3-29ba01d69984","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Gjb6 was deleted in mice.
