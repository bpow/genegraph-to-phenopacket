{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7065e77d-53fa-4ad3-901b-f31c040fe671v1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"*CACNA1S* was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant malignant hyperthermia in 1997 (Monnier et al., PMID:9199552) and assigned the name “Malignant Hyperthermia susceptibility 5 (OMIM:601887). This condition  is a muscle disorder in which an episode is triggered by exposure to volatile anesthetic agents or depolarizing muscle relaxants (i.e., halothane, isoflurane, sevoflurane, desflurane, enflurane) either alone or in conjunction with a depolarizing muscle relaxant, leading to muscle rigidity and a hypermetabolic response involving elevated temperature, heart rate, and respiratory rate that can be fatal if not recognized and treated promptly. \n\n*CACNA1S* has been noted to be associated with the following disease entities: Hypokalemic periodic paralysis, type 1 (OMIM:170400), Malignant hyperthermia susceptibility 5 (OMIM:601887), Thyrotoxic periodic paralysis, susceptibility to,1 (OMIM:188580). Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found differences in molecular mechanisms, inheritance patterns, and phenotypic variability. Therefore, we have maintained the existing split into multiple disease entities. In addition, there is a more recent assertion for Congenital myopathy 18 due to dihydropyridine receptor defect (OMIM: 620246) that was not considered at the time of the precuration (9/15/2022). In this curation we  examine autosomal dominant Malignant hyperthermia susceptibility 5 as a distinct disease entity.\n\nEvidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, experimental data. We have curated eight pathogenic missense variants reported in ten probands, two of which (p.R1086H,  p.T1354S) were found to segregate in families (PMID: 9199552, 11260227, 20861472,25658027,25735680,19825159). A novel homozygous mutation, p.Arg1086Ser, was identified in a 34 year old female who developed fulminant malignant hyperthermia (MH) under sevoflurane anesthesia. This is the only homozygous occurrence mentioned in the literature to date and it is unclear whether it represents a distinct molecular mechanism of disease (PMID:.20431982) \n\nThis gene-disease association is supported by in vitro functional assays, expression studies, animal models, rescue models (PMID: 27129199, 2903448, 7713519, 15201141, 6329263). In summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged.\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7065e77d-53fa-4ad3-901b-f31c040fe671","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/22fff996-ca2e-473d-8a57-d2b8ff022a92","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/22fff996-ca2e-473d-8a57-d2b8ff022a92_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10026","date":"2024-02-29T23:47:09.688Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/22fff996-ca2e-473d-8a57-d2b8ff022a92_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10026","date":"2023-04-26T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/22fff996-ca2e-473d-8a57-d2b8ff022a92_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9e2ffaa8-6dcf-42ac-8062-7742b4cc2167","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9e2ffaa8-6dcf-42ac-8062-7742b4cc2167_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"PMID 15201141: Characterized the effects of the mutation on DHPR-RyR1 coupling after reconstitution in dysgenic alpha 1S null myotubes.

Additionally, a similar increase in caffeine sensitivity of calcium release is also observed upon expression of RyR1 mutation in HEK293 or skeletal myotubes. The authors compared the calcium channel activity and junctional targeting of wild type and mutant DHPRs, as well as the sensitivity of SR calcium release to caffeine. They found that sensitivity of RyR1 is enhanced in R1086H-expressing myotubes.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15201141","rdfs:label":"R1086H enhances RyR1 sensitivity"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/22fff996-ca2e-473d-8a57-d2b8ff022a92_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/af781518-999d-48d6-b04e-29936a624714","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Ryr1 is also part of the complex, and variants in Ryr1 are known to cause MHS.","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a4f03111-bd0e-4404-bdf4-9c2b233d15eb","type":"Finding","dc:description":"MH involves a dysregulation of calcium transport caused by abnormal function of the EC coupling complex.
