Myosin Va is a processive molecular motor that is described to be responsible for the actin-dependent transport of different types of organelles. The protein encoded by this gene is abundant in melanocytes and nerve cells. Mutations in MYO5A gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Griscelli syndrome, type 1 (GS1) in 1997 (Pastural et al., PMID: 9207796). GS1 represents hypomelanosis with a primary neurologic deficit and without immunologic impairment. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included six unique variants (4 nonsense, 1 frameshift, 1 intragenic deletion) reported in six unrelated probands in five publications (PMID 9207796, Pastural et al., 2000, PMID: 10704277, Menasche et al., 2003, PMID: 12897212, Thomas et al., 2009, PMID: 19318926, Abd Elmaksoud et al. 2020, PMID 32275080). The gene-disease association is supported by myosin Va biochemical function (Wu et al., 1998), MYO5A expression in human skin cells (Lambert et al., 1998, PMID 9826529) and human cerebellum (Souza et al., 2013, PMID 23558932), functional alteration of MYO5A in human epidermal melanocytes (Van Gele et al., 2008, PMID: 18401430), and mouse models that reproduce part of the human phenotype (Provance et al. 1996, PMID 8962090, Takagishi et al. 2006, PMID 1718550). In summary, MYO5A is definitively associated with autosomal recessive Griscelli syndrome type 1. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Syndromic Disorders Gene Curation Expert Panel on the meeting date 26Jan2021 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a99284a4-6977-4810-b7c5-f9be4f5fd219","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/792cf7b2-5ca7-4d85-95a5-a43eaa52b180","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/792cf7b2-5ca7-4d85-95a5-a43eaa52b180_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10060","date":"2021-07-27T14:49:12.369Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/792cf7b2-5ca7-4d85-95a5-a43eaa52b180_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10060","date":"2021-07-27T14:49:01.941Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/792cf7b2-5ca7-4d85-95a5-a43eaa52b180_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cf00995d-e08d-453a-a158-fc46ac2c914b_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Not scored.

The mutant rats also developed movement disorders such as staggering and difficulty in walking and clonic convulsion with opisthotonus were manifested. Analysis of the myosin Va (Myo5a) gene of the dilute-opisthotonus (dop) genome showed the presence of a complex rearrangement consisting of a 306-bp inversion associated with 217-bp and 17-bp deletions.  A 141-bp exon is skipped in the dop transcript, producing a dop cDNA with a 141 in-frame deletion in the sequences encoding the head region. Expression of the MyoVA protein is severely impaired (Fig 3) in the brains of dilute-opisthotonus (dop) homozygous rats, suggesting they have a null mutation for Myo5a.\nAbsence of smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER) and inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) receptors in the dendritic spines of Purkinje cells (PC) were observed in morphological analysis of the cerebella of dop rats. The SER acts as an intracellular Ca(2+) store and IP3-mediated Ca(2+) signaling in dendritic spines plays a critical role in synaptic regulation. Synaptic transmission and long-term depression (LTD), a form of synaptic plasticity underlying cerebellar motor learning were measured, at PC synapses in the cerebella of dop rats. Synaptic transmission at the PC synapses is found to be largely normal, whereas the LTD is deficient due to a decrease in IP3-mediated Ca(2+) release from the SER in the PC spines of the dop cerebella. These findings may account for the ataxic movements and clonic convulsions displayed by dop rats.
