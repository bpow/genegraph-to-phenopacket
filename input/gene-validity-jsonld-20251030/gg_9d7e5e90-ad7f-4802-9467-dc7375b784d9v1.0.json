{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9d7e5e90-ad7f-4802-9467-dc7375b784d9v1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"The *CCNQ* gene is located on chromosome X at Xq28 and encodes the ubiquitously expressed cyclin Q, the activating cyclin for the cyclin-associated kinase CDK10. *CCNQ* was first reported in relation to X-linked Toe Syndactyly, Telecanthus, Anogenital and Renal malformations (STAR) syndrome in 2008 (Unger et al., 2008, PMID:18297069). Only female probands are reported as affected with this developmental disorder which is characterized by a broad spectrum of variable phenotypes that include dysmorphic facial features, cardiovascular and skeletal abnormalities as well as the toe syndactyly, telecanthus, anogenital and renal malformations described by the disorder’s acronym. Severity of disease is also highly variable and dependent upon the level of X-inactivation.\n\nGenetic evidence supporting the relationship between *CCNQ* and STAR syndrome includes six unique variants (one gross deletion, two splice site, two stop gain and one frameshift) which have been reported in six probands from three publications (PMID: 18297069, Boczek et al., 2016, PMID: 28322501; Che et al., 2023, PMID:36284407) and are included in this curation. Loss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease.This gene-disease relationship is also supported by biochemical pathway and protein-protein interaction studies (PMID: 18297069; Guen et al.,(2016), PMID: 27104747). In summary, there is moderate evidence supporting the relationship between *CCNQ* and X-linked STAR syndrome. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Syndromic Disorders GCEP on July 19th, 2024 (SOP Version 10).\n\nOf note, an additional six probands have been reported in the literature with deletions encompassing additional genetic material and were not included in the curation (PMID:18297069; Boone et al.,(2010) PMID: 20848651; Zarate et al.,( 2015); PMID: 25845904;  Orge et al.,(2016), PMID:26882209; Bedeschi et al.,2017, PMID: 29088509; Lefroy et al. , 2017, PMID:  28225384). One additional proband reported to have STAR syndrome was not included in this curation due to insufficient phenotype information (Gabriel et al., 2021, PMID: 34958143).\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9d7e5e90-ad7f-4802-9467-dc7375b784d9","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/23aca7cf-8896-4a9d-a40b-94b6c8f18398","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/23aca7cf-8896-4a9d-a40b-94b6c8f18398_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10060","date":"2025-01-07T15:34:29.971Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/23aca7cf-8896-4a9d-a40b-94b6c8f18398_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10060","date":"2024-07-19T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/23aca7cf-8896-4a9d-a40b-94b6c8f18398_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/42e94b9f-fe3d-4909-ac8c-72c841d7f7dc","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"1.5 LoF variant -0.5 pt escapes NMD\nTotal: 1 pt  (disruption of protein, mechanism unclear).\n","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/42e94b9f-fe3d-4909-ac8c-72c841d7f7dc_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"c.502_518delinsA (p.Val168SerfsTer153): Exon 4/5 leads to protein tail extension. \n\nPoor functional data not considered in final score: Mutant protein has increased the binding affinity in the CDK10-cyclin M complex (IP over-expression studies in HEK293 cells and in silico docking analysis).\n\nZebrafish overexpressing either WT or mutant protein:\nThe abnormality rate of early embryo development in zygotes overexpressed wild-type CCNQ was significantly higher than that of mutant CCNQ.
