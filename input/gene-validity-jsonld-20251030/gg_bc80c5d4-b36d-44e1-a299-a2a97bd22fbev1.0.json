Prior to this in 2000, (Topçu et al., PMID: 10677334) the location of the gene was mapped to Chromosome 22qtel. \n\nPrior to the identification of the gene, the condition was first clinically described in 1995 (Van der Knaap et al., PMID: 7695231).  A group of 8 children were described with infantile onset megaloencepahly and cerebral leukodystrophy with slowly progressive ataxia and spasticity. Brain MRI were significant for diffuse abnormality in signal intensity and swelling of the cerebral hemispheral white matter with cyst-like spaces in the frontoparietal and anterior-temporal subcortical areas.\n\nPer criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in molecular mechanisms or inheritance pattern. Therefore, there is one disease entity, Megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts 1 (OMIM:604004). \n\n11 variants (missense, nonsense, frameshift,) that have been reported in 9 probands in 5 publications (PMIDs: 25497041, 32056211, 12189496, 21145992, 27389245) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached.\n\nThe mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss of function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence (functional alteration, expression studies) (PMIDs: 18757878). Lower expression in rat astrocytes and altered pH distribution.\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *MLC1 *and autosomal recessive megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts 1. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time.\n\nThis classification was approved by the ClinGen Leukodystrophy and Leukoencephalopathy GCEP at the meeting November 25, 2024 (SOP Version 11).\n\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bc80c5d4-b36d-44e1-a299-a2a97bd22fbe","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bf223498-7297-4fe5-8476-95cb8ff3145d","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bf223498-7297-4fe5-8476-95cb8ff3145d_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10107","date":"2024-11-25T18:55:48.086Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bf223498-7297-4fe5-8476-95cb8ff3145d_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10107","date":"2024-11-25T08:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bf223498-7297-4fe5-8476-95cb8ff3145d_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4a3ee11c-27e0-4a03-83db-1f294190e00c_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b29748c0-0ea4-4818-b67e-5a96bb44175d","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Per ClinGen NDWG scoring guidelines, proband scores are capped at 2.","calculatedScore":3.0,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b29748c0-0ea4-4818-b67e-5a96bb44175d_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32056211","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a4fb52a0-4a58-4c4d-bf52-e05ecb598816","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_015166.4(MLC1):c.423+1G>A","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA10303565"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4a3ee11c-27e0-4a03-83db-1f294190e00c","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32056211","rdfs:label":"FROUKH 2020 TF060_1","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":8,"allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a4fb52a0-4a58-4c4d-bf52-e05ecb598816"},"detectionMethod":"WES was conducted on genomic DNA of at least one affected proband per family.
