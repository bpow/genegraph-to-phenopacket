At least six unique variants (one frameshift, and four missenses, 1 start loss)  have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least five probands in five publications (PMIDs:  11196645;  24612435; 25428217; 12578987; 16194207). Strikingly, at least one proband and the family members showed to carry a concomitant mutation in another receptor (PMID: 24612435), which suggested that the variability in the phenotypes may be due to unexplored concomitant common or rare variants in other platelet or hemostatic genes. This gene-disease relationship is supported by its biochemical function that P2Y12 receptor stimulation induced rapid activation of Rap1 (PMID: 16236484), expression A evidence that P2Y12 receptor is selectively expressed in platelets (PMID: 11196645), expression B evidence that reduced P2Y12 receptor expression in patients (PMID: 24612435 ), functional alteration in both patient (PMID: 12578987, 16194207) and non-patient cells (PMID: 24612435).In summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged.\n\nThis gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the Hemostasis Thrombosis GCEP on 08/26/2020. It was reevaluated on 04/02/2023. As a result of this reevaluation, the classification did not change.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/aae9a1c7-cb24-49ab-8178-fd03d33cf30b","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6b61af44-1fb4-4c7d-94b2-f21903793162","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","changes":[{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"},{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},{"id":"cg:sopChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6b61af44-1fb4-4c7d-94b2-f21903793162_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2023-04-03T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6b61af44-1fb4-4c7d-94b2-f21903793162_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2023-04-07T00:16:09.727Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6b61af44-1fb4-4c7d-94b2-f21903793162_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/addde2aa-ea1c-4dc4-950a-9531988e5c3a_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/addde2aa-ea1c-4dc4-950a-9531988e5c3a","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16194207","rdfs:label":"OSP-1","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":67,"allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fca00984-c891-4072-a38b-a7ba1de18aa6","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NC_000003.12:g.151338844A>C (GRCh38)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA354984535"}},"detectionMethod":"cDNA obtained by RT-PCR from platelet mRNA was analyzed by sequencing using a sense primer Y12F1.
