This individual had a homozygous missense variant, Asp141Tyr, which has since been found to occur at a frequency of 0.3% (based on the total gnomADv2.1.1 non-neuro population) and is not considered plausibly causative of ALS for this curation. Since 2004 rare heterozygous variants have been identified in additional ALS patients and an autosomal dominant mechanism has been considered here. *PRPH* encodes peripherin, a neuronal-specific intermediate filament protein expressed predominantly in the peripheral nervous system. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. At least 4 plausibly causative, rare variants have been reported in relation to ALS (including frameshift and missense variants). Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 4 probands in 3 publications (PMIDs: 15322088, 25299611, 26742954). Experimentally, this gene-disease relationship is supported by its expression in the nerous system (PMID: 3339087) and the fact that it is a major component found in inclusions of patients with ALS (PMID: 14675609). Additionally, an mouse model with overexpression of *PRPH* (PMID: 15132161) showed massive and selective degeneration of motor axons during aging. In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged.\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5b8699ca-bdd2-401e-941d-a06f45e35bd0","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3d11b04d-508a-4f91-9d9a-b5016fd0b940","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3d11b04d-508a-4f91-9d9a-b5016fd0b940_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10096","date":"2022-12-13T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3d11b04d-508a-4f91-9d9a-b5016fd0b940_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10096","date":"2022-12-13T20:19:46.593Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3d11b04d-508a-4f91-9d9a-b5016fd0b940_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1b0ba99e-1c18-4271-8a2d-f9bbdf9352c3","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The authors conclude that there is no evidence based on in vitro transfection assays that this variant had any effects on peripherin processing and assembly into the IF network and therefore, this sequence variation is probably a rare polymorphism.","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1b0ba99e-1c18-4271-8a2d-f9bbdf9352c3_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"This variant is not predicted by SpliceAI or VARseak to affect splicing.\n\nIn vitro expression studies showed that the IVS8-36insA mutation resulted in WT-like self-assembly of proteins into the typical intermediate filament network.
