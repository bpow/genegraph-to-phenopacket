EPCAM is also involved in multiple cellular events including cell migration, proliferation, and differentiation. Deletions of *EPCAM* that silence nearby *MSH2* has been linked to autosomal dominant Lynch Syndrome, which was curated separately. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, curations to refute or dispute can be split when needed. This curation focuses on refuting the association with breast cancer. Evidence curated in this gene-disease relationship includes case-control data and experimental data.\n\n**Summary of Case-Control Data: 0 point** \nThis gene-disease relationship has been studied in at least 1 large case-control studies at the aggregate level in 2021 [BCAC (PMID: 33471991) with more than 48 thousand cases and controls] did not identify a significant association of aggregate loss of function (LOF) variants in *EPCAM* and breast cancer. \n \n**Summary of Experimental Data: 0 point**\nThere is experimental evidence showing that knockdown of *EPCAM* in breast cell lines has variable effects on cell proliferation, in which some cell lines showed low growth and others showed high growth. Another study reported that EPCAM is expressed in  human breast epithelium and human ovarian epithelium. However, since the experimental evidence is not specific and conclusive, no point was awarded. \n \n**Overall Summary:**\nIn summary, given the lack of significant association in large breast cancer case-control studies to date, there is convincing evidence refuting the association between *EPCAM* and autosomal dominant hereditary breast cancer, which significantly outweighs the evidence supporting the association. This gene-disease pair was originally evaluated as no known disease relationship by the Breast/Ovarian Cancer GCEP on 4/12/2017. This re-curation was approved by the ClinGen Hereditary Diseases GCEP on 6/9/2023 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/37db891a-59a0-4420-9b69-02c3984375bf","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/efe1b152-d818-49bd-9f6f-cebe944b3404","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"NoKnownDiseaseRelationship","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/efe1b152-d818-49bd-9f6f-cebe944b3404_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10023","date":"2023-12-21T17:12:54.592Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/efe1b152-d818-49bd-9f6f-cebe944b3404_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10023","date":"2023-12-21T18:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"Given the lack of significant association in large breast cancer case-control studies to date, there is convincing evidence refuting the association between EPCAM and autosomal dominant hereditary breast cancer, which significantly outweighs the evidence supporting the association.","curationReasons":["RecurationFrameworkChange","RecurationNewEvidence"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/efe1b152-d818-49bd-9f6f-cebe944b3404_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/efe1b152-d818-49bd-9f6f-cebe944b3404_cc_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c404304f-a4b2-4e6b-af18-126ee43b627c","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"    \"Case and controls were also matched for sex (only females) and for race or ethnic group, other than age.
