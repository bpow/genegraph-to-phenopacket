Loeys Dietz syndrome is a multisystemic disorder with craniofacial, skeletal, integumental and ocular involvement (reviewed in Van Laer et al., 2014 PMID: 24443023 ). Loeys Dietz syndrome comprises a broad phenotypic spectrum of severity including seemingly isolated aortic aneurysm and/or dissection to the full syndrome  and thus represents a continuum of disease (reviewed in Van Laer et al., 2014 PMID: 24443023; Verstraeten et al., 2016 PMID: 26919284). Aortic aneurysm and tortuosity represent the  major morbidity and mortality of Loeys Dietz syndrome. Over 120 variants have been identified in TGBFR1 (Verstraeten et al., 2016 PMID: 26919284) according to the UMD-TGFBR1 database (http://www.umd.be/TGFBR1/), with the majority being missense and more rarely, nonsense, splice site and small deletions. The mechanism for the gene-disease relationship is perturbation of the TGF beta signaling pathway, however the exact molecular mechanism remains unclear and could include gain of function and dominant negative (reviewed in Van Laer et al., 2014 PMID: 24443023; Verstraeten et al., 2016 PMID: 26919284). The majority of the mutations result in aberrant kinase activity of TGFBR1. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, functional data, and model organisms. This gene-disease relationship has been studied for more than 10 years and a significant amount of case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data is available and the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. Note, this curation effort may not be exhaustive of all literature related to this gene-disease relationship. \n\nIn summary, TGFBR1 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant Loeys Dietz syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen General GCEP on March 27, 2019 (SOP Version 6).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/33d96aaf-bac6-42e6-8bdb-c444c3b498eb","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8a546ce2-432c-4c8a-90e5-97293d7938be","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8a546ce2-432c-4c8a-90e5-97293d7938be_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10026","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8a546ce2-432c-4c8a-90e5-97293d7938be_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10026","date":"2019-03-27T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8a546ce2-432c-4c8a-90e5-97293d7938be_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8a546ce2-432c-4c8a-90e5-97293d7938be_ad_dn_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6610edf9-fa68-4fb7-8a7e-9723ad2673de_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The mouse model of Loeys-Dietz syndrome in which the M318R variant is expressed (PMID: 24355923) fully recapitulates the human phenotypes and disease, supporting the pathogenicity of this variant.
