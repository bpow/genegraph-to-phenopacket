This association was made using case-level and case-control data. Factor V Leiden is a missense variant that causes the amino acid change Arg534Gln, which results in the loss of the APC cleavage site and, therefore, APC resistance. Individuals carrying this variant are at an increased risk of developing thrombosis and thromboembolism. Other missense variants with similar impact on APC resistance are also reported. F5 was first associated with this disease in humans as early as 1994 (Bertina et al., PMID: 8164741).\n\nSummary of Case Level Data (3.7 points): The association is seen in at least 16 probands in 6 publications (PMIDs: 28889200, 8164741, 7734374, 14617013, 27090446, 9454742). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 6 additional family members. The Factor V Leiden variant has been reported in multiple publications from across the world. \n\nSummary of Case-Control Data (6.5 points): Association is seen in at least 3 case-control studies (PMID: 29179580, 11583312, 10666427, 26649017) at the single variant level. More case-control evidence is available in the literature. \n\nThe mechanism for disease is gain of function, with the FVL variant and other missense variants observed causing resistance to inactivation by APC and therefore causing an increased risk of thrombosis. (PMID: 8164741).\n\nSummary of Experimental Data (4 points): This gene-disease relationship is supported by functional evidence and mouse models that recapitulate human disease (PMID: 16268462, 11110695, 9616155, 3286010). \n\nIn summary, the F5- Thrombophilia due to activated protein C resistance gene-disease relationship is Definitive. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hemostasis/Thrombosis GCEP on September 30, 2019 (SOP Version 6).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4a86d096-a03b-428b-9f23-95b60ad108f8","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ab28e09c-08ff-4149-a536-3cdb9cc4099f","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ab28e09c-08ff-4149-a536-3cdb9cc4099f_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ab28e09c-08ff-4149-a536-3cdb9cc4099f_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2019-09-30T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ab28e09c-08ff-4149-a536-3cdb9cc4099f_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ab28e09c-08ff-4149-a536-3cdb9cc4099f_ad_other_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e16ce1ff-631c-42cf-93b9-e1359aaf7a29_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The proband was homozygous for the missense variant, Trp1948Arg, which was found to be associated with APC resistance.
