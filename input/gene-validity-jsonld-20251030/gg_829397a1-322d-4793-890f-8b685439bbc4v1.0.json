The split curation for autosomal dominant nonsyndromic hearing loss is curated separately. The mechanism of pathogenicity is reported to be loss of function (PMID: 29703829). Four variants (missense, splicing, nonsense) that have been reported in four homozygous probands in three publications (PMIDs: 29703829, 30514912, 33111345) are included in this curation. Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 8 additional family members. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by two mouse models, expression data, and protein interaction data (PMIDs: 31249509, 25080593, 21368133, 22544735). In summary, there is strong evidence to support the relationship between CEACAM16 and autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss. Additional reports in humans are needed​ to reach a definitive classification. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hearing Loss GCEP on the meeting date 12.21.2022 (SOP Version 9).\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/829397a1-322d-4793-890f-8b685439bbc4","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bcc9ab02-1df0-485a-a806-2651171120cd","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Strong","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bcc9ab02-1df0-485a-a806-2651171120cd_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2022-12-21T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bcc9ab02-1df0-485a-a806-2651171120cd_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2023-01-24T18:35:54.426Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bcc9ab02-1df0-485a-a806-2651171120cd_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bcc9ab02-1df0-485a-a806-2651171120cd_seg_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/84e39557-31ff-4e55-9feb-e66887fd8ade_proband_segregation","type":"FamilyCosegregation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30514912","rdfs:label":"Dias_Family","estimatedLodScore":1.7,"family":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/84e39557-31ff-4e55-9feb-e66887fd8ade","type":"Family","rdfs:label":"Dias_Family","ethnicity":{"id":"cg:UnknownEthnicity"},"member":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e1ead4aa-b058-4b3c-9f84-9dcaafee6e1d","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30514912","rdfs:label":"V:1","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8d3aa5da-dacb-4f61-aa97-06a596bd6897","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001039213.4(CEACAM16):c.436C>T (p.Arg146Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA406288143"}},"detectionMethod":"A NGS panel of 100 genes related to hearing loss was used to test the family.","ethnicity":{"id":"cg:UnknownEthnicity"},"firstTestingMethod":"Next generation sequencing panels","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0000486","obo:HP_0000639","obo:HP_0001107","obo:HP_0000408"],"previousTesting":false,"sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f6824922-bfb6-4dbd-9a1c-796594344b2a_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30514912","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8d3aa5da-dacb-4f61-aa97-06a596bd6897"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"}}}},"meetsInclusionCriteria":true,"phenotypeNegativeAlleleNegative":4,"phenotypePositiveAllelePositive":3,"phenotypes":["obo:HP_0000408","obo:HP_0000639","obo:HP_0000486","obo:HP_0000407","obo:HP_0001107","obo:HP_0005101"],"proband":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e1ead4aa-b058-4b3c-9f84-9dcaafee6e1d"},"sequencingMethod":{"id":"cg:AllGenesSequencing"}},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8034cd5e-6f80-44c1-9578-a7e0393cd293_proband_segregation","type":"FamilyCosegregation","dc:description":"The GCEP decided not to score the case because it is both frequent in gnomAD and the missense variant is not consistent with the proposed mechanism of disease.
