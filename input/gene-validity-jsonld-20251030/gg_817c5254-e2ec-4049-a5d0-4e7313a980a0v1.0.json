The authors found an individual with ID and a balanced translocation disrupting *KIRREL3* and *CDH15* and went on to identify five additional individuals with ID and *KIRREL3* missense variants of unknown inheritance. However, two of the three unique variants had an allele frequency in gnomAD too high to be considered pathogenic. Since then, additional individuals with *KIRREL3* missense variants and neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD), including ID, autism, and seizures, have been reported in the literature; at least 5 were *de novo* (PMIDs: 25363760, 25363768, 28714951, 32503885, 33853164), but 8 were inherited from an unaffected parent (PMIDs: 27824329, 29271092). None of the missense variants were scored due to their presence in gnomAD and/or inheritance from reportedly unaffected parents and a lack of evidence of pathogenicity. Additionally, 3 probands with truncating variants have been reported: one with a de novo variant and ID (PMID: 26411299) and 2 with an inherited variant and ASD (PMID: 37007974). KIRREL3 is not constrained for truncating variants (pLI = 0, gnomAD v4.0.0) or missense variants (Z = 1.59). Therefore, the truncating variants were also not scored.\n\nKIRREL3 is a synaptic cell adhesion protein shown to be required for synapse formation in the rodent hippocampus (PMIDs: 26575286, 28670619). Functional in vitro studies of five *KIRREL3* missense variants observed in affected individuals showed decreased synapse formation in hippocampal neurons (PMID: 32503885); however, at least two of these variants were observed at a high frequency in gnomAD, questioning the relevance of this assay for the neurodevelopmental phenotypes observed in humans.  \n\nWhile studies in homozygous null Kirrel3-/- mice and synapse deficits in cultured Kirrel3+/- mouse hippocampal neurons suggest that *KIRREL3* plays a role in central nervous system development, none of the experimental evidence was scored due to the lack of compelling genetic evidence.\n\nIn summary, the evidence supporting the relationship between *KIRREL3* and complex neurodevelopmental disorder has been disputed and no valid evidence remains to support the claim. More evidence is needed to either support or entirely refute the role of *KIRREL3* in this disorder. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel on November 8, 2023 (SOP Version 10).\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/817c5254-e2ec-4049-a5d0-4e7313a980a0","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/55fd22eb-792f-4e84-926d-846aae0f4733","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"NoKnownDiseaseRelationship","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/55fd22eb-792f-4e84-926d-846aae0f4733_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2023-11-08T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/55fd22eb-792f-4e84-926d-846aae0f4733_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2024-03-13T21:14:11.935Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"To date, over 20 probands (PMIDs: 29271092, 32503885, 37007974) with KIRREL3 truncating or missense variants and complex neurodevelopmental disorder have been reported.
