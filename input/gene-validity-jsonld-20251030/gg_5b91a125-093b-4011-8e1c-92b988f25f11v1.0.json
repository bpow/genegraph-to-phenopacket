Affected individuals with causal variants in *REEP6* have since been identified in 3 other publications (PMID: 29120066, 31538292 and 33917198), with cases showing onset at ages ranging from early childhood to 39 years. Presenting phenotypes include a combination of nyctalopia, bony spicules, constricted visual fields, reduced visual acuity, attenuated retinal vessels, severe generalized retinal dystrophy with severely reduced or undetectable electroretinogram (ERG) responses and outer retinal atrophy.  Additional features can include cystoid macular edema, posterior subcapsular cataracts and dyschromatopsia. These cases with causal variants in *REEP6* are typically diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa 77 (MONDO:0015013, MIM #: 617304), but have been curated under the broader disease term REEP6-related retinopathy in order to be inclusive of the full diversity of patient phenotypes.\n\nThis curation has scored ten suspected deleterious variants in *REEP6* (four missense, four frameshift, one nonsense and one canonical splice site), which have been collectively reported in nine probands in four publications (PMIDs: 27889058, 29120066, 31538292 and 33917198). Most of the probands were members of consanguineous families and were homozygous for the variant of interest. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss of function in REEP6, characterized in at least some cases by variants predicted to trigger the absence of the gene product. More genetic evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence has been reached (PMID: 36819107).\n\nThis gene-disease association is also supported by expression evidence that the long isoform (*REEP6.1*) of *REEP6* is highly expressed in the retina, specifically in rod photoreceptors (PMIDs: 34104971 and 24691551). Biochemical studies further support a structural function of REEP6 in the retina as evidenced by strong binding of NRL (associated with retinal degeneration and retinitis pigmentosa 27) in the intronic region of *REEP6*, which increases its promoter activity in an *in vitro* reporter assay (PMID: 24691551). Furthermore, REEP6 is present in a subset of clathrin-coated vesicles (STX3) and colocalizes in rod spherules. This study suggests a critical function of REEP6 in trafficking of cargo via a subset of clathrin-coated vesicles to selected membrane sites in rod photoreceptor cells (28369466). Knockdown of *Reep6* in mouse retina using shRNA might lead to the death of transfected photoreceptor cells as shown by thinner outer nuclear layer in the electroporated area. Knockdown of reep6 by translation blocking morpholino in zebrafish leads to severely compromised eye development in the morphants. Taken together, these results show that *REEP6* is required for retinal development in zebrafish and mouse (24691551). *Reep6L135P/-* compound heterozygous mice mimic the patient genotype and recapitulate the early-onset retinal degeneration phenotypes observed in the individual with retinitis pigmentosa. rAAV-mediated *REEP6* transduction in photoreceptor cells successfully rescued the phenotypes including thin outer nuclear layer and rod ERG responses (PMIDs: 30101608 and 34104971). \n\nIn summary, *REEP6* is definitively associated with REEP6-related retinopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both research and diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time without the emergence of contradictory evidence, leading to a definitive classification. This classification has been approved by the ClinGen Retina GCEP on July 11th, 2024 (SOP Version 10).

Some regions of the tissue exhibited weaker immunoreactivity due to the inconsistent nature of subretinal injections. Consistent with the expression pattern of REEP6, the areas that were targeted exhibited preservation of overall retinal morphology compared with areas that remained untreated, where marked thinning of the retina was observed on gross examination. On the basis of the data, it is evident that the rAAV8-Reep6.1 vector results in stable and efficient expression of REEP6 in rod photoreceptors of Reep6L135P/− mice after treatment by subretinal injections.\nPreservation of photoreceptor integrity and function in rAAV8-Reep6.1-treated Reep6 mutant mice\n\nH&E staining of the untreated LE in 11-week-old mice shows reduction in overall retinal thickness and marked thinning of the ONL (Fig. 4A and B), in comparison with treated Reep6L135P/− REs and Reep6 wild-type control mice (Fig. 4C and D). On treatment with rAAV8-Reep6.1, Reep6L135P/− mouse REs showed drastic improvements in overall retinal morphology as evident by preservation of photoreceptor cell nuclei in the ONL and increased ONL thickness (Fig. 4C and D) in regions where REEP6 is robustly expressed (Fig. 3B and D). Consequently, in areas of the retina distant from the site of injection and that lack REEP6 expression, the retinal morphology was less intact in the RE, but improved nonetheless compared with the untreated LE. Quantitative morphometric analysis of Reep6 wild-type, Reep6L135P/− LE, and Reep6L135P/− RE shows the ONL thickness averaged from six retinas per group; evidently, there is an improvement in the morphology of the photoreceptors in the treated group.\nIn comparison, the treated RE of Reep6L135P/− mutant mice had improvements in the dark-adapted scotopic response at various flash intensities. There was a statistically significant improvement in the a-wave response (indicated by a hashtag symbol); the b-wave (combined rod photoreceptor and inner retinal neurons response) response was also improved, although not significantly. Furthermore, there was no significant difference between the treated RE and the wild-type scotopic b-wave responses (Fig. 5A and B, blue line), demonstrating functional retention of rod photoreceptors resulting from expression of the Reep6.1 transgene.\nLong-term rescue efficiency of rAAV8-Reep6.1-mediated gene therapy in Reep6 mutant mice\n On the basis of the comparative ERG analysis, it is evident that rod photoreceptor response is significantly preserved in Reep6 mutant mice, even up to 1 year posttreatment.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30101608","rdfs:label":" rAAV8-Reep6.1-treated Reep6 mutant mice","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:PhenotypeRescue"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanRescueCriteria","strengthScore":2.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b46e1df4-e37a-4b59-af69-d388c6dbc6a1_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2269759d-0ba6-4d1c-a929-c7078aa91e8e","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2fb9f9bb-2070-42b7-b046-a9b2b3522422","type":"Finding","dc:description":"High NRL binding was evident in the intronic region of Reep6 (Fig. 3B), concordant with previous ChIP-Seq results and higher expression of Reep6.1 transcript in mature rod photoreceptors (see Fig. 1C). o test whether NRL binding enhances Reep6 promoter activity, we cloned the NRL-binding intronic region at the 3′-end of a luciferase reporter gene that is driven by the Reep6 basal promoter (752 bp).

We then performed immuno-electron microscopy (EM) of vesicles isolated from bovine retina extracts using anti-REEP6 antibody. REEP6 gold particles were detected on a subset of vesicles that exhibited triskelion structure characteristic of Clathrin-coated vesicles (Fig. 4D). To investigate co-localization of REEP6 and Clathrin, we did high resolution immunofluorescence microscopy using adult mouse retina sections. As reported previously (30,31), REEP6 labeling was evident throughout the rod photoreceptor with intense labeling in the outer plexiform layer (OPL) associated with spherules (rod-specific pre-synaptic morphology) (Fig. 4E, upper panel). Clathrin is ubiquitously expressed in rods but is also present at high levels in plexiform layers of the retina (Fig. 4E, middle panel showing OPL). At higher magnification, we detected co-localization of REEP6 (green) and Clathrin (red) to vesicles in rod spherules (Fig. 4F). The dark profile within each circular rod spherule represents a mitochondrion located near the ribbon synapse. REEP6 containing vesicles are also visible in the rod cytoplasm in the outer nuclear layer. A region of interest (ROI) comprised of rod spherules was analyzed to assess the extent of REEP6 and Clathrin co-localization. This region yielded a Pearson’s correlation coefficient of 0.541 when calculated with Volocity co-localization software and utilizing auto-thresholding features.
