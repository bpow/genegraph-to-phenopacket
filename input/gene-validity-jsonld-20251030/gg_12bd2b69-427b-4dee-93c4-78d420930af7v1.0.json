PMID 21868677). Though MED23 was initially associated with non-syndromic intellectual disability, as the number of probands reported in the literature has increased, a consistent phenotypic profile has been appreciated among reported probands, including early onset epilepsy, spasticity, microcephaly and, less frequently, delayed myelination and thin corpus callosum. For this reason, syndromic intellectual disability was selected as the disease entity for MED23 curation. The gene disease relationship is supported by case-level, segregation and experimental data. Variants in MED23 have been reported in 11 affected individuals from 6 unrelated families, 4 with homozygous missense variants and 2 with compound heterozygous variants in trans (a total of 1 nonsense and 7 missense variants) in 6 publications (PMIDs 21868677, 25845469, 27311965, 27457812, 30847200, 31164858). Variants in this gene segregate with disease in at least one family (PMID 21868677). It has been shown that loss of function variants in MED23 and other mediator complex subunits are linked to neurological disorders specifically through transcriptional dysregulation of target genes (PMID 21868677). Missense variants that are shown to result in protein loss of function through dysregulation of specific target genes expression in an assay using patient cells were scored equal to the number of points awarded to putative null variants. The gene-disease relationship is supported by a number of functional studies including non-human model organism (PMID 19417216), biochemical (PMID 11934987), and rescue experiments (PMID 21868677). In summary, the available evidence of gene-disease relationship is convincing due to phenotypic similarities observed in 4 of the families and in particular mutations in other genes encoding subunits of the Mediator kinase module (MED12, MED13, MED13L and CDK8: PMIDs 6711603, 17369503, 29740699, 24781760, 30905399) have been shown to be involved in ID/ASD, however, additional genetic and/or experimental data is needed to reach a score sufficient for classification of “Definitive”. Currently, there is moderate evidence to support the relationship between MED23 with autosomal recessive syndromic intellectual disability. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel on 4/1/20 (SOP Version 7).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/12bd2b69-427b-4dee-93c4-78d420930af7","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6e8c75f0-39ae-4967-b95d-a92c55739876","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6e8c75f0-39ae-4967-b95d-a92c55739876_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2020-04-01T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6e8c75f0-39ae-4967-b95d-a92c55739876_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2020-09-16T19:23:02.770Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6e8c75f0-39ae-4967-b95d-a92c55739876_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6e8c75f0-39ae-4967-b95d-a92c55739876_seg_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/aad1131e-63e9-42d0-92c9-8166cfb32407_proband_segregation","type":"FamilyCosegregation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21868677","rdfs:label":"Hashimoto_2011 family","family":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/aad1131e-63e9-42d0-92c9-8166cfb32407","type":"Family","rdfs:label":"Hashimoto_2011 family","ethnicity":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/"},"member":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/54bc3235-0078-4e8a-a892-18c4d3f71285","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21868677","rdfs:label":"Hashimoto_2011 proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":39,"detectionMethod":"","firstTestingMethod":"Homozygosity mapping","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0002342","obo:HP_0001256"],"previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"fragile X syndrome.
