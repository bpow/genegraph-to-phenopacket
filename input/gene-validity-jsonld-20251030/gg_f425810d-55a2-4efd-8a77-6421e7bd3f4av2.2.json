Autosomal recessive limb-girdle muscular dystrophy is typically characterized by childhood-onset of proximal muscle weakness resulting in gait abnormalities and scapular winging. Many patients have elevated serum creatine kinase. A subset of patients displayed hyperkinetic movement disorder with chorea, ataxia, or dystonia and global developmental delay. Additional phenotypes such as alacrima, achalasia, cataracts, or hepatic steatosis have been observed in the literature.\n \n*TRAPC11* has been noted to be associated with autosomal recessive limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, although many authors have noted a phenotypic expansion in the literature, where the term *TRAPPC11*-related myopathy has been coined. ORPHANET lists intellectual disability-hyperkinetic movement-truncal ataxia syndrome (ORPHA:369847) and Triple A syndrome (ORPHA:869) as additional gene-disease assertions. For the purposes of this curation, cases have been scored under the autosomal recessive limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMDR18 included) disease entity, which falls under the umbrella term of *TRAPPC11*-related myopathies in MONDO. \n \nEvidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data.\n \nSummary of Case Level Data: 12 POINTS. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 14 probands in 9 publications (PMIDs: 23830518, 26322222, 27707803, 28827486, 31575891, 30105108, 29855340, 27862579, 34648194). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 7 additional family members in 2 families (PMID:23830518). Not all probands were scored due to the absence of in trans confirmation of compound heterozygous variants, however, the maximum score for genetic evidence of 12 points has been reached.  The majority of pathogenic variants in *TRAPPC11* reported in ClinVar are nonsense or frameshift variants where loss of function is the mechanism of disease.\n \nSummary of Experimental Data: 2.5 POINTS. This gene-disease association is also supported by animal model and functional alteration in human cell line (PMID: 26912795, 21525244). Loss-of-function mutations in the zebrafish ortholog of C11 have been found in the foie gras mutant, characterized by steatohepatitis and eye development defects (PMID:26912795). Mutant *TRAPPC11* zebrafish exhibits a phenotype similar to that observed in humans with respect to Golgi complex formation and endoplasmic reticulum organization supporting the role of *TRAPPC11* in the characteristic muscle phenotypes. Research conducted using HeLa cell lines revealed the role of *TRAPPC11* subunit it protein glycosylation. In HeLa cells siRNA knockdown of C11 leads to impaired binding of other TRAPP components, functional impairment of the complex, retention of secretory proteins in the ERGIC, and fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus (PMID:21525244).\n \nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy GCEP on the meeting date of December 14th, 2021 (SOP Version 8).\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f425810d-55a2-4efd-8a77-6421e7bd3f4a","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8b835ba1-afbd-48ac-afec-b9396acc5521","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":{"id":"cg:expertPanelChange"},"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8b835ba1-afbd-48ac-afec-b9396acc5521_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10151","date":"2024-08-14T19:29:50.753Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8b835ba1-afbd-48ac-afec-b9396acc5521_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10151","date":"2024-08-14T19:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["ErrorClarification"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8b835ba1-afbd-48ac-afec-b9396acc5521_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8b835ba1-afbd-48ac-afec-b9396acc5521_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/54103cf2-25bc-4fbc-835d-c6f7117764b3","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9c0452ff-5786-4e1f-87d8-d9b25c0e77ac","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"48 h after TRAPPC11 siRNA transfection, TRAPα displayed two additional moieties with increased electrophoretic mobility compared with cells transfected with a nontargeting control siRNA.
