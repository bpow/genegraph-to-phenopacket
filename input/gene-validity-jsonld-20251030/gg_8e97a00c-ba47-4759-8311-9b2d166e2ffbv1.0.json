Mutations in the gene encoding RD3 resulting in unstable non-functional C-terminal truncated proteins are responsible for early onset photoreceptor degeneration in Leber congenital amaurosis 12 (MIM#610612). Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) is the earliest and most severe form of all inherited retinal dystrophies (IRD) and the most frequent cause of inherited blindness in children.\nLeber congenital amaurosis-12 (LCA12) is an autosomal recessive form of Inherited retinal disease (IRD) and is characterized by congenital nystagmus, low vision, sluggish pupillary reflexes, absence of ocular pursuit from birth (Perrault et al., 2013)\n*RD3* is located at 1q32.3 and consists of 3 exons encoding a basic protein of 195 amino acids that is preferentially expressed in the retina (Aravindan S et al. 2017). It exhibits increasing expression throughout mouse early postnatal development. It is highly expressed in cone and rod outer segments, and colocalizes with GC1 and GC2. In cones, RD3 protein binds the C-terminus of GC1 and mediates its export from the endoplasmic reticulum to endosomal vesicles. GC1 and GC2 loss iis observed n photoreceptor cells of *rd3* mice expressing a truncated unstable rd3 protein. RD3 protein promotes accumulation of retinal membrane guanylyl cyclase (RetGC) in the photoreceptor outer segment and suppresses RetGC activation by guanylyl cyclase–activating proteins (GCAPs). Truncating variants in RD3 cause severe retinal disease by preventing the inhibitory interaction of RD3 with the guanylyl cyclase (Chang B et al. 1993; Friedman JS et al., 2006; Zulliger R. et al., 2016; Peshenko IV et al. 2019). RD3 also negatively regulaes RetGC by binding it and blocking activation by GCAPs. This ability of RD3 to bind and suppress RetGC is likely critical for photoreceptor survival (Peshenko IV et al. 2019).\n\nA total of 9 variants have already been identified underlying Leber congenital amaurosis 12. The mutation spectrum in *RD3* includes 4 nonsense, 3 frameshifts and 2 splice junction losses (PMID: 17186464, 22531706, 23308101).\n\nIn this curation, data from 3 consanguineous families and 2 isolated individuals with 5 unique variants), were collected from 3 publications (Friedman JS, et al., 2006, PMID: 17186464, Preising MN, et al., 2012, PMID: 22531706, Perrault I, et al., 2013, PMID: 23308101).\n\nExperimental evidence for expression, biochemical function and animal model systems were calculated as well (Aravindan S, et al., 2017, PMID: 29030614, Peshenko IV, et al., 2019, PMID: 30559291, Friedman JS, et al., 2006, PMID: 17186464).\n\nIn summary, *RD3* is definitively associated with RD3-related retinopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This clinical validity classification was approved by the ClinGen Retina Gene Curation Expert Panel on January 4th, 2022 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8e97a00c-ba47-4759-8311-9b2d166e2ffb","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/67c894eb-2c16-4598-8e92-8345e562d91c","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/67c894eb-2c16-4598-8e92-8345e562d91c_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10072","date":"2024-06-29T04:06:24.840Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/67c894eb-2c16-4598-8e92-8345e562d91c_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10072","date":"2022-01-06T05:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["DiseaseNameUpdate"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/67c894eb-2c16-4598-8e92-8345e562d91c_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/67c894eb-2c16-4598-8e92-8345e562d91c_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/058a1112-4811-4317-9e95-d9c23a202737","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d73037c5-c365-4f12-a680-206109c3fe6f","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Using the positional candidate approach, we have identified a CrT substitution in a novel gene, Rd3, that encodes an evolutionarily conserved protein of 195 amino acids. The rd3 mutation results in a predicted stop codon after residue 106. This change is observed in four rd3 lines derived from the original collected mice but not in the nine wild-type mouse strains that were examined. The mu- tation identified in the rd3 mouse generates a stop codon in the Rd3 gene, thereby producing a truncated protein (of 11 kDa) that appears to be less stable, at least in trans- fected COS-1 cells. Hence, the data strongly implicate partial or complete loss of RD3 protein function as a possible mechanism of retinal degeneration in the rd3 mousethe detection of a truncated RD3 mutant protein in COS-1 cells further validates the causal relationship of this mutation to retinopathy.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17186464","rdfs:label":"RD3 mouse","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/67c894eb-2c16-4598-8e92-8345e562d91c_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e275f0f0-bdab-44c5-a5e4-86cc8afd9eb9","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d6903ac9-af52-453c-b5db-a62a2c4d9a4b","type":"Finding","dc:description":"RD3 is essential for vertebrate photoreceptor function and the survival of rods and cones in the retina. Premature trunca- tion of RD3 that occurs in LCA12 patients and, in a similar manner, in rd3 mice eliminates RD3 and reduces the content of RetGC in the outer segment. The latter becomes restored upon transgenic expression of RD3 in homozygous rd3 mice. There are strong indications that RD3 is directly involved in facilitating the intracellular transport of RetGC from the inner to the outer segment. However, the lack of effective transport of RetGC to the outer segment in RD3-deficient photoreceptors cannot solely account for the severe and rapid death of the rd3 rods and cones, because these photoreceptors still possess low but detectable levels of RetGC activity and can produce a diminished yet clearly detectable photoresponse.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30559291","rdfs:label":"Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/dd0a231b-9fe2-43d4-8740-66068c0e6346","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/28ad4806-89d8-4003-9fb2-2addd778cdd4","type":"Finding","dc:description":"They custom-synthesized an anti-human RD3 antibody, characterized its specificity, and investigated the expression and localization of RD3 in several human tissues.
