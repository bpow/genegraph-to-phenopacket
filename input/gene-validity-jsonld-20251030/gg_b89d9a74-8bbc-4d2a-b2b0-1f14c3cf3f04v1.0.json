The variant segregated with disease in 10 members of one family. The affected individuals present with moderate to profound postlingual nonsyndromic hearing loss. The mechanism of pathogenicity is unclear. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by an expression study demonstrating ABCC1 localization on the stria vascularis as well as auditory nerves with a cytomembrane distribution (PMID: 31273342). Mouse models have also suggested a role for this gene in hearing loss, but relevant phenotypes were only observed following noise exposure (PMIDs: 38870779, 38951883). In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hearing Loss GCEP on the meeting date October 8, 2025 (SOP Version 11).\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b89d9a74-8bbc-4d2a-b2b0-1f14c3cf3f04","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cdf6b5bc-f8f6-46f5-abc1-c336cd9121be","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cdf6b5bc-f8f6-46f5-abc1-c336cd9121be_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2025-10-28T14:50:33.377Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cdf6b5bc-f8f6-46f5-abc1-c336cd9121be_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2025-10-08T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cdf6b5bc-f8f6-46f5-abc1-c336cd9121be_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/665f72e1-b0e0-4c9b-868f-425e9cda3efa","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/665f72e1-b0e0-4c9b-868f-425e9cda3efa_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"In vitro functional expression studies of patient-derived lymphoblastoid cells showed decreased efflux capacity of an ABCC1 substrate compared to controls.
