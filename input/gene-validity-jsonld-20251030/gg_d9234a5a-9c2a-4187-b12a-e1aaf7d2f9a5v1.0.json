At least 30 missense variants have been reported in humans. Association is seen in at least 11 probands in 11 publications (PMIDs: 11354642, 11912510, 15337980, 20937258, 21868108, 9856479, 9620796, 10369869, 10807696, 16226720, 28102197). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 49 additional family members. Much more evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence and/or experimental evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. This gene-disease association is supported by animal models, expression studies, in vitro functional assays, and biochemical functional studies, which support a dominant-negative mechanism of disease. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in molecular mechanism and inheritance pattern for AD nonsyndromic hearing loss, AD keratitis ichthyosis deafness (KID) and AD palmoplantar keratoderma (PPK) with deafness. It is possible that these phenotypes exist on a spectrum of disease. In summary, GJB2 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant Hearing Loss with or without Skin Findings. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hearing Loss Working Group on 6/26/2018.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d9234a5a-9c2a-4187-b12a-e1aaf7d2f9a5","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9d7b8505-4def-4b99-a8a2-853c07e9969e","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9d7b8505-4def-4b99-a8a2-853c07e9969e_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2018-06-26T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9d7b8505-4def-4b99-a8a2-853c07e9969e_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9d7b8505-4def-4b99-a8a2-853c07e9969e_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9d7b8505-4def-4b99-a8a2-853c07e9969e_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0bec3fd5-d240-4a0e-8d06-abe50d6dc70a","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/89dc7ae9-5bda-4fd1-99c5-fc70c5168a9e","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Performed in vivo transfection of the mutant GJB2-R75W-eGFP into adult mouse cochlea.

Hearing was not tested in this study, but the mice line was found to be severely hearing impaired through ABR testing in another study (Schultz 2011 20926451). Mice also have dry, scaly skin. In newborn and adult Cx26S17F mice, lipids accumulate in dot-like pattern in the stratum corneum (likely lipid inclusions), while lipids are evenly distributed in extracellular lipid lamellae in control mice. Lipids were also found to be prematurely secreted in the stratum granulosum. Also observed large amounts of calcium intra- and extracellular of the stratum corneum, as well as in the stratum corneum/stratum granulosum junction. In controls, the stratum grandulosum contained a high amount of calcium but the stratum corneum was completely calcium-free. Conclusion: Cx26S17F variant likely triggers hyperproliferation of epidermis indirectly after birth due to an epidermal barrier defect during embryonic development. Hyperproliferation is likely a stress response to the defect, aka varied lipid properties and disturbed calcium gradient.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26070424","rdfs:label":"Bosen Animal Model","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9d7b8505-4def-4b99-a8a2-853c07e9969e_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1bd24506-6c5d-4d8b-b782-7893ecd79520","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"There are numerous additional studies providing evidence that dominant variants that cause hearing loss alone in GJB2 exert a dominant negative effect on wild type connexin 26 and result in partial or full loss of gap junction function","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1a35ec36-29a6-4ee7-8752-e73c6ac929d8","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"None of the following variants affect the trafficking and localization of WT Cx26: W44C, W44S, G59A, R75Q, R75W, R139Q, D179N, R184Q, C202F.
