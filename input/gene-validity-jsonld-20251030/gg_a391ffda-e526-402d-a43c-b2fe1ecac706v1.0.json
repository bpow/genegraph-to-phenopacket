The *COX4I2* gene encodes an isoform of a subunit of cytochrome *c* oxidase (COX) that is expressed in lung and pancreatic acinar cells.\n\n*COX4I2* was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive primary mitochondrial disease in 2009 (PMID: 19268275) in two unrelated probands with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, dyserythropoeitic anemia, and calvarial hyperostosis. While various names have been given to the constellation of features seen in those with *COX4I2*-related disease, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *COX4I2* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework.\n\nEvidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included one homozygous missense variant seen in both probands. Of note, this variant has a relatively high allele frequency in gnomAD v4.0.0 (allele frequency 0.0003940, including two homozygotes). This Expert Panel elected to include these cases at minimal scoring given that the variant frequency did not seem sufficiently high enough to entirely exclude the variants as causative and the shared phenotype of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency and dyserythropoeitic anemia is unique.\n\nThe mechanism of disease is loss of function This gene-disease association is also supported by its known biochemical function of *COX4I2* as a subunit of complex IV, functional alteration in non-patient cells (PMID: 32075102), and a knockout mouse model (PMID: 22730437).\n\nIn summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on March 18, 2024 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a391ffda-e526-402d-a43c-b2fe1ecac706","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a77de2a3-bc6f-47fc-a56c-edee31e11dcb","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a77de2a3-bc6f-47fc-a56c-edee31e11dcb_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2025-01-14T18:11:06.486Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a77de2a3-bc6f-47fc-a56c-edee31e11dcb_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2024-03-18T04:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a77de2a3-bc6f-47fc-a56c-edee31e11dcb_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a77de2a3-bc6f-47fc-a56c-edee31e11dcb_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1965a2d4-08a3-4201-9bab-f3fda8cd3b07","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Score only 0.5 points for reduction of COX activity in lung, with discrepant results regarding the pancreatic studies in mice vs humans","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/93d9e124-514a-404a-896f-af17f7badd7d","type":"Finding","dc:description":"linked only by COX activity \n\nNotably, In the COX4i2-knockout mice, the pancreas histology was indistinguishable from the wild-type mice and showed no signs of dysfunction (Supplemental Fig. S4C).
