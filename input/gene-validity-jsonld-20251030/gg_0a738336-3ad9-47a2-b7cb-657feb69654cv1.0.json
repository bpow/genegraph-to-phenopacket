MAPK8IP3 was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant MAPK8IP3-related neurodevelopmental disorders in 2019 (Platzer et al., PMID: 30612693).  7 variants (including 4 missense, 2 nonsense, and 1 frameshift) have been reported in 9 probands in 2 publications (PMID: 30612693; Iwasawa et al., 2019, PMID: 30945334) and are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of the disease is not yet established. However, it is known that the protein encoded by MAPK8IP3 acts as a regulator of vesicle transport and promotes neuronal axon elongation in a kinesin- and JNK-dependent manner. Both missense variants located in functional domains and null variants, all of which are de novo, are implicated in disease. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence (e.g. animal models, rescue and expression studies) (Gowrishankar et al., 2017, PMID: 28784610; PMID: 30612693). In summary, MAPK8IP3 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant MAPK8IP3-related neurodevelopmental disorder with or without variable brain abnormalities. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Syndromic Disorders Gene Curation Expert Panel on the meeting date 10.26.2021 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0a738336-3ad9-47a2-b7cb-657feb69654c","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7af4bd87-1d3d-4e52-929f-c3893f81c38a","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7af4bd87-1d3d-4e52-929f-c3893f81c38a_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10060","date":"2022-05-22T06:40:09.503Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7af4bd87-1d3d-4e52-929f-c3893f81c38a_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10060","date":"2022-05-22T06:39:58.942Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7af4bd87-1d3d-4e52-929f-c3893f81c38a_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6dd3a229-831a-4822-a286-5db8a9643967","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6dd3a229-831a-4822-a286-5db8a9643967_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30612693","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/dbb8c35a-8ab3-4eb1-aa2d-caa86b51a06a","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_015133.5(MAPK8IP3):c.65del (p.Gly22fs)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA913190363"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:DeNovoAlleleOrigin"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:Heterozygous"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/83f740ec-81c4-4b62-88e0-f901ab0ff8ce","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/83f740ec-81c4-4b62-88e0-f901ab0ff8ce_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"The Arg1146 residue is located in the WD40 repeat domain.

Previous studies have shown that unc-16 loss-of-function mutations are recessive and are associated with sluggish locomotion and impaired clearance of organelles from axons. In C.elegans mutants lacking UNC-16, axonal transport is disrupted resulting in a subset of cell soma organelles, including lysosomes, early endosomes,and Golgi, to aberrantly enter axons and accumulate in the synaptic region. To determine the functional impact of six MAPK8IP3 variants identified in affected individuals (in the same study), CRISPR genome editing was used to engineer the six variants (including five missense variants) onto the native C. elegans unc-16 gene. The mutant strains were assayed for locomotion function and lysosome accumulation in the axons (Fig 3). The strains were compared to wildtype. The unc-16 reference null mutant (p.Asn316Ter in humans) served as a negative control. To control for off-target effects, CRISPR genome editing was again used to reverse-engineer each mutant allele back to its wild-type sequence. These ‘‘rescued’’ alleles were subjected to the same assays (Fig 3). The Tyr37Ter variant (p.Tyr49Ter in C.elegans) showed 88-fold higher axonal lysosomal density, which was completely rescued by wild-type (Fig 3B and C).This mutant also had a swimming rate similar to the null allele (Fig 3D). The p.Leu444Pro variant (p.Leu393Pro in C. elegans) showed 15-fold higher axonal lysosomal density, which could be rescued by wild-type allele (Fig 3B and C) and a swimming rate 50% of wild-type (Fig 3D). The other four missense variants: p.Tyr94Cys, p.Glu461Gly, p.Arg525Gln and p.Arg1146Cys did not significantly affect lysosomal density (Fig 3B and C), but three of them (p.Tyr94Cys, p.Glu461Gly, p.Arg525Gln) did affect swimming rates in a minor (6-7% reduction) but significant manner.","functionalDataSupport":"Yes"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1b565a3b-592d-4015-8fa0-849a580c2d91_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30612693","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/75f43392-a8fd-4245-98ed-d6c2416ce51b","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_015133.5(MAPK8IP3):c.1574G>A (p.Arg525Gln)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA394232156"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:DeNovoAlleleOrigin"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:Heterozygous"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fbeb558d-3e8f-4634-89df-f0c0f96113f7","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fbeb558d-3e8f-4634-89df-f0c0f96113f7_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"The Arg1146 residue is located in the WD40 repeat domain.

But certain components of the axonal transport machinery, such as the dynein\nheavy chain 1 (DYNC1H1) and BICD2 have also been implicated in childhood-onset neurodevelopmental disorders comprising ID and a spectrum of malformations of cortical development (MCD), such as lissencephaly and (bilateral perisylvian) polymicrogyria.
