Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in the molecular mechanism or inheritance pattern of these diseases. Therefore, these three disease entities have been lumped into a single disease entity, named CACNA1F-related retinopathy for the gene curation of *CACNA1F*.\n\n17 suspected pathogenic variants (six missense, one in-frame indel, five nonsense, two frameshift, and three splicing) that have been reported in 17 probands across seven publications (PMIDs: 16505158, 11281458, 26992781, 22194652, 12111638, 23714322, and 9662400) are included in this curation. Each proband was a hemizygous male. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be monoallelic loss of function.\n\nThis gene-disease association is also supported by experimental evidence that *CACNA1F* exhibits its highest expression levels in retina tissue, specifically the outer plexiform layer of retina cells (PMIDs: 9662400, 9662399, 11527958). *Cacna1f* knockout mice exhibit absence of scotopic b-wave and normal a-wave in ERG recordings; significantly reduced calcium signaling; reduced Cacna1f, M-opsin and S-opsin expression in the retina and reduced thickness of the outer plexiform layer of the retina (PMIDs: 16155113, 30445045). \n\nIn summary, *CACNA1F* is definitively associated with X-linked inheritance of CACNA1F-related retinopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Retina GCEP on January 5th, 2023 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/aa75779b-0727-45e4-9095-c7d8c684c76c","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c7800cd0-11d8-4e50-85f0-04574c8798f4","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c7800cd0-11d8-4e50-85f0-04574c8798f4_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10072","date":"2023-01-05T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c7800cd0-11d8-4e50-85f0-04574c8798f4_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10072","date":"2024-06-29T03:52:24.440Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["DiseaseNameUpdate"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c7800cd0-11d8-4e50-85f0-04574c8798f4_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c7800cd0-11d8-4e50-85f0-04574c8798f4_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2eaa3c3a-efd0-45ee-9f82-7500376cf08b","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d280c8c3-320c-4352-8178-bcfb95a6b287","type":"Finding","dc:description":"α1F protein was shown to be highly expressed in the OPL of the rat retina\n\nPhotoreceptor active zones in the OPL double labeled with antibodies against α1F and bassoon, a component of photoreceptor synaptic ribbons.
