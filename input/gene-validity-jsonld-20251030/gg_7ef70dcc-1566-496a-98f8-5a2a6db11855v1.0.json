{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7ef70dcc-1566-496a-98f8-5a2a6db11855v1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"The relationship between GRIN1 and autosomal dominant (AD) complex neurodevelopmental disorder was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of 11/19/2018. Variants in GRIN1 were first reported in humans with this disease as early as 2011 (Hamdan et al., PMID: 21376300). At least 16 variants (e.g. missense, in-frame indel, in-frame duplications) have been reported in humans (PMID: 21376300, 27164704, 25864721, 28228639). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes de novo case-level data, and experimental data. Of note, there are animal models supporting that loss of function of the GRIN1 protein results in complex neurodevelopmental disorder, but these models are full knockouts that are used to support the gene's association with autosomal recessive disease. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 33 probands in 4 publications (PMID: 21376300, 27164704, 25864721, 28228639). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism for disease is predicted to be dominant negative/haploinsufficiency (PMID: 27164704). Of note, this gene has also been implicated in causing disease in an autosomal recessive pattern. This will be assessed separately. This gene-disease association is supported by in vitro functional assays showing that the de novo variants may cause a dominant negative impact resulting in a loss of function of the transmembrane domain (PMID: 27164704). In summary, GRIN1 is definitively associated with AD complex neurodevelopmental disorder. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7ef70dcc-1566-496a-98f8-5a2a6db11855","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b98e5df5-8f39-4fd6-9715-bb8da7dc1806","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b98e5df5-8f39-4fd6-9715-bb8da7dc1806_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10005","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b98e5df5-8f39-4fd6-9715-bb8da7dc1806_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10005","date":"2018-11-20T05:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b98e5df5-8f39-4fd6-9715-bb8da7dc1806_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b98e5df5-8f39-4fd6-9715-bb8da7dc1806_ad_dn_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2763e801-5a71-4e61-aee1-14b0a7700db7_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"This variant was found to reduce maximal agonist-inducible currents (complete LoF) and was found in a de novo case with a complex neurodevelopmental disorder.
