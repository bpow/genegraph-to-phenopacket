Six variants (5 missense, 1 nonsense) that have been reported in six probands in five publications (PMIDs: 28973288, 29329447, 30414530, 33729509, 31294511) are included in this curation. Variants were reported to be de novo for all cases in which parents were available for testing; for two of the missense variants, supporting evidence for reduced function is available (PMIDs: 28973288, 29329447). Thus far, reported missense variants appear to cluster in or near the forkhead domain, which may affect the DNA binding ability of this transcriptional activator (PMID: 33729509). At least two probands with a similar phenotype and de novo deletions encompassing FOXA2 have been reported, but were not scored in this curation (PMIDs: 31294511, 32277595). Therefore, the mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be LOF leading to haploinsufficiency. This gene-disease association is also supported by expression studies in both mouse and human embryos (PMID: 28973288). In summary, there is moderate evidence to support the relationship between FOXA2 and autosomal dominant combined pituitary hormone deficiencies. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Brain Malformations gene curation expert panel on 22.Nov.2022.
