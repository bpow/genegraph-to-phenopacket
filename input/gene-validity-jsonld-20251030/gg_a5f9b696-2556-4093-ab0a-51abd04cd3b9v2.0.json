This condition is characterized by recurrent infection, dysmorphic facial features, developmental delay, cytogenetic abnormalities on chromosomes 1,9, and 16, and hypomethylation of alpha satellite regions. Six variants (frameshift, in frame deletion, missense, nonsense, and splice site) have been reported in five probands in two publications (PMIDs: 26216346, 30511102). Variants segregated with disease in two families. Heterozygous parents and siblings were unaffected. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss of function. \n\nThis gene-disease association is also supported by biochemical function, GTEx bulk tissue expression showing that HELLS is greatly expressed in EBV transformed lymphocytes and other highly proliferative tissues such as the testis, and a co-immunoprecipitation assay demonstrated that HELLS interacts with CDCA7, which is associated with ICF type 3 (PMIDs:23715323, 36012581, 30307408). Additionally, the gene-disease relationship is supported by several cell culture and animal models, including a conditional mouse model which showed that knocked out LSH (mouse orthologue of HELLS) recapitulated a core immunological phenotype of reduced Ig levels (PMID: 32727902). Other cell culture models demonstrated that knock down HELLS recapitulated phenotypes of centromeric hypomethylation (PMID:26216346), while another model suggests HELLS may effect NHEJ, which may reflect a deficiency in class switch recombination observed in patients (PMID:32727902). In summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged. \n\nThis classification was originally approved by the ClinGen SCID-CID GCEP on 4/20/2023. This gene-disease relationship was re-evaluated on 4/16/2025. As a result of this re-evaluation, no new evidence was identified and the classification did not change (SOP Version 11).

Knock down of HELLS, Zbtb24, and Cdca7 and knock out of DNMT3B resulted in hypomethylation of centromeric repeats. Hypomethylation of these centromeric repeats may be responsible for the wide ranging phenotypes observed in ICF syndrome through a shared pathway involving methylation.

This result suggests that HELLS may be important to the efficient functioning of NHEJ, which normally functions in class switch recombination to join the variable domain exon to the a specific constant domain exon in the heavy chain of antibodies. The authors suggest that a deficiency in this mechanism during class switch recombination may be an underlying cause of Ig deficiency observed in individuals with ICF4.

HELLS -/- mice die perinatally and display multiple organ and stem cell defects. Under two conditional HELLS knock out mouse models, there were normal levels of peripheral B cells, but a decrease in the expression of Immunoglobins in response to in vitro stimulation, suggesting biallelic variants in HELLS result in a deficiency underlying class switch recombination. The conditional knock out HELLS mouse models were independently able to recapitulate the core immunodeficient phenotype observed in humans of hypogammaglobulinemia, but other features of ICF4 such as facial abnormalities were either not observed or noted.
