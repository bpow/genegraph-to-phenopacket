Three missense variants have been reported in a pair of siblings with the limb-girdle phenotype in the literature; this is the only report known to have been published of a *LIMS2* variant identified in a patient with autosomal recessive limb-girdle muscular dystrophy. None of these variants have functional evidence in support of pathogenicity and the mechanism for disease is unknown. \n\nClinVar contains submissions for variants within this gene; the panel contacted submitters of pathogenic and likely pathogenic ClinVar contributions and found no additional evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. \n\nThe loxP/Cre system was used to knock out *LIMS2* in a mouse model. The resulting *LIMS2* deficient mice showed no apparent phenotype when compared to their wild-type and heterozygous littermates (PMID:16317048). RNA sequencing of total RNA from 20 human tissues shows non-specific expression of *LIMS2* in skeletal muscle, low to moderate in comparison to expression in other tissues (NCBI Bioproject:PRJNA280600).\n\nThe evidence of this gene-disease relationship is limited to a few cases carrying missense variants and presenting with genetically heterogeneous phenotypes with a sum of genetic evidence below 0. No compelling experimental evidence is available. \n\nIn summary, the evidence supporting the relationship between *LIMS2* and autosomal recessive limb-girdle muscular dystrophy has been disputed and no valid evidence remains to support the claim. More evidence is needed to either support or entirely refute the role *LIMS2* plays in this disease.\n\nThis classification was approved by the ClinGen Muscular Dystrophies and Myopathies Gene Curation Expert Panel on the meeting date November 12, 2024 (SOP Version 11).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/48e7117a-53cb-4f63-b018-183f2a7e84f3","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/00284b9e-fc0e-4667-ad1b-fd68f2cdc490","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/00284b9e-fc0e-4667-ad1b-fd68f2cdc490_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10151","date":"2024-11-12T20:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/00284b9e-fc0e-4667-ad1b-fd68f2cdc490_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10151","date":"2024-11-20T18:47:50.924Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"The evidence of this gene-disease relationship is limited to a few cases carrying missense variants and presenting with genetically heterogeneous phenotypes with a sum of genetic evidence below 0.
