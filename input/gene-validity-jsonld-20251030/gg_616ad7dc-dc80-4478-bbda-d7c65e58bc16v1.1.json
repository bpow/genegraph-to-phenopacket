{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/616ad7dc-dc80-4478-bbda-d7c65e58bc16v1.1","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"The *USP27X* gene encodes a deubiquitinase highly expressed in the brain. To date, three variants in *USP27X* have been published in two large exome sequencing studies of families with X-linked intellectual disability. In 2016, Hu et al. (PMID: 25644381) reported a frameshift variant in a multigenerational family with three affected males with borderline to moderate ID, variable absent or poor speech, and behavioral problems. They also reported a missense variant in a family with four affected males, but only one was genotyped. This variant was not scored as there is insufficient evidence to support its pathogenicity. In 2019, Sanchis-Juan et al. (PMID: 31316545) reported a different frameshift variant in two half-siblings with developmental delay and intellectual disability, as well as dysmorphic facial features in one individual.\n\nClinVar contains one record of a likely pathogenic nonsense variant related to a neurodevelopmental disorder (Variation ID: 1321965). In the absence of additional information about the phenotype and the presence of other pathogenic variants, this variant was not scored. Additionally, DECIPHER has a *de novo* missense variant  in an individual with global developmental delay and mild intellectual disability who also carries a pathogenic frameshift variant in *SHANK3*, implicated in Phelan-McDermid syndrome (DECIPHER Patient ID: 482675). Therefore, the role of the variant in *USP27X* cannot be determined and was not scored. *USP27X* is constrained for both loss-of-function and missense variants (pLI 0.92 and missense Z score 3.18, gnomAD V2.1.1). No experimental evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship was identified.\nIn summary, there is limited evidence at this time to support the relationship between *USP27X* and X-linked intellectual disability. Additional studies are required to verify this gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel on February 1, 2023 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/616ad7dc-dc80-4478-bbda-d7c65e58bc16","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f6aeec40-3974-4c03-8ac3-8f0fdd614d41","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","changes":{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f6aeec40-3974-4c03-8ac3-8f0fdd614d41_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2023-05-25T14:24:50.557Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f6aeec40-3974-4c03-8ac3-8f0fdd614d41_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2023-02-01T19:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f6aeec40-3974-4c03-8ac3-8f0fdd614d41_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f6aeec40-3974-4c03-8ac3-8f0fdd614d41_seg_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/dcb81697-78bb-4112-bdc5-6cd0023d1611_proband_segregation","type":"FamilyCosegregation","dc:description":"Missense variant not scored because insufficient information to determine pathogenicity\n","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25644381","rdfs:label":"L75","estimatedLodScore":0.6,"family":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/dcb81697-78bb-4112-bdc5-6cd0023d1611","type":"Family","rdfs:label":"L75","member":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/83f236f9-adb0-4839-9fe2-1cbfef9b7a1f","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25644381","rdfs:label":"II-6","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7f4fc4bd-edbf-49a2-9d4b-6778ac0856d0","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001145073.3(USP27X):c.1141T>C (p.Tyr381His)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA10586700"}},"phenotypes":["obo:HP_0000708","obo:HP_0001344","obo:HP_0002465","obo:HP_0002342","obo:HP_0006889"],"sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cfed0ca7-3da7-4718-826e-58ca2621336d_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25644381","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7f4fc4bd-edbf-49a2-9d4b-6778ac0856d0"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:Hemizygous"}}}},"meetsInclusionCriteria":false,"phenotypeFreeText":"Family with four affected individuals.
