(PMID: 25232744). TBR1 has also been associated with intellectual developmental disorder with autism and speech delay (OMIM #606053), 2q24 microdeletion syndrome, occipital pachygyria and polymicrogyria. Since then, phenotypes associated with variants in TBR1 have been expanded and range from autism spectrum disorder, delayed speech and language development, joint hypermobility, severe intellectual disability/global developmental delay, abnormality of the skull, cerebral palsy, etc. (Deriziotis et al., 2014 PMID: 25232744; Huang et al., 2014 PMID: 24441682; Palumbo et al., 2014 PMID:24458984).Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, the ID/Autism GCEP decided to lump into one disease entity, complex neurodevelopmental disorder (Mondo:0100038). There are individuals that have been reported with other phenotypes including joint hypermobility and muscle dysfunction. It is unclear at this time whether these phenotypes are related to variants in TBR1 or are due to other circumstances. Most proband information was collected from large case control studies where other phenotypic features are not reported, therefore making the phenotypic profile unclear.\n\nTwenty-six variants (missense, in-frame indel, frameshift) have been included in this curation. These variants have been reported in thirty-two individuals across two publications (PMIDs: 25232744, 32005960).More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be LOF. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by protein interactions, expression studies, animal models, and biochemical function studies (PMIDs: 25232744, 24309898, 10749215, 32005960). In summary, TBR1 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant complex neurodevelopmental disorder. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This curation was approved by the ID/Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel on 03/25/2020.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/11675308-2f06-49cb-a56c-ca868672a9b4","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/853c90ef-34a8-4d7d-931d-5fb4add3e4d0","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/853c90ef-34a8-4d7d-931d-5fb4add3e4d0_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2020-12-23T15:48:53.622Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/853c90ef-34a8-4d7d-931d-5fb4add3e4d0_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2020-03-25T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/853c90ef-34a8-4d7d-931d-5fb4add3e4d0_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/853c90ef-34a8-4d7d-931d-5fb4add3e4d0_ad_other_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2deedddb-f660-405c-bcf6-9f63703d0ec5_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The p.P542RR variant lies within a the CASK binding region of TBR1, 3’ to the T-box.

According to this article the heterozygous Tbr1 (+/-) mice showed deficits in learning and memory using the conditioned taste aversion assay (Figure 5A, PMID: 24441682) and auditory fear conditioning (Figure 5b, PMID: 24441682). the Tbr1 +/- mice did not recognize sucrose as a hazard after LiCl treatment indicating learning impairment. For the auditory fear conditioning the Tbr1+/- mice showed a lower freezing response compared to wildtype littermates. No change in behavior were observed in the Tbr1+/- mice compared to wildtypes in the open-field, elevated plus maze, novel object recognition, or contextual fear.\n\nThee mice have been studied and reference in 17 papers according to MGI: http://www.informatics.jax.org/reference/allele/MGI:2179766?typeFilter=Literature","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32005960","rdfs:label":"Tbr1 null mice have cortical malformations and behavioral de","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":1641,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria7","strengthScore":16,"subject":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/_0AhJ9af5L8","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0100038","gene":"hgnc:11590","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"1.1","websiteLegacyID":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/assertion_853c90ef-34a8-4d7d-931d-5fb4add3e4d0-","@context":{"@vocab":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"},"curationReasons":{"@type":"@vocab","@container":"@set"},"GCISnapshot":{"@type":"@id"},"dc:isVersionOf":{"@type":"@id"},"websiteLegacyID":{"@type":"@id"}}}
