{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0cf9f7f1-6ad2-44ae-8607-401324c67eafv2.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"TTN was originally evaluated for DCM by ClinGen DCM GCEP on September 29, 2020. Evidence of the association of this gene with DCM was re-evaluated on 3/19/2025. As a result, the classification did not change. A summary of the information contributing to the classification of t/he gene at the time of re-evaluation is summarized herein.\n\nTitin (TTN) was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) in 2002 (Gerull et al, 2002, PMID: 22335739). Human genetic evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, case-control data and segregation data. Over 100 truncating TTN variants (TTNtv) have been reported in humans with DCM (Gerull et al, 2006, PMID: 16733766; Herman et al, 2012 PMID: 22335739; Norton et al, 2013, PMID: 23418287; Akinrinade et al, 2015, PMID: 26084686; Franaszczyk et al, 2017, PMID: 28045875; Akinrinade et al, 2019, PMID: 30858397; Cannatà et al, 2022, PMID: 35138330; Massier, 2025, PMID: 39844436). Strong case-control data has been reported in a study comparing the frequency of TTNtv in large populations of healthy volunteers and DCM patients (Roberts et al, 2015, PMID: 25589632; Haggerty et al, 2019, PMID: 31216868). In addition, this gene-disease association is supported by experimental data including animal models (zebrafish – Xu et al, 2002, PMID: 11788825; mouse – Gramlich et al, 2009, PMID: 19406126 and rat – Schafer et al, 2017, PMID: 27869827); human induced pluripotent stem cell studies (Hinson et al, 2015, PMID: 26315439) and phenotype rescue experiments in animal models and human induced pluripotent stem cells from DCM patients (Gramlich et al, 2015, PMID: 25759365). Ghahremani et al (2024, PMID: 38235591) showed that in human iPSC models TTN CRISPR activation rescued TTN truncating variants-related functional deficits (normalized sarcomere content and contractile function). Additional evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence and/or experimental evidence has been reached. TTN has also been curated by the Congenital Myopathies gene curation expert group for TTN-related myopathy (Definitive, 01/11/2022), the Congenital Myopathies gene curation expert group for tibial muscular dystrophy (Moderate, 03/14/2022), the Congenital Myopathies gene curation expert group for myopathy, myofibrillar, 9, with early respiratory failure (Moderate, 03/14/2022), the Hereditary Cardiovascular Disease gene curation expert group for HCM (Limited, 07/27/2023), and the Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy gene curation expert group for ARVC (Limited, 08/06/2019).  In summary, truncating variants TTN are definitively associated with autosomal dominant DCM. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Dilated Cardiomyopathy Working Group on September 29, 2020 (SOP Version 7). This written summary was updated on 3/19/2025 and approved by the DCM GCEP on 05/30/2025.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0cf9f7f1-6ad2-44ae-8607-401324c67eaf","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1ec53217-814e-44b3-a7b7-0f18311c20f3","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":[{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"},{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},{"id":"cg:sopChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1ec53217-814e-44b3-a7b7-0f18311c20f3_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10035","date":"2025-05-30T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1ec53217-814e-44b3-a7b7-0f18311c20f3_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10035","date":"2025-08-07T12:21:52.224Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["RecurationTiming"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1ec53217-814e-44b3-a7b7-0f18311c20f3_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1ec53217-814e-44b3-a7b7-0f18311c20f3_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9b0fd470-070f-4d74-aa7f-cd12d56b3ed9","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9bd9c56c-ad3f-4152-b2b2-df00f37ac8ed","type":"Finding","dc:description":"The truncated protein of approximately 2 mD is expressed in\nskeletal muscle, but western blot studies with epitope-specific\nanti-titin antibodies suggest that the mutant protein is\ntruncated to a 1.14-mD subfragment by site-specific cleavage.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11788824","rdfs:label":"WESTERN BLOTTING","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionB"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1ec53217-814e-44b3-a7b7-0f18311c20f3_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/46b9b0f0-be32-4532-a502-5121a57e578e","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c92821e3-f2c5-46de-bd51-225fa3b20cba","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Immunocytochemical analysis for titin and various proteins marking different\nportions of the sarcomere—a-actinin (Z-disk), cardiac troponin T\n(cTNT, A-band), and myosin heavy chain (MHC, M-line)—revealed, in the DCM group, a higher percentage of cardiomyocytes in which organized myofibrils occupied only half of the whole cytoplasm or less .
