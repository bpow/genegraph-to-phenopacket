Variants in APOB were first reported in relation to familial hypobetalipoproteinemia (FHBL) in 1988 (Young et al, PMID 3399894; Collins et al, PMID 2843815). FHBL is characterized by plasma LDL-cholesterol that are <5th percentile. The condition is inherited in a semi-dominant (co-dominant) manner and is typically caused by variants in APOB that result in the production of truncated forms of apoB100, a structural component of very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) and low density lipoproteins (LDL). Heterozygotes are usually asymptomatic but may develop hepatic steatosis. Homozygotes have extremely low LDL-cholesterol levels and may have symptoms varying from none to severe neurological and gastrointestinal dysfunction (For reviews, see PMIDs 1977530, 8527219, 12639976, 15308601, 15818469, 24751931). Over 60 unique variants in APOB in individuals with hypobetalipoproteinemia have been reported (PMID 22588666). The majority are nonsense and frameshift variants resulting in truncated forms of apoB. However, missense and small inframe deletions have also been reported (Burnett et al, 2003 PMID 12551903; Magnolo et al, 2016, PMID 26825690). Eleven unique variants in this gene were curated from six publications in 8 monoallelic and 2 biallelic probands (Collins et al, 1988, PMID 2843815; Farese et al, 1992, PMID 1527480; Huang et al, 1992, PMID 1770316; Burnett et al, 2003 PMID 12551903; Magnolo et al, 2016, PMID 26825690; Rimbert et al, 2016, PMID 27179706). Segregation evidence from two large families was also curated (Farese et al, 1992, PMID 1527480; Burnett et al, 2003 PMID 12551903). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. This gene-disease relationship is supported by the well characterized function of apoB (reviewed in Whitefield et al, 2004, PMID 15308601), expression of the gene in liver (https://gtexportal.org/home/gene/APOB), functional alteration experiments (Srivastava et al, 1999, PMID 10224159), and animal models (Kim et al, 1998, PMID 9502790; Chen et al, 2004, PMID 13130124). Additional experimental evidence to support the gene-disease relationship is available in the literature but the maximum experimental evidence score (6 points) has been reached. Of note, this gene has also been implicated in familial hypercholesterolemia (FH); the clinical validity of APOB-FH has been assessed separately by ClinGen. In summary, APOB is definitively associated with FHBL. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen General Gene Curation Expert Panel.\nLUMPING AND SPLITTING CONSIDERATIONS: In OMIM, APOB is associated with two disease entities – Hypercholesterolemia, familial, 2 (MIM# 144010) and hypobetalipoproteinemia (MIM# 615558). Per the criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, there are differences in the molecular mechanism and phenotypic presentation for these conditions. Missense variants in the LDL-receptor binding domain of apoB impair binding of LDL to the LDL receptor, causing hypercholesterolemia and premature coronary artery disease, the primary features of FH. In contrast, variants resulting in reduced secretion of APOB (mainly nonsense and frameshift variants) cause familial hypobetalipoproteinemia, which is characterized by hypocholesterolemia and resistance to atherosclerosis. Therefore, these two disease entities have been curated separately for their relationship with APOB.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1bf7e2fd-2377-467f-bfca-bbc220f6c5d5","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e7382aae-83d5-4a23-b1fe-e3d6acea8584","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e7382aae-83d5-4a23-b1fe-e3d6acea8584_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10026","date":"2021-01-08T13:17:21.704Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e7382aae-83d5-4a23-b1fe-e3d6acea8584_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10026","date":"2020-02-26T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e7382aae-83d5-4a23-b1fe-e3d6acea8584_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cc09a291-d63c-4abf-89ea-c471823915ab_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"This individual and an effected sibling are compound heterozygous for two loss of function variants in APOB (c.537+1G>T and p.Arg439Ter).

In summary, APOB (apolipoprotein B) is known to play an important role in human lipoprotein metabolism. Two isoforms of apoB are produced from the APOB gene by a unique posttranscriptional editing process: apoB-48, which is required for chylomicron production in the small intestine, and apoB-100, which is an important structural component of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) and its metabolic products, intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL) and low density lipoprotein (LDL). ApoB-100 is also a ligand for receptor-mediated endocytosis of LDL. VLDL assembly in the liver depends on the coordinated synthesis of apoB-100 and lipids. Therefore, if the synthesis and/or secretion of apoB-100 is impaired the levels of LDL-cholesterol are predicted to be low, as is the case in familial hypobetalipoproteinemia. \nFatty liver has been reported in individuals with FHBL who are heterozygous or biallelic (homozygous or compound heterozygous) for APOB variant(s). It is thought that impaired VLDL assembly leads to accumulation of lipids in hepatocytes, causing fatty liver. In fact, magnetic resonance spectroscopy studies have shown FHBL heterozygotes were have a liver fat content 3 x higher than control individuals (see PMID 14967820).","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15308601","rdfs:label":"Function of APOB-100","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e7382aae-83d5-4a23-b1fe-e3d6acea8584_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/484dea78-1157-4e30-8636-c2c2516a8c3d","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"These results are included under \"functional alteration\" evidence because they provide an explanation for the lower-than-expected apoB expression that is noted in patients with FHBL who are heterozygous for loss of function variants.","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7f2d9866-f29c-4610-8693-550ed7e2caa2","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"The APOB gene of HepG2 cells was targeted by homologous recombination in order to generate a truncated form of apoB, apoB-82.

Furthermore, hepatic triglyceride secretion rates were reduced by ∼50% in the mice, similar to the level in humans (PMID 10559016).\nContinuous labeling and pulse-chase experiments in primary hepatocyte cultures revealed that rates of apoB-100 synthesis by Apobec-1(-/-)/Apob(38.9/+) and Apob(38.9/100) hepatocytes were reduced to the expected 50% of those of the respective controls, but the efficiency of secretion of apoB-100 was significantly lower in apoB-38.9 heterozygous hepatocytes, consistent with the observations of lower than expected apoB levels in human who are heterozygous for loss of function variants.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/13130124","rdfs:label":"Apo-B38.9 mouse model","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":3}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":6}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":1677,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria7","strengthScore":18,"subject":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cHQRVrXJkA8","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0014252","gene":"hgnc:603","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0032113"},"version":"1.1","websiteLegacyID":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/assertion_e7382aae-83d5-4a23-b1fe-e3d6acea8584-","@context":{"@vocab":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"},"curationReasons":{"@type":"@vocab","@container":"@set"},"GCISnapshot":{"@type":"@id"},"dc:isVersionOf":{"@type":"@id"},"websiteLegacyID":{"@type":"@id"}}}
