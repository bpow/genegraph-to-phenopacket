One unique missense variant has been reported in two related probands in one publication (PMIDs: 35737725). The gene-disease relationship is supported by expression evidence and a knockout mouse model that shows *Bmp9*-mutant mice injected with anti-Bmp10 antibodies display patent ductus arteriosus (PMIDs: 23715323, 26056270). In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Congenital Heart Disease GCEP on the meeting date 09/11/2023 (SOP Version 9) ","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a9c31af4-f957-4949-af87-7ded8f255025","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d1da0a68-cf08-4de9-8461-0808826679bd","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d1da0a68-cf08-4de9-8461-0808826679bd_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10130","date":"2023-09-18T18:05:43.159Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d1da0a68-cf08-4de9-8461-0808826679bd_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10130","date":"2023-09-11T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d1da0a68-cf08-4de9-8461-0808826679bd_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f789e894-e52b-4bde-afb6-40cc84b86ad1","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f789e894-e52b-4bde-afb6-40cc84b86ad1_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35737725","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/33ed7aec-f622-467c-b1d3-d27724f4eab4","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_014482.3(BMP10):c.625C>T (p.Arg209Cys)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA1692145"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Heterozygous"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":0.1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d1da0a68-cf08-4de9-8461-0808826679bd_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d1da0a68-cf08-4de9-8461-0808826679bd_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/258b62a4-3067-4cde-8204-dff922fab1ff","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Downgraded due to the study not closely investigating mutant BMP10 in mice nor capturing the disease inheritance pattern.
