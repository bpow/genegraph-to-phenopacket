Five probands with multi-gene CNVs (4 gross deletions, 1 duplication) at the 10q21.3 location have been reported in four publications (PMIDs: 23481551, 24297458, 28378413, 28472932). Although this gene-disease association is supported by a protein interaction study (PMID:​ 15302915), no reports have directly implicated the gene in humans. In summary, the evidence supporting the relationship between *CTNNA3* and congenital heart disease has been disputed and no valid evidence remains to support the claim. More evidence is needed to either support or entirely refute the role *CTNNA3* plays in this disease.This classification was approved by the ClinGen Congenital Heart Disease GCEP on the meeting date 10/17/2023 (SOP Version 9)","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f927e3f1-3ace-448b-bf76-79fcd84390a9","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d30ce558-9009-45d3-9eb3-9b5c7594d1b8","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"NoKnownDiseaseRelationship","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d30ce558-9009-45d3-9eb3-9b5c7594d1b8_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10130","date":"2023-10-17T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d30ce558-9009-45d3-9eb3-9b5c7594d1b8_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10130","date":"2024-01-03T19:23:06.783Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"Experts deemed evidence not enough to support the gene-diasease relationship","curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d30ce558-9009-45d3-9eb3-9b5c7594d1b8_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d30ce558-9009-45d3-9eb3-9b5c7594d1b8_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d30ce558-9009-45d3-9eb3-9b5c7594d1b8_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b6ae75cc-0bff-4ded-9c90-559fe3ffd7a9","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/da317556-0383-4541-9c29-28c1d7a08926","type":"Finding","dc:description":"GATA-4 is directly involved in regulating αT-catenin expression in cardiac muscle cells.
