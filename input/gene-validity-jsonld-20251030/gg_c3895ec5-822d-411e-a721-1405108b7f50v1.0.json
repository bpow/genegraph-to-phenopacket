Features of autosomal dominant *SPTBN2* related disease include but are not limited to: cerebellar ataxia, nystagmus, developmental delay, and cerebellar atrophy. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting guidelines, we found a difference in the molecular mechanism and inheritance pattern. Therefore, the following disease entities have been split into two disease entities: spinocerebellar ataxia 5 (OMIM:600224), spinocerebellar ataxia recessive 14 (OMIM:615386). The split curation for autosomal recessive *SPTBN2* related spinocerebellar ataxia has been curated separately. 16 variants (14 missense and 2 in-frame indels that have been reported in 18 probands in 9 publications (PMIDs: 16429157, 25981959, 22914369, 31617442, 31066025, 31721007, 30898343, 29915382, 33801522) are included in this curation. Segregation in a large well phenotyped family with extensive genotyping yielded approximately 90 affected with consistent features and all affected members genotyped, carried the familial variant (PMID 16429157). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be gain-of-function, though the precise nature of the altered function is unclear. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by an animal model, expression study and functional alteration assay (PMIDs: 9826670, 20603325, 25057192). Expression of a human patient derived variant nearly fully recapitulated the ataxia and cerebellar atrophy features in a mouse model and a cell-culture model in a mouse neuronal cell line (Neuro2a) showed disruption to sub-cellular localization. Further functional evidence was used to weight case-level evidence and suggested that at least one mechanism for disease could be related to an increase in variant *SPTBN2* binding affinity for actin (PMID: 37626910). In summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *SPTBN2* and autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxia. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Cerebellar Ataxia GCEP on the meeting date Wednesday Sepetember 10, 2025 (SOP Version 11).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c3895ec5-822d-411e-a721-1405108b7f50","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/634f17d6-d189-4141-a57f-998639db0a4f","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/634f17d6-d189-4141-a57f-998639db0a4f_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10155","date":"2025-09-10T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/634f17d6-d189-4141-a57f-998639db0a4f_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10155","date":"2025-09-10T20:21:17.809Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/634f17d6-d189-4141-a57f-998639db0a4f_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/634f17d6-d189-4141-a57f-998639db0a4f_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5e5afbb5-5c9b-4899-9892-d57932742c53","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The model nearly fully recapitulates the ataxia phenotype seen in human variant carriers and this was the result of expression the human gene in mouse purkinje cells only which would be consistent with the phenotype as well.
