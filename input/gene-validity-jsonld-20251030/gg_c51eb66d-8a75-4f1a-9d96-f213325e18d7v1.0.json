The *MT-ND1* gene encodes the NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) core subunit ND1. Defects of this protein lead to complex I deficiency.\n\nThe *MT-ND1* gene was first reported in relation to maternally inherited Leigh syndrome spectrum in 2004 (PMID: 15466014). Evidence supporting the gene-disease relationship between *MT-ND1* and Leigh syndrome spectrum includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included 5 variants in 9 cases (1 with m.3481G>A, 1 with m.3688G>A, 4 with m.3697G>A, 2 with m.3890G>A, and 1 with m.3928G>C) from 8 publications (PMIDs: 15466014, 18504678, 18977334, 23246842, 24063851, 27017994, 24830958, 31996177). Of note, while Gene Curation SOP Version 8 maxes case level missense variant total score at 7, the Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel agreed the maximum score would be 12 given that the majority of pathogenic mitochondrial DNA variants are missense variants (the total score for genetic level evidence in this curation was 12). Segregation information is scored as case level evidence according to the criteria established by the Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel. Loss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease association is also supported by known protein interaction and functional alteration in non-patient cells (PMIDs: 27509854, 22079202, 17535832). \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support this gene-disease relationship, including that more than three years have elapsed from the first proposal of the association. This classification was approved by the NICHD U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on April 14, 2021 (SOP Version 8).\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c51eb66d-8a75-4f1a-9d96-f213325e18d7","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8bb99c59-15c9-4e19-ba8b-df6cb800c32d","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8bb99c59-15c9-4e19-ba8b-df6cb800c32d_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2021-04-14T04:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8bb99c59-15c9-4e19-ba8b-df6cb800c32d_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2022-07-06T18:43:23.906Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8bb99c59-15c9-4e19-ba8b-df6cb800c32d_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8bb99c59-15c9-4e19-ba8b-df6cb800c32d_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f67d77cd-9731-4f58-ba19-821e59fb4911","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"m.3376G > A (p.E24K) variant results in biochemical abnormalities in complex I that might result in disease development.","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7bcb1364-fd36-4528-b7b9-e87c96b9e231","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"The m.3376G > A (p.E24K)and m.3865A > G (p.I187V) transitions in human (LHON/MELAS) correspond to Glu-36 and Ile-201 residues in the homologous NuoH subunit of E. coli (E36K, E36Q, E36D, I201V).\n1. The d-NADH:DB oxidoreductase activity (at 100 μM DB) in membranes from the E36K mutant was almost totally abolished (Table 2) and could not be enhanced by increasing the DB concentration. The d-NADH:O2 activity, which utilizes endogenous UQ, was more severely affected than the d-NADH:UQ reductase activity with short-chained DB, presenting 4% and 13% of control activities, respectively. Also the d-NADH:HAR reductase activity was decreased, suggesting a decrease in the amount of fully assembled NDH-1 in cytoplasmic membranes (Fig 2). The I201V substitution, analogous to human p.I187V, had a small effect on the amount of NDH-1 in the membranes but the activity with DB was bot significantly decreased.\n2.
