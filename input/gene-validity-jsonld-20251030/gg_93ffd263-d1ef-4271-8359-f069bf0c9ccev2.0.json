{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/93ffd263-d1ef-4271-8359-f069bf0c9ccev2.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"ABCC9 was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) in 2004 (Bienengraeber et al., 2003, PMID: 15034580). ABCC9 was originally evaluated for DCM by the ClinGen DCM GCEP on 08/28/20 (SOP Version 7). Evidence of the association of this gene with DCM was re-evaluated using SOP v10 on 11/15/2024. As a result, the classification did not change. A summary of the information contributing to the classification of this gene at the time of re-evaluation is summarized herein. Human genetic evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes only case-level data. At least 2 variants (including 1 missense and 1 frameshift) have been reported in humans with DCM (Bienengraeber et al., 2003, PMID: 15034580). In addition, this gene-disease assertion is supported by animal models (Fahrenbach et al., 2014, PMID: 24648545 and Smeland et al., 2019, PMID: 31575858) and expression studies (Kepenek et al., 2020, PMID: 31948008). In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. More evidence is needed to support the relationship of ABCC9 with autosomal dominant DCM. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Dilated Cardiomyopathy Working Group on 11/15/2024 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/93ffd263-d1ef-4271-8359-f069bf0c9cce","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8be22ebc-f0f5-4de5-9c2a-382ebd02c533","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","changes":[{"id":"cg:sopChange"},{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"},{"id":"cg:summaryChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8be22ebc-f0f5-4de5-9c2a-382ebd02c533_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10035","date":"2024-11-15T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8be22ebc-f0f5-4de5-9c2a-382ebd02c533_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10035","date":"2025-08-19T18:47:38.340Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["RecurationTiming"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8be22ebc-f0f5-4de5-9c2a-382ebd02c533_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/eaff6039-2d59-48f0-a175-7c89fb0614c3","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Functional evidence provided for the missense variant is not an established DCM disease mechanism.","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/eaff6039-2d59-48f0-a175-7c89fb0614c3_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15034580","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9d49fefd-5904-40eb-9dfa-5ddf751538c7","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_020297.3(ABCC9):c.4537G>A (p.Ala1513Thr)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA254332"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:AlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Heterozygous"}},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/eaff6039-2d59-48f0-a175-7c89fb0614c3_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"The C terminus of SUR proteins contributes to KATP channel trafficking 19, 20, and Fs1524 and A1513T SUR2A mutants, reconstituted with Kir6.2, had reduced expression in the plasma membrane (Fig. 2a).
