SDHA was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Leigh syndrome spectrum in 1995 (Bourgeron et al., PMID 7550341). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 7 probands in 6 publications (PMIDs 7550341, 10746566, 16361598, 16798039, 22972948, 24781757). This gene-disease association is supported by the known protein interactions, model systems, and rescue. The mechanism for disease is complex II deficiency. In summary, there is moderate evidence to support the relationship between SDHA and autosomal recessive Leigh syndrome spectrum. This classification was approved by the NICHD U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on May 13, 2019 (SOP Version 6).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/999600ae-86a8-45cd-8d79-69e5a91e213a","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4c5801d0-5839-47d9-81cc-a53cea959b57","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4c5801d0-5839-47d9-81cc-a53cea959b57_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2019-05-20T19:09:35.665Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4c5801d0-5839-47d9-81cc-a53cea959b57_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4c5801d0-5839-47d9-81cc-a53cea959b57_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4c5801d0-5839-47d9-81cc-a53cea959b57_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/af6e5189-9aa1-4aee-895a-f723f79a5dcd","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Fulfills only one aspect of Leigh syndrome spectrum phenotype","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4c1a1161-b1c2-4750-ab2c-064625018460","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Evidence of OXPHOS enzyme activity deficiency (<30%) in affected tissue (muscle, liver)(assessed by spectrophotometric assay) is part of Leigh syndrome spectrum phenotype","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1511876","rdfs:label":"Yeast SDH1 gene disruption","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4e6f7b71-9f56-43c0-85ee-821fcb46c597","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Rescues biochemical defect, which is included in Leigh syndrome spectrum definition","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f804b9ac-62c8-4060-b234-90231c8cacad","type":"Finding","dc:description":"restored ability of the mutant to grow on non-fermentable substrates","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9730279","rdfs:label":"Transformation","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:PhenotypeRescue"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanRescueCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4c5801d0-5839-47d9-81cc-a53cea959b57_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fec73206-eaa0-435b-a85b-f497bccfecf4","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The encoded protein interacts with one gene product (SDHB) whose dysfunction is known to cause Leigh syndrome.","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/521d88fb-b2eb-4452-a79d-6d9a865994e4","type":"Finding","dc:description":"See PMID: 20226277 for overview, PMID: 15989954 for crystal structure","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22972948","rdfs:label":"SDHA and SDHB are complex II subunits","demonstrates":{"id":"obo:MI_0915"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/acdec9da-9555-4b14-85d1-7ff050c36af4","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Experiments do not show SDHAF1 interacts with SDHA directly.","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/91af50f2-0a55-41ed-b2b4-e506b0cf5cf4","type":"Finding","dc:description":"SDHB and SDHA are subunits of Complex II, this manuscript details SDHAF1 as assembly factor for complex II","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19465911","rdfs:label":"disruption of yeast homolog, expression of wt in mutant CL","demonstrates":{"id":"obo:MI_0915"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4c5801d0-5839-47d9-81cc-a53cea959b57_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/73c1d520-87ce-4c62-82f4-018c3bc5dd85_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"minimal functional studies (increased enzyme sensitivity to oxaloacetate (only known physiological inhibitor of enzyme);
