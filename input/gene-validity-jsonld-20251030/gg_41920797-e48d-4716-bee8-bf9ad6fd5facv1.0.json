{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/41920797-e48d-4716-bee8-bf9ad6fd5facv1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"SIL1 was first reported in relation to the autosomal recessive disorder Marinesco-Sjogren syndrome (MSS) in 2005 (Senderek et al, PMID: 16282977; Anttonen et al, PMID: 16282978). MSS is a multisystem disorder that is characterized by cerebellar dysfunction and ataxia, early-onset bilateral cataracts, developmental delays, intellectual disability, skeletal deformities, short stature and progressive myopathy (Anttonen, 2019, PMID: 20301371; Chiesa and Sallese, 2020, PMID: 31701543; Ichhaporia and Hendershot, 2021, PMID: 33557244). MSS is the only disorder known to be caused by variants in SIL1. \n\nSIL1 encodes an adenine nucleotide exchange factor for the ER homologue of Hsp (heat shock protein) 70 family, also known as BiP, HSPA5, or GRP78. Recent reviews discuss the role of SIL1 in the ER, and indicate that lack of SIL1 results in accumulation of unfolded proteins within the ER, providing a pathogenic mechanism for the features of MSS (Chiesa and Sallese, 2020, PMID: 31701543; Ichhaporia and Hendershot, 2021, PMID: 33557244).\n\nOver 40 MSS-associated variants have been reported in SIL1, including nonsense, frameshift, splice site inframe deletions, and missense variants (Ichhaporia and Hendershot, 2021, PMID: 33557244). Of note, about 40% of individuals with characteristic features of MSS do not have identifiable variants in SIL1 (Krieger et al, 2013, PMID: 24176978). Other causes have not yet been identified.\n\nThirteen variants that have been reported in eleven probands in three publications are included in this curation (Senderek et al, 2005, PMID: 16282977; Anttonen et al, 2005, PMID: 16282978; Krieger et al, 2013, PMID: 24176978). In addition, linkage data is included from Finnish families in which affected individuals are homozygous for a founder variant in the Finnish population (Anttonen et al, 2005, PMID: 16282978). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is loss of function.\n\n This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence including a spontaneous mouse model known as the woozy mouse (Zhao et al, 2005, PMID: 16116427; Kayashi et al, 2018, PMID: 28723727) and a knock out mouse model (Zhao et al, 2005, PMID: 16116427) both of which recapitulate the cortical atrophy, ataxia, and myopathy observed in human patients, but which typically do not develop cataracts. In addition, cortical neuron migration defects in mice resulting from Sil1 RNAi knockdown were rescued by human SIL1 (Inaguma et al, 2014, PMID: 24473200). In addition, results from analysis of cells and tissues from individuals with MSS and animal models of MSS is reviewed in detail in PMID: 31701543 (Table 2) and PMID: 33557244.\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between SIL1 and the autosomal recessive disorder Marinesco-Sjogren syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Lysosomal Diseases Gene Curation Expert Panel on December 5, 2023 (SOP Version 10).  \n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/41920797-e48d-4716-bee8-bf9ad6fd5fac","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3511d4dd-48bc-4d93-9b86-16bf46fabc5d","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3511d4dd-48bc-4d93-9b86-16bf46fabc5d_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10110","date":"2023-12-05T20:58:25.144Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3511d4dd-48bc-4d93-9b86-16bf46fabc5d_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10110","date":"2023-12-05T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3511d4dd-48bc-4d93-9b86-16bf46fabc5d_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3511d4dd-48bc-4d93-9b86-16bf46fabc5d_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f4b154d4-6909-4f7c-9d9d-e0a4db1947ab","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cc14e6b7-fb23-44a9-b12e-ae9d2b893d15","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Woozy (wz) mice have a spontaneous variant in Sil1 which leads to a transcript containing exons 1-7 of Sil1 spliced to an ETn retrotransposon, with an in-frame stop codon after 96 nucleotides of ETn sequence (PMID: 16116427).
