A case-control study found lack of enrichment of *RECQL4 *variants in congenital heart disease patients compared to controls. Experimental evidence for this gene was also evaluated. In one mouse model, the homozygous mutant mice were able to survive past birth, yet had high-severity growth delay and anomalies in many regions, skin anomalies, and embryonic fibroblasts with a reduction in cell proliferation. In another mouse model, the homozygous mutants had significant skin anomaly, skeletal congenital complications, genomic instability, and heightened cancer risk. However, neither of these mouse models were scored as none of the mutants had congenital heart disease (PMID: 12915449, 15703196). No evidence for a causal role for *RECQL4* in autosomal dominant congenital heart disease has been reported. However, congenital heart disease is just one symptom associated with autosomal recessive Baller-Gerold Syndrome, for which more *RECQL4* variants have been reported. The relationship between *RECQL4* and Baller-Gerold Syndrome is yet to be evaluated. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Congenital Heart Disease GCEP on the meeting date 2/10/2025 (SOP Version 11).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/270f4fb3-1c41-4756-8a28-aae9a1e0897b","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/542917be-3b90-477b-a427-3f8ee0550dea","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"NoKnownDiseaseRelationship","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/542917be-3b90-477b-a427-3f8ee0550dea_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10130","date":"2025-02-10T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/542917be-3b90-477b-a427-3f8ee0550dea_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10130","date":"2025-03-25T19:33:04.387Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/542917be-3b90-477b-a427-3f8ee0550dea_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/542917be-3b90-477b-a427-3f8ee0550dea_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/542917be-3b90-477b-a427-3f8ee0550dea_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fbf554a5-e29c-45bc-9892-1e685c782627","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The mutant mice do not have congenital heart disease, and thus this model could not be scored.
