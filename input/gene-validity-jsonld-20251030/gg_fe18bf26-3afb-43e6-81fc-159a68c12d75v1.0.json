Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in molecular mechanism, and inheritance pattern, or phenotypic variability for the autosomal dominant predisposition to cancer descriptions. Therefore, a susceptibility to a range of hereditary cancers, including breast, ovarian, colorectal, and pancreatic cancers, have been lumped into one disease entity, ATM-related cancer predisposition (MONDO:0700270). The recessive disorder Ataxia telangiectasia (MONDO:0008840) was split and curated separately due phenotype and inheritance pattern differences. Several case-control studies were used as genetic evidence (PMIDs: 31406321, 29478780, 30733081, 33471974, 33471991), including data from the CARRIERS consortium (PMID: 33471974) and the Breast Cancer Association Consortium (PMID: 3347199). These studies consistently provided strong evidence that individuals with heterozygous loss-of-function ATM variants are at moderately increased risk for the listed associated cancers. This is supported by the observation that tumors from these individuals feature biallelic loss-of-function variants (PMID: 29478780). Additional evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss of function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by animal modeling (PMID:12195425) and in vitro functional assays (PMIDs: 17525332, 9733514, 10492163, 10999741, 11805335, 12195425). The experimental work consistently demonstrates that ATM loss-of-function variants disrupt DNA damage response, especially in response to ionizing radiation. The signaling function of ATM has been closely related to the function of other known cancer predisposition genes from the same pathway, including BRCA1 (PMID: 10550055). In summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between ATM and autosomal dominant ATM-related cancer predisposition. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hereditary Cancer GCEP on the meeting date November 22, 2024 (SOP Version 11).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fe18bf26-3afb-43e6-81fc-159a68c12d75","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5acbaa2d-bdd3-40dd-b7e4-df0b0204468e","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5acbaa2d-bdd3-40dd-b7e4-df0b0204468e_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10023","date":"2024-12-20T16:48:08.096Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5acbaa2d-bdd3-40dd-b7e4-df0b0204468e_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10023","date":"2024-11-22T18:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["RecurationNewEvidence","RecurationCommunityRequest"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5acbaa2d-bdd3-40dd-b7e4-df0b0204468e_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5acbaa2d-bdd3-40dd-b7e4-df0b0204468e_cc_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4318da8a-1718-4f41-b132-7078a1cee198","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4318da8a-1718-4f41-b132-7078a1cee198_cc_evidence_item","type":"Finding","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33471974","rdfs:label":"Hu ATM Case-Control","caseCohort":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fc0f86e1-ef4f-4131-a068-fc6ab325145b","type":"Cohort","allGenotypedSequenced":32247,"alleleFrequency":0.00784569107203771,"detectionMethod":"Sequencing using a custom \nmultigene amplicon-based panel to identify germline pathogenic variants in 28 cancer-predisposition genes.","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4318da8a-1718-4f41-b132-7078a1cee198_cc_evidence_item"}],"numWithVariant":253,"relatedCondition":{"id":"obo:MONDO_0700270"}},"controlCohort":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c8d5c4d7-68c7-4e2f-aac5-da0333094636","type":"Cohort","allGenotypedSequenced":32544,"alleleFrequency":0.004117502458210423,"detectionMethod":"Sequencing using a custom \nmultigene amplicon-based panel to identify germline pathogenic variants in 28 cancer-predisposition genes.","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4318da8a-1718-4f41-b132-7078a1cee198_cc_evidence_item"}],"numWithVariant":134},"lowerConfidenceLimit":1.46,"method":{"id":"cg:AggregateVariantAnalysis"},"pValue":0.001,"statisticalSignificanceType":"","statisticalSignificanceValue":1.82,"statisticalSignificanceValueType":"Odds Ratio","upperConfidenceLimit":2.27}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCaseControlAggregateVariantAnalysisCriteria","strengthScore":4},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/df121bdc-93ee-40d5-9fe1-cb9efc16d6ce","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/df121bdc-93ee-40d5-9fe1-cb9efc16d6ce_cc_evidence_item","type":"Finding","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31406321","rdfs:label":"LaDuca 2020 CRC","caseCohort":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d247c3c6-61b8-470f-b716-3a2a8dcce25a","type":"Cohort","allGenotypedSequenced":3162,"alleleFrequency":0.005376344086021506,"detectionMethod":"Patients underwent comprehensive germline analysis of 5–49 genes depending on the multigene panel ordered (Table S1).

We evaluated radiation-induced death and chromosome aberrations in 7636del9 heterozygous human and Atm-ΔSRI heterozygous mouse cells. In both types of heterozygotes, cell viability was reduced to a level intermediate between those of the normal control and the corresponding homozygote after exposure to radiation (Fig. 3a,b). In addition, the number of radiation-induced chromosome aberrations (ICA) per metaphase was 2.4 and 2.5 in human and mouse ΔSRI heterozygotes respectively, again intermediate between the values for normal controls (1.1 (human) and 1.25 (mouse) ICA per metaphase) and homozygotes (3.2 (human) and 3.7 (mouse) ICA per metaphase). We also determined Atm kinase activity in irradiated cells using the induction of Ser18 phosphorylation on p53 as an indicator of activity. Ser18 phosphorylation occurred more slowly in Atm-ΔSRI homozygotes than in controls, but the degree of discrimination was not enough to distinguish Atm-ΔSRI heterozygotes from the other two groups (Fig. 3c). This was also the case for radiation-induced phosphorylation of p53 Ser15 in two ataxia-telangiectasia carriers, ATH1ABR and ATH2ABR (results not shown).\"\n\n& \n\n\"In the case of C3ABR cells transfected with pMAT1 (carrying full-length ATM cDNA), the two fragments arise from both endogenous and induced ATM wildtype cDNA and are indistinguishable (Fig. 4d). Expression of both mutant (pΔSRI) and wildtype ATM (pMAT1) was confirmed only in CdCl2-induced cells by immunoblotting with an antibody that detected the FLAG-tagged recombinant ATM mutant protein (Fig. 4a). The faint band in the uninduced lanes is non-specific, as it is also observed in extracts from non-transfected parental cells (Fig. 4a). Under these conditions, the ΔSRI mutant ATM abolished radiation-induced ATM kinase activity, as measured by immunoprecipitation in vitro, whereas the normal full-length ATM cDNA did not interfere with activity (Fig. 4b). This dominant interference was also evident when ATM kinase activity was measured in vivo by Ser15 phosphorylation on p53 (Fig. 4c). \"","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12195425","rdfs:label":"Function in patients cells and activity in transfected LBLs"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5acbaa2d-bdd3-40dd-b7e4-df0b0204468e_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/18bce02b-f141-450f-9b2c-880f1d08a3af","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6715c8a4-1f1f-4fde-8248-406f702caf84","type":"Finding","dc:description":"The loss of a competent DNA damage response after a radiation insult leading to overgrowth.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11805335","rdfs:label":"ATM mutant in LBL disrupt radiation response","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a63b8f92-af74-4fd5-a594-5fae039607a2","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7791fa7f-7a1a-4e0d-b367-5bb30c16cdf0","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Defective DDR contributes to somatic mutagenesis and thus carcinogenesis.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17525332","rdfs:label":"Proteomic Analysis Implicates ATM and ATR in DDR","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/95dfc38b-0371-469b-9824-449cd132a864","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5f7a79c3-60ab-4933-8c6b-f1ef1e5266bc","type":"Finding","dc:description":"The paper shows that ATM signaling is important to DNA damage response and is sensitive to disruption by mutation.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9733514","rdfs:label":"In Vitro Study of ATM Kinase Signaling in DDR Pathway","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d401cf0b-cb4e-48bf-8a1a-c9cdba1374e0","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9555bf12-883c-4dcf-badd-47f6ba32d046","type":"Finding","dc:description":"\"In the course of identifying Brcal-associated proteins by mass spectrometry, we identified\nATM and confirmed this association by reciprocal coimmunoprecipitation (Fig. 1A)\"","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10550055","rdfs:label":"ATM required for BRCA1 phosphorylation","demonstrates":{"id":"obo:MI_0915"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c7a52771-80a7-47ee-aa22-a0bcaa840443","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/edb028a7-df4d-4200-98a6-bb9b8f4fe222","type":"Finding","dc:description":"\"ATM protein expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry in 17 breast carcinomas with two monoclonal antibodies whose immunohistochemical use was first validated by comparing the immunoreactivity observed in spleen samples from ataxia telangiectasia and trauma patients.
