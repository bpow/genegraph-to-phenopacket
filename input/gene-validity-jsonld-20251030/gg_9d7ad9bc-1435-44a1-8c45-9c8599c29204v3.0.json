{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9d7ad9bc-1435-44a1-8c45-9c8599c29204v3.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"The relationship between *VKORC1* and combined deficiency of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, type 2 (VKCFD2), an autosomal recessive disorder, was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of July, 2025. *VKORC1* encodes the catalytic subunit of the vitamin K epoxide reductase complex, which is involved in the reduction of inactive vitamin K 2,3-epoxide to active vitamin K (RefSeq, Aug 2015). Patients with VKCFD2 present with severe bleeding manifestations and absent or reduced activity of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors.  The condition, VKCFD, type 1 is caused by mutations in the GGCX gene.\n\n*VKORC1* was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive VKCFD2 in 2004 (Rost et al, PMID: 14765194). Only one missense variant has been reported in this gene in relation to VKCFD2. While several polymorphisms in *VKORC1* have been reported in association with variability in response to vitamin K antagonists (VKA), this does not constitute a clinical disease entity. These variants have not been included in this curation. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. \n   \nSummary of Case Level Data (3 points):\nAt least 3 patients from 3 families in 5 publications have been reported with the same homozygous missense variant, Arg98Trp, which is considered a mutational hotspot (PMID: 12704386). The variant segregated in 5 additional family members. The mechanism is expected to be biallelic loss of function. \n  \nSummary of experimental data (3.5 points):\nThis gene-disease association is supported by a knock-out mouse model that recapitulates the bleeding phenotype seen in human patients, however, it is more severe and lethal (PMID: 19492146). *VKORC1* function is not completely understood, but it localizes to the ER and its mislocalization due to the Arg98Trp variant is reported to be the mechanism of disease in VKCFD2 (PMID: 14765194, 24963046). Wild-type *VKORC1* restores VKOR activity in cell culture (PMID: 14765194).\n  \nIn summary, the level of evidence to support the gene-disease relationship of *VKORC1* and autosomal recessive combined deficiency of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, type 2, is moderate. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged.\n\nThis gene-disease pair was originally approved by the HT GCEP on 06/24/2020. It was reevaluated on 04/03/2023 and 07/29/2025. As a result of these reevaluations no new evidence was identified and the classification remained at Moderate (SOP Version 11).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9d7ad9bc-1435-44a1-8c45-9c8599c29204","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/84145ffe-9835-4a3a-a2ae-6d0c6bd34007","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","changes":[{"id":"cg:sopChange"},{"id":"cg:summaryChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/84145ffe-9835-4a3a-a2ae-6d0c6bd34007_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2025-09-03T12:40:45.191Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/84145ffe-9835-4a3a-a2ae-6d0c6bd34007_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2025-09-03T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["RecurationTiming"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/84145ffe-9835-4a3a-a2ae-6d0c6bd34007_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6e9d2a07-3e5f-45c2-9bdd-953a151401f2_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6e9d2a07-3e5f-45c2-9bdd-953a151401f2","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14765194","rdfs:label":"Rost_Family B - Proband (B3)","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/478f05a7-1f4f-41f1-b14c-0636e69e0602","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_024006.6(VKORC1):c.292C>T (p.Arg98Trp)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA115411"}},"detectionMethod":"All 3 exons and exon-intron boundaries were amplified by PCR and directly sequenced.","firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001510","obo:HP_0012541","obo:HP_0011858","obo:HP_0005543","obo:HP_0008151","obo:HP_0008169","obo:HP_0002313","obo:HP_0001342","obo:HP_0008321","obo:HP_0001256","obo:HP_0000238","obo:HP_0001250"],"previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"All 15 exons and flanking regions of the GGCX gene were amplified and sequenced, no mutations were detected.
