Parkinson´s disease is a progressive degenerative disorder of the central nervous system characterized by loss of dopamine-producing neurons in the substantia nigra. Signs and symptoms include tremor, which is most pronounced during rest, muscle rigidity, slowing of voluntary movements (bradykinesia), and a tendency to fall back (postural instability). Many PRKN pathogenic variants in the biallelic state have been reported in >1000 patients by different authors/groups from different ethnicities (Kasten et al. 2018, PMID: 29644727, www.mdsgene.org). The mutational spectrum is broad, often including structural variants (e.g. exon deletions), nonsense, frameshift, splice site, and missense changes. Four multiplex families from three publications are included in this curation, covering patients with biallelic truncating variants. The additional evidence from the literature was not included in this curation because the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The disease follows a recessive mode of inheritance with almost full, but age-dependent penetrance (Deng et al. 2006, PMID: 16476817; Qin et al. 2014, PMID: 25404955; www.medgene.org). Notably, there is an ongoing debate on the potential role of heterozygous variants as genetic risk factors for Parkinson´s disease (Klein et al. 2007, PMID: 17582365; Zhu et al. 2022, PMID: 35640906). The gene-disease association is also supported by recurrent experimental evidence, including animal models and in-vitro functional assays. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be a loss-of-function (LOF) indicated by the many truncating variants and further supported by knock-out fly models (Greene et al., PMID: 12642658). There is a well-defined functional interaction with another autosomal-recessive Parkinson´s disease-linked gene, i.e. PINK1. While PINK1 functions as a sensor for disrupted mitochondria, the PRKN-encoded Parkin protein as an E3-ubiquitin ligase is involved in labeling such mitochondria for degradation (Narendra et al. 2010, PMID: 20126261; Rakovic et al. 2010, PMID: 20508036). It has further repeatedly been shown that several of the PRKN missense variants have impaired ubiquitination properties and impair proper mitophagy (e.g. Sriram et al. 2005, PMID: 16049031; Hampe et al. 2006, PMID: 16714300; Lee et al. 2010; PMID: 20457763; Chaugule et al. 2011, PMID: 21694720; Yi et al. 2019, PMID: 30994895). PRKN overexpression was shown to rescue the phenotype in PINK1 mutant flies (Park et al. 2006, PMID: 16672980). In summary, biallelic, pathogenic variants in PRKN are definitively causing autosomal-recessive Parkinson´s disease. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/656cee01-34a0-4124-a800-5243cedce6c0","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6b39c4a0-f6bd-4afc-b2a7-f234eab5a667","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6b39c4a0-f6bd-4afc-b2a7-f234eab5a667_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10079","date":"2023-01-18T19:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6b39c4a0-f6bd-4afc-b2a7-f234eab5a667_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10079","date":"2023-01-18T21:11:30.105Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6b39c4a0-f6bd-4afc-b2a7-f234eab5a667_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f84c0906-9e94-44af-8ac9-aab675127b71_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/900bc1dd-876c-4901-b856-be7598d9bc2a","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":4,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/900bc1dd-876c-4901-b856-be7598d9bc2a_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"smaller transcript","functionalDataSupport":"Yes"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/900bc1dd-876c-4901-b856-be7598d9bc2a_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9560156","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/74caa4f6-db5a-4555-bb92-bb2199bece6e","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_004562.2(PRKN):c.413-?_534+?del","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/7035"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":4},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f84c0906-9e94-44af-8ac9-aab675127b71","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9560156","rdfs:label":"II:1","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/74caa4f6-db5a-4555-bb92-bb2199bece6e"},"firstTestingMethod":"Other","previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"Linkage","secondTestingMethod":"PCR","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/900bc1dd-876c-4901-b856-be7598d9bc2a_variant_evidence_item"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria","strengthScore":3},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9b8a5e74-785d-47e2-99de-5e0a4190c958_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/18f23a80-9b3a-46b5-9674-677a8ee6470f","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":3.0,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/18f23a80-9b3a-46b5-9674-677a8ee6470f_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11402119","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1d40179b-857b-4aa7-badb-5938ef72ab59","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_004562.3(PRKN):c.101del (p.Gln34ArgfsTer10)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA4090513"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":3.0},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9b8a5e74-785d-47e2-99de-5e0a4190c958","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11402119","rdfs:label":"1","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1d40179b-857b-4aa7-badb-5938ef72ab59"},"detectionMethod":"All exons of the parkin gene were screened for\ndeletions, insertions, or point mutations by direct sequenc-\ning of the PCR products that were sequenced on both\nstrands with a BigDye terminator cycle sequencing kit on\nan ABI310 sequencer (Perkin-Elmer).\nRestriction analysis for mutation of exon 2.

Mutations in PINK1 and Parkin Disrupt PINK1/Parkin Pathway at Distinct Steps\nAs was reported previously, wild-type YFP-Parkin is recruited to mitochondria in the majority of HeLa cells (94.7±5.8%) by confocal microscopy, following treatment with 10 µM CCCP for 1 h (Figure 9A and 9B). Pathogenic mutations in the UBL domain (R42P and R46P), deletion of the UBL, or mutation of a key residue (I44A) in the interaction of UBLs with UBDs [47], all cause a moderate deficit in Parkin recruitment to depolarized mitochondria (34±5.3% and 26.5±6.6% for R42P and R46P, respectively) (Figure 9A and 9B and Figure S7A–S7E). Mutations in conserved cysteines of the RING domains (the patient mutations C253Y, C289G, and C441R and the engineered mutation C332S) completely disrupt recruitment at 1 h of CCCP treatment, as do mutations (patient mutation Q311X and engineered mutation T415X) that result in loss of RING2 (Figure 9A and 9B). Mutations K211N and C212Y, which lie within a highly conserved region of Parkin that is likely a novel RING-like domain [41] (Figure S5A), similarly blocked the recruitment of Parkin to mitochondria (Figure 9B), consistent with the importance of this region for Parkin's activity. Mitochondrial recruitment was seen for several of the conserved cysteine RING mutants (C289G, C332S, and C441R) after 24 h of CCCP exposure, suggesting that recruitment is not completely disrupted with these mutations (Figure S8A and S8B). Interestingly, the R275W mutation in RING1 exhibited only a mild deficit in recruitment (81.7±2.1%) (Figure 9A and 9B). The recruitment of YFP-Parkin R275W was verified in a live-cell imaging experiment (Figure S8C).
