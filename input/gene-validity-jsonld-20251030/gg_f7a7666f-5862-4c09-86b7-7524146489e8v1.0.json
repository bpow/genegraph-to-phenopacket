Features include hypertelorism, deficiencies of the eyelids and facial bones, cleft palate/velopharyngeal insufficiency, and low-set cupped ears (PMID: 28369379). Three unique missense variants, all occurring de novo at the Glu117 codon, have been reported in patients (PMIDs: 28369379, 30450715). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level and experimental evidence. Of note, TWIST1 has also been assessed in association with Saethre-Chotzen syndrome and reached a definitive classification. Indicating it is an ultra-rare condition, only 3 cases of Sweeney-Cox syndrome have been published to date; therefore, there is limited but suggestive evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Craniofacial malformation expert panel on 3/25/2021.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f7a7666f-5862-4c09-86b7-7524146489e8","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/14ba10ad-ebb5-491f-b4d6-639890ab7ab9","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/14ba10ad-ebb5-491f-b4d6-639890ab7ab9_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10059","date":"2021-03-26T21:32:22.762Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/14ba10ad-ebb5-491f-b4d6-639890ab7ab9_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10059","date":"2021-04-29T15:43:34.245Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/14ba10ad-ebb5-491f-b4d6-639890ab7ab9_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/14ba10ad-ebb5-491f-b4d6-639890ab7ab9_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/98134171-a35a-476b-a949-1580a87262d8","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Evidence was used to upgrade case-level data.

Overall, these phenotypes indicated that Glu29Gly, Glu29Ala and Glu29Gln were the weakest alleles for transcriptional activation as they retained the ability to activate tissue-specific transcription of arg-1 (only in the HMC and enteric muscles) and to a much lesser extent Glu29Gly and Glu29Gln were able to activate expression of egl-15. \n \nArg28Trp [representing SCS allees] animals could express egl-15::gfp indicating that these mutants are less severe than all the Glu29† mutants.
