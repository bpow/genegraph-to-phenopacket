Hypochondroplasia (HCH) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by short-limbed dwarfism, lumbar lordosis, short and broad bones, and caudad narrowing of the interpediculate distance of the lumbar spine. It shows some resemblance to achondroplasia, but is much milder and can be distinguished on clinical and radiographic grounds (Walker et al., PMID: 5564166). Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found differences in phenotypic variability. Therefore, the following disease entities have been split into multiple disease entities, SADDAN (OMIM:616482), Hypochondroplasia (OMIM:146000), Achondroplasia (OMIM: 100800), *FGFR3*-related Thanatophoric Dysplasia (Type I OMIM:187600 and Type II OMIM:187601), Crouzon Syndrome with acanthosis nigricans (OMIM:612247), Muenke Syndrome (OMIM:602849), and CATSHL Syndrome (OMIM:610474). The split curations for these gene disease relationships have been curated separately. Eleven variants (missense) that have been reported in fifteen probands in nine publications (PMIDs: 7670477, 8589686, 10777366, 11015576, 16912704, 27507911, 28181399, 29026271, 36859260) are included in this curation. The mechanism of pathogenicity is known to be gain of function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by a mouse model recapitulating the mechanism of disease and phenocopying certain disease traits observed in human patients (PMIDs: 37345656). In summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *FGFR3* and autosomal dominant hypochondroplasia. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Skeletal Disorders GCEP on the meeting date October 4, 2021 (SOP Version 9).","*FGFR3* was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant hypochondroplasia in 1995 (Bellus et al., PMID: 7670477).

Similarly, the spine was severely affected, with abnormalities of the IVD visible from birth and throughout adulthood. Unexpectedly, analysis of osteogenesis in adult Fgfr3Asn534Lys/+ mice demonstrated opposing effects of the p.Asn534Lys mutation in the trabecular and cortical compartments of long bones. As observed previously in juvenile ACH and TD mice, the HCH gain-of-function mutation resulted in decreased trabecular bone mineral density (BMD) in tibiae, femurs, and vertebral bodies. However, in contrast, increased tibial and femoral cortical BMD in adult Fgfr3Asn534Lys/+ mice was observed, demonstrating that long bones were brittle with reduced toughness. Consistent with this, transcriptional profiling of the femoral cortical bone demonstrated a downregulation of markers of the osteoblast lineage and high-resolution micro–computed tomographic (μCT) analyses of cortical bone highlighted anomalies of the osteocyte lacunae in the Fgfr3Asn534Lys/+ mouse model of HCH. Altogether, these findings indicate that the N534K mutation leads to aberrant regulation of mature osteoblasts and osteocytes in trabecular and cortical bone. The mouse also presents with macrocephaly and prognathism.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37345656","rdfs:label":"Hypochondroplasia Mouse
