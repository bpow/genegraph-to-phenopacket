{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/87e95e74-132e-4f82-b7e0-f7a5c42a8cc1v1.1","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"CHRNB2 was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant sleep-related hypermotor epilepsy in 2000 (De Fusco et\nal., PMID: 11062464). This disorder was previously referred to as nocturnal frontal lobe epilpeys. It is characterized by hypermotor seizures that occur most often in sleep and are occassionally associated with intellectual disability or psychiatric disorders. \n\nAt least 8 missense variants that have been reported in 12 probands in 10 publications (PMIDs: 27054081, 33391346, 35177946, 21497487, 18534914, 18456869, 17900292, 15964197, 11104662, 11062464) are included in this curation. \nThe mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be gain-of-function. \n\nThis gene-disease association is also supported by experimental evidence, including spontaneous seizures during sleep in a rat model and a mouse model, as well as protein-protein interactions with CHRNA4 to form  functional nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) channels (PMIDs: 26091610, 19153075, 12944511).\n \nIn summary, there is a definitive relationship between CHRNB2 and autosomal dominant sleep-related hypermotor epilepsy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.\n\nThis classification was approved by the ClinGen Epilepsy Gene Curation Expert Panel on February 7th, 2023. As of May 5th, 2023, this record underwent administrative updates in which the disease term in the evidence summary was revised to align with the updated Mondo disease term. No new evidence has been reviewed or added.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/87e95e74-132e-4f82-b7e0-f7a5c42a8cc1","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ed365ac2-8cfa-4ae9-8fef-323dd596a22f","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ed365ac2-8cfa-4ae9-8fef-323dd596a22f_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10005","date":"2023-05-03T18:33:25.544Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ed365ac2-8cfa-4ae9-8fef-323dd596a22f_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10005","date":"2023-02-07T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ed365ac2-8cfa-4ae9-8fef-323dd596a22f_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ed365ac2-8cfa-4ae9-8fef-323dd596a22f_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4f714b5e-8232-417f-938a-fb9c869e90f9","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Standard policy for epilepsy gene curations not to use expression data in CNS unless it's very specfic","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Inconclusive","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0296f2c5-81f0-421d-80ed-17d7fdeac769","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Immunoprecipitation from rat nervous system (cortex, hippocampus, striatum).","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15649582","rdfs:label":"Immunoprecipitation from brain tissue","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3001ccee-b206-406c-97ff-0651afb106de","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/07a452cd-6283-4cfe-9881-6f290b19d19c","type":"Finding","dc:description":"CHRNA4 and CHRNB2 encode subunits of nicotinic cholinergic receptors (nAChRs).
