The main phenotypic features include intellectual disability, speech problems, autism spectrum disorder, hypotonia, structural brain abnormalities, seizures, dysmorphic features, skeletal anomalies, delayed growth, and macrocephaly. Seven *de novo* variants (six missense and one inframe) reported in 13 individuals are included in this curation (PMIDs: 30500825, 30761613, 33875846, 35846790). All the variants are located in the GTP/GDP-binding region of RALA. Two variants are recurrent, p.Val25Met and p.Lys128Arg. Functional studies showed that four missense variants exhibited loss of function, while two resulted in gain of function (PMIDs: 30500825, 35846790). One of the missense variants leading to gain of function is a brain somatic variant identified in a child with epilepsy and focal cortical dysplasia type II (PMID: 35846790). \n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence. Biallelic loss-of-function variants in *RALGAPA1*, encoding the catalytic subunit of the RalGAP complex that regulates RALA activity, cause a neurodevelopmental disorder with features overlapping those caused by *RALA* variants and lead to a constitutive activation of RALA in patient cells (PMID: 32004447). Additionally, *in utero* electroporation of the *RALA* c.G482A somatic variant (identified in an individual with focal cortical dysplasia) in the embryonic mouse brain induced abnormal cortical neuron migration (PMID: 35846790).\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *RALA* and autosomal dominant complex neurodevelopmental disorder. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel on July 3, 2024 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3f8458c7-1dff-45ab-821c-08679059aa00","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3ead7886-1be4-404c-977c-0f352a6906f9","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3ead7886-1be4-404c-977c-0f352a6906f9_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2024-07-03T19:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3ead7886-1be4-404c-977c-0f352a6906f9_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2024-11-05T03:03:06.576Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3ead7886-1be4-404c-977c-0f352a6906f9_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d302c0c4-f177-4baa-8c45-f6f7d05bc010","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d302c0c4-f177-4baa-8c45-f6f7d05bc010_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"Recombinant Asp130Gly RALA protein exhibited significantly decreased GTPase activity and RALA effector-protein binding compared to wild-type, indicating loss-of-function.","functionalDataSupport":"Yes"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d302c0c4-f177-4baa-8c45-f6f7d05bc010_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30500825","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fa59b018-1ffc-427b-bab4-73d83a1c738a","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_005402.4(RALA):c.389A>G (p.Asp130Gly)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA367306289"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:DeNovoAlleleOrigin"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:Heterozygous"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b522916d-8f2b-48a8-8e4e-a039bf4ad9b8","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The patient was also found to have a 1.349 Mb duplication at chromosome 1q21.1-q21.2, paternally inherited.
