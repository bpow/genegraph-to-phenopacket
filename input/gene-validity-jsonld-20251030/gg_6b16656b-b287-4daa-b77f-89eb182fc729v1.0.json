Individuals with variants in *BPTF* are reported to present with a phenotypic spectrum including developmental delay/intellectual disability, speech/language delay, motor delay, hypotonia, microcephaly, dysmorphic features, and variable distal limb anomalies including fifth digit clinodactyly and sandal gap. \n\n*BPTF* has been noted to be associated with the following disease entities: neurodevelopmental disorder with dysmorphic facies and distal limb anomalies (OMIM:617755), and non-specific syndromic intellectual disability (ORPHA:528084). Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in molecular mechanism, inheritance pattern, and phenotypic variability. Therefore, the above disease entities have been lumped into one disease entity, syndromic intellectual disability (MONDO:0000508), given that this term captures the neurodevelopmental and syndromic findings reported in the literature to date.\n\nEvidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Seven variants (e.g., frameshift, nonsense, missense) reported in 8 probands (PMIDs: 28942966, 33522091) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss of function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by both non-mammalian and mammalian model systems (PMIDs: 28942966, 35604347).\n \nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between *BPTF* and autosomal dominant syndromic intellectual disability. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the Intellectual Disability and Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel on 7/6/2022 (SOP Version 9).\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6b16656b-b287-4daa-b77f-89eb182fc729","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/08521bf8-a5a2-4a44-941b-12d9eae7aa4f","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/08521bf8-a5a2-4a44-941b-12d9eae7aa4f_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2022-07-19T20:25:24.659Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/08521bf8-a5a2-4a44-941b-12d9eae7aa4f_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2022-07-06T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/08521bf8-a5a2-4a44-941b-12d9eae7aa4f_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/08521bf8-a5a2-4a44-941b-12d9eae7aa4f_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/70de043b-ebeb-4ae8-bf72-399ddbfd46a7","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Downgrading from default for non-mammalian model system.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2199aa8b-f97d-4db1-a01b-20358acef54c","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Zebrafish with disrupted BPTF present with reduced head size and abnormal craniofacial patterning, which resembles microcephaly and dysmorphic facies reported in probands with variants in BPTF.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28942966","rdfs:label":"CRISPR/CAS9 BPTF Loss of Function Zebrafish Model","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8580e3db-e4c5-436e-8da8-2fadff352dbb","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"While the authors examined heterozygous and knockout mice, findings related to reduced forebrain size, abnormal head morphology, and differences in expression were reported to be abnormal in knockout mice.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/44658dc5-3355-43f0-8921-4939f20cffb6","type":"Finding","dc:description":"BPTF knockout mice displayed reduced forebrain size and abnormal head morphology, resembling the phenotypes of microcephaly and dysmorphic facies reported in individuals with variants in BPTF.
