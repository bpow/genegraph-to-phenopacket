{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/13b64577-29fd-4554-854b-5274dcf6a9cev1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"*CYB5A* was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive methemoglobinemia 4 by Giordano et al. in 1994 (PMID: 8168836) in a family that had previously been reported in 1986 (Hegesh et al., PMID: 3951505). Methemoglobinemia 4, also referred to as methemoglobinemia and ambiguous genitalia (MIM#250790) or pure isolated 17,20-lyase deficiency, is characterized by mildly elevated serum methemoglobin, cyanosis, and 46,XY disorder of sexual differentiation (DSD). The cytochrome b5 protein encoded by *CYB5A* interacts with cytochrome P450 17A1 and stimulates 17,20-lyase activity, which is required for the synthesis of androgen hormones. Biallelic loss of *CYB5A* expression or disruption of this interaction leads to 46,XY DSD. To date, only one 46,XX proband with biallelic variants in *CYB5A* has been reported. This individual showed no evidence of DSD or other symptoms beyond elevated serum methemoglobin and cyanosis (PMID: 32051920). \n\nSix variants (missense, in-frame indel, nonsense, canonical splice acceptor site) that have been reported in five probands in five publications (PMIDs: 8168836, 20080843, 22170710, 32051920, 33626548) are included in this curation. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss of function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by animal models, expression studies, *in vitro* functional assays of wild-type function, and demonstrated protein-protein interactions with P450 17A1 (PMIDs: 20430864, 25613900, 26974035, 33753170, 34610701, 36441026). \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *CYB5A* and autosomal recessive methemoglobinemia 4. This association been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen General Inborn Errors of Metabolism GCEP on November 8, 2024 (SOP Version 11).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/13b64577-29fd-4554-854b-5274dcf6a9ce","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/895f7f88-9dcc-42fd-8773-e20dadb6756c","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/895f7f88-9dcc-42fd-8773-e20dadb6756c_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10097","date":"2024-12-13T23:25:59.291Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/895f7f88-9dcc-42fd-8773-e20dadb6756c_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10097","date":"2024-12-13T19:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/895f7f88-9dcc-42fd-8773-e20dadb6756c_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c806747b-b112-4c5e-b6c0-6e7d3f39389a_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/75ba02d1-7f3d-48ad-8f99-38ba88a0746d","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":3.0,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/75ba02d1-7f3d-48ad-8f99-38ba88a0746d_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32051920","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2bf3e447-194f-470b-add1-f0a34b0716b8","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_148923.4(CYB5A):c.105C>G (p.Tyr35Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA8998515"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":3.0},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c806747b-b112-4c5e-b6c0-6e7d3f39389a","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32051920","rdfs:label":"Leung 2019","ageType":"AgeAtDiagnosis","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":24,"allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2bf3e447-194f-470b-add1-f0a34b0716b8"},"detectionMethod":"All exons and exon/intron boundaries sequenced","firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0012119","obo:HP_0000961","obo:HP_0031074"],"previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"CYB5R3","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/75ba02d1-7f3d-48ad-8f99-38ba88a0746d_variant_evidence_item"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria","strengthScore":3.0},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/895f7f88-9dcc-42fd-8773-e20dadb6756c_seg_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/13d897b2-a43f-464b-afb2-32f455fc2b9a_proband_segregation","type":"FamilyCosegregation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22170710","rdfs:label":"Idkowiak 2012 -
