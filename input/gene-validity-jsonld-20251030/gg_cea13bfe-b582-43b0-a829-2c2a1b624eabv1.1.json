H4C5 was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant Tessadori-Bicknell-van Haaften neurodevelopmental syndrome 3 (TEVANED3) in 2022 (Tessadori et al., PMID: 35202563). TEVANED3 is characterized by intellectual disability/global developmental delay, hypotonia, seizure, microcephaly and short stature. To date, 7 missense variants, including 4 unique and 3 recurrent variants in 18 probands have been reported in two publications and are included in this curation (PMID 35202563; 36987712). Experimental evidence to support this gene-disease relationship association is  from expression and protein interaction data at present. In summary, there is strong evidence to support the relationship between H4C5 and autosomal dominant TEVANED3. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Syndromic Disorders GCEP on the meeting date March 19, 2024 (SOP Version 10.0).\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cea13bfe-b582-43b0-a829-2c2a1b624eab","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/934ff2db-b242-49d8-968f-08f8eb7b1310","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Strong","changes":{"id":"cg:sopChange"},"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/934ff2db-b242-49d8-968f-08f8eb7b1310_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10060","date":"2024-09-26T14:23:08.645Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/934ff2db-b242-49d8-968f-08f8eb7b1310_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10060","date":"2024-03-19T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/934ff2db-b242-49d8-968f-08f8eb7b1310_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/86b6d094-359b-412b-8308-0506135c6f6b","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Did not score functional data as it is not statistically significant","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/86b6d094-359b-412b-8308-0506135c6f6b_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35202563","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/830b25a1-0937-461d-ab38-7cfbe82dd73b","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_003545.4(H4C5):c.121C>T (p.Arg41Cys)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA363200670"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:DeNovoAlleleOrigin"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:Heterozygous"}},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/86b6d094-359b-412b-8308-0506135c6f6b_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"Functional consequences of this variant was evaluated in zebrafish embryos via mRNA microinjection.
