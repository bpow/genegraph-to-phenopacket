A DECR-deficient mouse has been generated, which is indistinguishable from wild type mice under standard conditions but under fasting conditions, the Decr-/- mice exhibited symptoms of inborn errors of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation (PMID: 19578400). The phenotypes observed in the homozygous Decr1 knockout mice supports the possibility that a clinical phenotype in humans may only occur in individuals experiencing acute metabolic stress. However, the only severe form of DECR deficiency has reported in \na patient with a homozygous nonsense variant identified in the NADK2 gene (Houten et al., 2014) . No convincing evidence for a causal role for DECR1 in DECR deficiency has been reported. \n\nThis gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the FAO GCEP on 09/25/2018.
