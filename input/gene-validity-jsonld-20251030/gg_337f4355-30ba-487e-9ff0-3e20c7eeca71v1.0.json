{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/337f4355-30ba-487e-9ff0-3e20c7eeca71v1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"The relationship between SLC25A4 and Leigh syndrome spectrum was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of March 24, 2021. The SLC25A4 gene encodes the mitochondrial adenine nucleotide translocator located in the mitochondrial inner membrane and functions to move ADP across the inner membrane into the mitochondrial matrix and ATP from the matrix into the cytoplasm.\n\nThe SLC25A4 gene has been reported only once in relation to autosomal dominant Leigh syndrome spectrum, in 2019 (PMID: 31271879).  However, defects of this gene are also associated with other mitochondrial phenotypes outside the scope of the Leigh syndrome spectrum gene-disease curation, including autosomal dominant progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO) with or without additional features such as exercise intolerance, muscle weakness, and hearing loss; a severe autosomal dominant presentation caused by de novo variants in this gene and characterized by infantile onset encephalomyopathy; and autosomal recessive skeletal myopathy and cardiomyopathy.  Evidence supporting the relationship between SLC25A4 and Leigh syndrome spectrum includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included one de novo variant identified in one case in one publication (PMID: 31271879). No segregation data were available. The exact mechanism of disease is uncertain. This gene-disease association is also supported by known biochemical function, expression, functional alteration in patient cells, and animal models (PMIDs: 27977873, 25613900, 27693233).\n\nIn summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on March 24, 2021 (SOP Version 7).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/337f4355-30ba-487e-9ff0-3e20c7eeca71","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0a6890a4-e2d5-4895-956d-3f3103ec6a2b","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0a6890a4-e2d5-4895-956d-3f3103ec6a2b_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2021-06-14T15:17:48.065Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0a6890a4-e2d5-4895-956d-3f3103ec6a2b_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2021-06-14T15:17:38.675Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0a6890a4-e2d5-4895-956d-3f3103ec6a2b_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0a6890a4-e2d5-4895-956d-3f3103ec6a2b_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ac53147c-62f6-4d51-b02c-54bf318de1c8","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"abnormal mito transport in bacterium studies","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c9bf77ae-0339-49be-bda3-8a1bf02a2da0","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Both the p.Arg80His and p.Arg235Gly alterations had severe effects on transport activity with residual transport rates of 24% and 3%, respectively (Figure 4B).","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27693233","rdfs:label":"Lactococcus lactis Transport activity","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f5468c50-fb81-4808-b093-c6e6a4bef454","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Reduced points as model system was yeast.
