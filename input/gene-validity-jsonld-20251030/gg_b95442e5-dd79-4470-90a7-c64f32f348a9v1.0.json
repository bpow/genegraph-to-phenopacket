{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b95442e5-dd79-4470-90a7-c64f32f348a9v1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"CARD11 (i.e., CARMA1) was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant immunodeficiency 11B with atopic dermatitis in 2017 (Ma CA et al., PMID: 28628108). This is a typically early-onset and heterogeneous disease characterized by atopic dermatitis, recurrent respiratory tract infections, asthma, food allergies, variable decreases in antibody levels, elevated serum IgE levels, and eosinophilia. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found differences in the molecular mechanisms, inheritance patterns, and phenotypic variability for the diseases associated with CARD11. Therefore, the following disease entities have been split into multiple disease entities: autosomal recessive immunodeficiency 11A (i.e., severe combined immunodeficiency due to CARD11 deficiency; OMIM: 615206), autosomal dominant immunodeficiency 11B with atopic dermatitis (OMIM: 617638), and autosomal dominant B-cell expansion with NFkB and T-cell anergy (BENTA; OMIM: 616452). The split curations for immunodeficiency 11A and BENTA have been curated separately. Twenty-one variants (missense, canonical splice site, and nonsense) that have been reported in 21 probands in 4 publications (PMIDs: 28628108, 28826773, 30170123, 33202260) are included in this curation. In addition, CARD11 variants segregated with disease in multiple families (PMID: 28628108, 28826773, 30170123). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is reported to be dominant negative. This gene-disease association is also supported by expression studies, an animal model, and in vitro functional assays (PMID: 12154356, 12356734, 12818158, 12867038, 28826773, 30170123, 33202260, 34341167). CARD11 has been demonstrated to be expressed in immune cells (PMID: 12818158) and be a positive regulator of NFkB activation (PMID: 12366734) and T-cell activation and proliferation (PMID: 12867038). The dominant-negative effect of CARD11 variants is typically confirmed in vitro in a CARD11-deficient T-cell line based on NFkB activity (PMID: 28628108, 28826773, 30170123, 33202260). These CARD11 variants have also been shown to cause impairment of NFkB activity and T-cell function in patient cells (PMID: 28826773, 33202260). A mouse model expressing a dominant-negative CARD11 variant recapitulated certain aspects of human disease (PMID: 34341167). In summary, CARD11 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant immunodeficiency 11B with atopic dermatitis. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b95442e5-dd79-4470-90a7-c64f32f348a9","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/603e8c98-82b7-41b5-8174-1fdbfc724a7d","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/603e8c98-82b7-41b5-8174-1fdbfc724a7d_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10080","date":"2022-03-15T13:12:20.080Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/603e8c98-82b7-41b5-8174-1fdbfc724a7d_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10080","date":"2022-04-13T00:55:59.068Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/603e8c98-82b7-41b5-8174-1fdbfc724a7d_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/603e8c98-82b7-41b5-8174-1fdbfc724a7d_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d09a715d-3cf2-4494-b5f3-70c62726dd07","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Decreased score from a 2 to a 1 because while the mice matched patient phenotypes of increased IgE levels, decreased IgM levels (sometimes), decreased NFkB activation following stimulation of cells, and defects in T cell activation and function, the mice did not develop atopic dermatitis nor was susceptibility to infection assessed.
