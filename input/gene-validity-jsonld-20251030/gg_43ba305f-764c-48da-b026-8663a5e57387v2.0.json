IBMPFD2 families present with an incomplete penetrance of disabling muscle weakness in most cases, osteolytic bone lesions consistent with Paget disease in around half of cases, and frontotemporal dementia in a handful of cases. At least 5 variants, all missense, have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data.\n\nVariants in *hnRNPA2B1* have been reported in individuals with the following disease entities: amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, inclusion body myopathy with early-onset Paget disease with or without frontotemporal dementia 2 (IBMPFD2) and oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy 2. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no differences in molecular mechanism and inheritance pattern of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and IBMPFD2. Therefore, the following disease entities have been lumped into one disease entity for this curation: amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (MONDO:0004976) and inclusion body myopathy with early-onset Paget disease with or without frontotemporal dementia 2 (OMIM:615422). The disease entity oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy 2 (MONDO:0958195) has been split from this curation for difference in phenotype (especially ptosis and eye movement paralysis) and a distinct difference in molecular mechanism (frameshift variants that create the same novel amino acid series at the C-terminus of the protein).\n\nVariants in this gene have been reported in at least 5 probands in 5 publications (PMID:37528043, 25617006, 25299611, 28389692, 23455423). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 10 additional family members across 2 families.\n\nThis gene-disease relationship is supported by experimental evidence including biochemical function, protein interaction, functional alteration in both patient and non patient cells and a non-human model organism. Splicing sensitive microarrays showed that *hnRNPA2B1* has intrinsic properties that make it particularly susceptible to relocalization within the cell that may result in splicing defects when under stress (PMID:22574288). Protein interaction with TDP-53 (TARDBP), which has been previously implicated in this disease, is demonstrated in the literature (PMID:16157593). Functional alteration consistent with the disease has been demonstrated in patient cells (PMID: 27773581, 23455423) and HeLa cells (PMID: 23455423). Finally, a supporting drosophila model exists but has not been scored at full points as it is not a particularly strong model for this human disease (PMID: 23455423).\n\nThis gene-disease pair was originally evaluated  to have a limited gene-disease relationship by the Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Spectrum Disorders Gene Curation Expert Panel on October 28, 2021. It was reevaluated on October 24, 2024. As a result of this reevaluation, the classification changed to a moderate gene-disease relationship. This classification change is due to a reevaluation of the lumping and splitting; the prior curation was completed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (MONDO:0004976) as the disease entity and in the re-curation the group has decided to lump amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and multisystem proteinopathy under the disease entity inclusion body myopathy with early-onset Paget disease with or without frontotemporal dementia 2 (MONDO:0014178). This lumping allowed both genetic and experimental evidence available at the time of the last curation, but excluded due to disease entity, to be scored. Since the original curation one more case has been added to the literature and is scored in this curation (PMID:37528043). \n\nThis classification was approved by the ClinGen Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Spectrum Disorders Gene Curation Expert Panel on the meeting date October 24, 2024 (SOP Version 11). \n\n\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/43ba305f-764c-48da-b026-8663a5e57387","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1ffe711b-1ff6-4b11-b329-c0f820904764","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","changes":[{"id":"cg:sopChange"},{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},{"id":"cg:newEvidence"},{"id":"cg:classificationChange"},{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1ffe711b-1ff6-4b11-b329-c0f820904764_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10096","date":"2024-11-12T19:43:28.858Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1ffe711b-1ff6-4b11-b329-c0f820904764_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10096","date":"2024-10-24T19:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["RecurationNewEvidence"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1ffe711b-1ff6-4b11-b329-c0f820904764_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1ffe711b-1ff6-4b11-b329-c0f820904764_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e1b28d2c-364c-4077-8990-8aa69b6b206f","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ea9bdfd6-260d-4cb8-8fa6-69f910966d6e","type":"Finding","dc:description":"In this study, the authors identified several proteins that can interact directly with TDP-43, in particular hnRNP A1 and hnRNP A2/B1.

TDP-43 could bind hnRNP A2 while interacting with (ug)m-repeated sequences, but TDP-43 could not bind hnRNP A2 when the latter was bound to its high affinity RNA target sequence (Fig. 10). This observation suggests that the functionality of this interaction is tightly regulated according to which of the two proteins happens to bind to the RNA.

EM revealed that wild-type hnRNPA2 spontaneously formed self-seeding fibrils (Fig. 4f, h; supplementary figure 7), like due to containing steric-zipper motifs that give rise to the spine of an amyloid fibril. Authors deleted the steric zipper residues 287–292 from hnRNPA2 and assessed fibrillization in vitro. Importantly, hnRNPA2Δ287–292 did NOT form fibrils (Fig. 4e, g). Moreover, hnRNPA2Δ287–292 did not fibrillize when seeded by fibrils of wild-type or mutant hnRNPA2 (Supplementary Fig. 7c). Thus, residues 287–292 of hnRNPA2 are critical for spontaneous and seeded fibrillization of the full-length protein. Collectively, these findings indicate that steric zipper motifs centered in the PrLD of wild-type hnRNPA2 are critical to its intrinsic tendency to fibrillize and that disease mutations introduce more potent steric zippers, which accelerate nucleation and polymerization (Supplementary Fig. 6). Importantly, the disease mutation greatly accelerated hnRNPA2 fibrillization (Fig. 4e–h). In all cases, the lag phase was curtailed and fibrillization was well advanced while the wild-type protein remained in lag phase. Thus, the disease mutations directly promote nucleation of hnRNPA2 into fibrils. Moreover, fibrils formed by hnRNPA2-D290V not only seeded their own assembly (Supplementary Fig. 7b, f, g), but also promoted fibrillization of their respective wild-type counterparts (Supplementary Fig. 7d, i).","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23455423","rdfs:label":"Kim Functional Alteration (Sedimentation Analysis)"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/efdbe83e-53d1-4089-8844-51860a6bc06a","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b4996899-ca77-4771-9de6-4c153c123ae3","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Disease mutations may promote excess incorporation of hnRNPA2 into stress granules and drive the formation of cytoplasmic inclusions.

They only considered those variants rare in database [allele frequency less than 0.1% in dbSNP, the 1000 Genomes Project, and an in-house database from BGI (1100 control exomes)], presumed protein-altering (coding indels, non-synonymous variants, and splicing site vari- ants), and detected in two affected members but not in the unaffected individuals with an autosomal dominant mode as candidate disease-causing variant. In total, they identified seven candidate variants, of which a heterozygous variant in exon 10 of hnRNPA2B1 gene was left as the most possible candidate mutation while considering the phenotype (Tables s2, s3).
