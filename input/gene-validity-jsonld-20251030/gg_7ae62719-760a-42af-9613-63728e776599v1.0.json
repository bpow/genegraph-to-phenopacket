Biallelic variant in *RAD51C* was first identified in a patient with Fanconi anemia complementation group O (FANCO) in 2010 by Vaz et al. (PMID: 20400963). *RAD51C* is a member of the RAD51 gene family. The protein of RAD51 family members are known to be involved in the homologous recombination and repair of DNA. RAD51C protein can interact with other RAD51 paralogs and is reported to be important for Holliday junction resolution. Monoallelic *RAD51C* variants were also linked to autosomal dominant familial ovarian cancer and triple negative breast cancer. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we have split autosomal dominant triple negative breast cancer and ovarian cancer into separate curations due to phenotypic variability and different inheritance patterns. Therefore, this curation solely focuses on autosomal recessive FANCO. Three variants (1 intronic variant predicted to result in splice effect and 2 missense variants) identified in 2 families are included in this curation (2.6 points; PMIDs: 20400963, 29278735). The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss of function (LOF). This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence including animal models and biomedical function studies (2.5 points; PMIDs: 22167183, 30540754, 36906610). The cells with loss of *RAD51C* or expressing *RAD51C* variants  exhibited a marked increase in the frequency of interstrand cross-links and double strand breaks. Knockout zebrafish model exhibited a partial female sex reversal. This reversal may illustrate that the *RAD51C* gene is important for gonadogenesis and may reflect the commonly observed hypogonadism in FA probands. Mice with double knockout of Rad51c and Brca2 demonstrates phenotypes seen in FA patients including DNA replication instability, higher spontaneous chromosomal aberrations, bone marrow failure, leukemia, reduced survivability. Combination of genetic and experimental evidence has not demonstrated convincing definitive validity of *RAD51C* gene in inherited FANCO. In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. More evidence is needed to support the role of *RAD51C* in FANCO.\n\nThis gene-disease pair was originally evaluated as moderate by the General Gene Curation GCEP on 1/5/2017. This re-curation was approved by the ClinGen Hereditary Diseases GCEP on 07/28/2023 (SOP Version 9).\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7ae62719-760a-42af-9613-63728e776599","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ea7ea36f-955c-4478-b5f6-12ff0a0dbf0b","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ea7ea36f-955c-4478-b5f6-12ff0a0dbf0b_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10023","date":"2023-12-21T01:39:19.247Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ea7ea36f-955c-4478-b5f6-12ff0a0dbf0b_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10023","date":"2023-12-20T18:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["RecurationNewEvidence","RecurationFrameworkChange"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ea7ea36f-955c-4478-b5f6-12ff0a0dbf0b_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ea7ea36f-955c-4478-b5f6-12ff0a0dbf0b_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4defa3e5-d296-4f5f-83da-f9552c1b36d8","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"While this model does replicate FA better than the monogenic model it does have a double KO with BRCA2.

The results showed that G2 arrest of the affected individual’s fibroblasts was rescued specifically by expression of the wild-type RAD51C (Fig. 2c,d) but not by vector-mediated overexpression of the RAD51CG773A mutant cDNA (Fig. 2e). We also tested the effect of the mutation by expressing the wild-type or mutant RAD51C in two other eukaryotic cell lines that are deficient in the RAD51C protein. The hamster cell line irs3 has a splice-site mutation in Rad51c that causes skipping of exon 6 (ref. 5). We performed cell cycle analysis after MMC challenge of irs3 cells that had been transduced with retroviral vectors containing either the human wild-type or the mutant RAD51CG773A cDNA. The results (Fig. 2f–h) demonstrated that whereas the wild-type protein restored MMC resistance in irs3 cells, expression of the mutant protein resulted in only a modest degree of correction of cross-linker sensitivity when compared to transduction with the control vector.
