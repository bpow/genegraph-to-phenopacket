{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3b2f2f7b-a2b5-4f6a-b1f8-6df0fbef55c6v1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"The relationship between DNM1L and autosomal recessive Leigh syndrome spectrum was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of October 12, 2020. The DNM1L gene encodes Dynamin 1-like protein, a member of the dynamin superfamily of GTPases. This protein mediates mitochondrial and peroxisomal fission. Defects in DNM1L lead to impaired mitochondrial fission and therefore impaired mitochondrial replication, distribution, transport, and dynamics. DNM1L also has a role in peroxisomal fission.\n\nThe DNM1L gene has been reported only once in relation to autosomal recessive Leigh syndrome spectrum, in 2018 (PMID: 29110115).  This gene has also been implicated in autosomal dominant Leigh syndrome spectrum (please see separate curation), as well as other non-Leigh syndrome spectrum phenotypes such as optic atrophy and neonatal or infantile-onset encephalopathy. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included one homozygous variant identified in one case in one publication (PMID: 29110115). No segregation data were available. Loss of function is suspected to be the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease association is also supported by biochemical function, expression, and animal models (PMIDs: 30361041, 18853439, 19578372).\n\nIn summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on October 12, 2020 (SOP Version 7).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3b2f2f7b-a2b5-4f6a-b1f8-6df0fbef55c6","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0a922695-f136-44f8-ab1a-6581e0efafec","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0a922695-f136-44f8-ab1a-6581e0efafec_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2021-06-30T14:45:26.262Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0a922695-f136-44f8-ab1a-6581e0efafec_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2021-06-30T14:45:17.300Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0a922695-f136-44f8-ab1a-6581e0efafec_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ee0cc185-2451-4af2-a800-6edc0e38d706_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"DNML1 forms multimers; whole cell lysates from patient fibroblasts, by western blot, showed increased levels of monomeric DRP-1(DNML1) compared to the oligomerized form.
