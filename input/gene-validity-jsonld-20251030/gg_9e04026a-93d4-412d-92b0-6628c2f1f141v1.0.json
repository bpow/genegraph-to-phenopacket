Variants in SUOX were ﬁrst reported in humans with this disease as early as 1996 (Rupar et al., PMID 9050047). At least  31 variants (missense, nonsense, frameshift, splicing) in 47 patients have been reported in the literature (Claerhout et al., 2018; PMID 28980090). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level and experimental data. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. This gene-disease association is supported by biochemical assays. In summary, SUOX is deﬁnitively associated with autosomal recessive isolated sulfite oxidase deficiency. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. The classification was approved by the ClinGen Aminoacidopathy Gene Curation Expert Panel on March 22nd, 2019.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9e04026a-93d4-412d-92b0-6628c2f1f141","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/be1ff294-4444-4d39-a507-a2115bcdcd58","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/be1ff294-4444-4d39-a507-a2115bcdcd58_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10011","date":"2019-03-22T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/be1ff294-4444-4d39-a507-a2115bcdcd58_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10011","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/be1ff294-4444-4d39-a507-a2115bcdcd58_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4ad492bf-b65e-4f6a-9d81-a62482da4d6d_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Nomenclature for this variant found in PMID: 28980090.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/61c977c0-12e9-4f82-9dd5-bdfd8d468052","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9050047","rdfs:label":"Rupar 1996 Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Days","detectionMethod":"Total RNA extracted from fibroblasts and mRNA was isolated.
