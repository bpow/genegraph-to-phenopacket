The *MT-ND6* gene encodes the NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) core subunit ND6. Defects of this protein lead to complex I deficiency.\n\nThe *MT-ND6* gene was first reported in relation to maternally inherited Leigh syndrome spectrum in 2000 (PMID: 10894222). Evidence supporting the gene-disease relationship between *MT-ND6* and Leigh syndrome spectrum includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included 4 variants in 17 cases (1 with m.14439G>A, 4 with m.14459G>A, 11 with m.14487T>C, and 1 with m.14600G>A) from 12 publications (PMIDs: 15576045, 20019223, 10894222, 14684687, 21196529, 17535832, 19103152, 21749722, 23813926, 25356405, 14595656, 19062322). Of note, while Gene Curation SOP Version 8 maxes case level missense variant total score at 7, the Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel agreed the maximum score would be 12 given that the majority of pathogenic mitochondrial DNA variants are missense variants (the total score for genetic level evidence in this curation was 17). Segregation information is scored as case level evidence according to the criteria established by the Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel. Loss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease association is also supported by known protein interaction, functional alteration in non-patient cells, and animal models (PMIDs: 27509854, 8622678, 23129651, 33536343). \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support this gene-disease relationship, including that more than three years have elapsed from the first proposal of the association. This classification was approved by the NICHD U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on May 17, 2021 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f9c734d7-5a44-4c6d-9589-ae10dafb9cb5","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/836f975f-27f5-47c9-a58e-35089b6b39e6","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/836f975f-27f5-47c9-a58e-35089b6b39e6_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2022-07-06T18:53:07.782Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/836f975f-27f5-47c9-a58e-35089b6b39e6_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2021-05-17T04:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"\n","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/836f975f-27f5-47c9-a58e-35089b6b39e6_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/836f975f-27f5-47c9-a58e-35089b6b39e6_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/83b60a94-a27d-4a54-b9f8-68f241c45448","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Neuronal phenotype including predisposition to epilepsy: 0.5","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1f86fefb-9c7a-4538-8e9c-61e8721ef057","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Further characterization of the mouse described in 23129651: Lin et al. 2012.

The mice showed an altered EEG background power compared to wildtype mice which corresponds to similar observations in ASD patients. Significantly, the ND6P25L mice were more prone to induced seizures than the WT controls (flurothyl ether exposure, Fig 4).  Analysis of mitochondrial respiration and ROS production of the cortex, hippocampus, and ND6P25L olfactory bulb of the and WT mice using the Oroboros O2k Respirometer showed differential defects across the brain regions. The most significant decrease in global mitochondrial respiration and complex I-linked respiration was within the cortex (Fig 6), mitochondrial ROS production was increased in the cortex in association with complex I and complex II respiration with ADP as well as for FCCP-stimulated maximum respiration (Fig 7).

Mitochondrial OXPHOS analysis of LT13 versus LMTK− cells revealed that the ND6 P25L mutation reduced complex I–specific activity by 23%. \nThe enucleated clone was fused with mouse embryonic stem cells in which mitochondria had been removed. The resulting cybrid line was used to create mtDNA ND6 G13997A P25L mutant mice. These mice recapitulated LHON, they exhibited reduced retinal function by ERG and age related decline in central smaller caliber optic nerve fibers with sparing of the larger peripheral fibers. \n\nAltered mitochondrial morphology (Fig 2): Mitochondria in the optic tracts of the ND6 P25L mutants were abnormal and increased in number. The ND6 P25L mitochondria often appeared to be hollowed and possessed irregular cristae (Fig. 2D and Fig. S5B), with 31.5% more of the ND6 P25L mitochondria being abnormal at 14 months. Axons filled with abnormal mitochondria often demonstrated marked thinning of the myelin sheath.\n\nAltered Liver Mitochondria Complex I Activity in ND6 P25L Mice: Complex I activity was reduced in the liver of the mutant mice by 29% (Fig 3a) and there was a 25% decrease in mitochondrial oxygen consumption compare to wildtype mice. The protein levels of complex I were comparable to wildtype. \n\nAnalysis of brain mitochondrial H2O2 production revealed that ND6 P25L mitochondria had elevated ROS production during forward complex I electron transport from glutamate and malate but marked suppression of ROS production during RET from succinate in the presence of oligomycin (Fig 4).
