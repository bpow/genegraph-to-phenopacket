{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ee0ca91a-cbb6-4c4b-b130-3e7196bb55ecv1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"*GYS1* was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive glycogen storage disease due to muscle and heart glycogen synthase deficiency in 2007 (Kollberg et al., PMID: 17928598). The primary features of this condition include exercise intolerance, tonic-clonic seizures, and sudden cardiac death. The underlying mechanism is an inability to synthesize glycogen in skeletal and cardiac muscle.\n\nFour variants (nonsense, frameshift, canonical splice site) that have been reported in three probands in three publications (PMIDs: 17928598, 19699667, 21958591) are included in this curation. The mechanism of pathogenicity is biallelic loss of function. This gene-disease association is also supported by expression studies, functional alteration in patient cells, and animal models (PMID: 15282316, 25613900, 26977394). In summary, *GYS1* is definitively associated with autosomal recessive glycogen storage disease due to muscle and heart glycogen synthase deficiency. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time without the emergence of contradictory evidence. This classification was approved by the ClinGen General Inborn Errors of Metabolism GCEP on 9/8/2023 (SOP Version 9).\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ee0ca91a-cbb6-4c4b-b130-3e7196bb55ec","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4b85c829-f66a-4c23-8a59-58f17bdaefb0","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4b85c829-f66a-4c23-8a59-58f17bdaefb0_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10097","date":"2024-02-12T19:18:28.409Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4b85c829-f66a-4c23-8a59-58f17bdaefb0_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10097","date":"2024-02-12T19:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4b85c829-f66a-4c23-8a59-58f17bdaefb0_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4b85c829-f66a-4c23-8a59-58f17bdaefb0_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/767cac32-9231-4dc2-9838-11df8d8fae6c","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/643ef94b-2161-4a95-a498-c46b0ecdcdca","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Exercise intolerance was observed in multiple human GYS1 deficiency patients, and this was correlated with a loss of glycogen in skeletal and cardiac muscle.
