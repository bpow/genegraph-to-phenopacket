CBS encodes cystathione beta-synthase which catalyses the first step of the transsulfuration pathway, from homocysteine to cystathione. Variants in CBS were first reported in humans with this disorder in 1992 (Kozich and Kraus, PMID 1301198). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Twenty-one unique variants were curated (missense, nonsense, frameshift, and splice site) in 15 probands from 8 publications, and three of these probands each had two affected siblings in whom CBS variants were identified (Kozich and Kraus, 1992, PMID 1301198; De Franchis et al, 1999, PMID 10408774; Sebastio et al, 1999, PMID 7762555; Urreizti et al, 2003, PMID 12815602; Katsushima et al, 2006, PMID 16307898; Suri et al, 2014, PMID 25455305; Gong et al, 2015, PMID 26667307; Li et al, 2018, PMID 29508359). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. The mechanism for disease is biallelic loss of function. This gene-disease relationship is supported by the biochemical function of CBS, which is consistent with the biochemical features in patients with homocystinuria (including elevated plasma total homocysteine and methionine) (Selim et al, 1959, PMID 13654400; Jhee and Kruger, 2005, PMID 15890029), functional studies in yeast, bacteria, and cultured cells, including chaperone studies in fibroblasts from patients with homocystinuria (Shan et al, 1998, PMID 9590298; Melenovská et al, 2018, PMID 25331909), as well as the biochemical and clinical features of mouse models (Gupta et al, 2009, PMID 18987302) and enzyme replacement studies in mice (Matjan et al, 2018, PMID 29398487). More information is available but the maximum experimental evidence score (6 points) has been reached. In summary, CBS is definitively associated with classic homocystinuria. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Aminoacidopathy Gene Curation Expert Panel on April 12, 2019.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7a81d1c5-0224-4797-bd81-1bb4ce9d7c83","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a9086d29-767b-4ab8-9274-1249b5480834","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"},"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a9086d29-767b-4ab8-9274-1249b5480834_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10011","date":"2020-09-16T19:23:02.894Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a9086d29-767b-4ab8-9274-1249b5480834_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10011","date":"2019-04-12T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a9086d29-767b-4ab8-9274-1249b5480834_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a9086d29-767b-4ab8-9274-1249b5480834_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/94f9bf46-87f5-449f-b794-19f58805bc1c","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The score is increased because CBS has been extensively characterized and its function is clearly consistent with the biochemical findings in patients with homocystinuria.

Since the first purification of CBS, this enzyme has been extensively characterized (for review, see Jhee and Kruger, 2005, PMID 15890029). The function of CBS is consistent with the biochemical abnormalities found in patients with classic homocysteinuria. CBS catalyzes the condensation of homocysteine with serine to form cystathionine, which is converted to cysteine by cystathionine lyase (see Figure 1 in Kruger, 2017, PMID 28583326). In the absence of CBS activity, homocysteine accumulates resulting in marked elevations of total homocysteine measured in plasma, and homocystinuria. Patients with homocystinuria caused by CBS deficiency also have marked elevations of plasma methionine due to conversion of homocysteine to methionine by homocysteine methyltransferase. These patients also tend to have decreased plasma cystathionine, decreased total cysteine (tCys), increased S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), and increased S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH).","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/13654400","rdfs:label":"Function of cystathione synthetase","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a9086d29-767b-4ab8-9274-1249b5480834_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d7b91263-06bb-4c08-b921-fe626d3895fe","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e4fc928e-485a-4ea5-829d-bd7e80eaf011","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Yeast lacking endogenous CBS are cysteine auxotrophs. This phenotype can be rescued by expression of wild-type human CBS protein. The authors report two experimentally generated CBS variants, both of which lead to a C-terminal truncation of about 25% of the protein, and which restore the function of 8 out of 9 human CBS missense variants when expressed in cis in yeast lacking CBS. The activity of these C-terminal truncation variants was 10 x normal suggesting that the C terminus of CBS acts as a negative regulator of enzyme activity. S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet) is known to be an activator of CBS. A tenfold increase in enzyme activity with AdoMet was observed for wild-type CBS but only a minor increase was seen for truncated wild-type CBS. A pathogenic variant, p.D444N, abolishes AdoMet-stimulation of CBS in vitro. These observations are consistent with the C-terminal domain being required for Ado Met regulation. This work not only demonstrates the function of CBS, as indicated by enzyme assays demonstrating conversion of homocystine to cysteine, and the requirement for cysteine in yeast lacking CBS, but also elucidates the molecular mechanism involved in patients with homocystinuria caused by CBS deficiency; showing that some missense variants have problems with activation rather than lack of catalytic activity. The authors suggest the possibility pharmacological therapies that could disrupt the ability of the C-terminal fragment to inhibit catalytic activity.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9590298","rdfs:label":"Yeast auxotroph studies"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3f987bfd-9e72-4c85-9fb3-3254f0ac6a24","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0efec4a9-6155-4f5e-8ea5-090b564fb854","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Seven missense variants (p.H65R, p.A114V, p.K102N, p.R125Q, p.R266K, p.I278T and p.R369C) were expressed in CHO-K1 cells.

The frameshift variant is not in gnomAD.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/dc6bae88-7f8a-421d-90fc-8bea4d5c6958","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29508359","rdfs:label":"Patient 4","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":7,"detectionMethod":"Sequencing of all 15 coding exons of CBS and flanking intronic regions from leukocyte genomic DNA.","firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0010864","obo:HP_0000545","obo:HP_0000939"],"previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"Plasma total homocysteine 207 (normal range < 15 μmol/L), urine homocysteine >500 (normal range < 20 μmol/L), plasma methionine 334 (normal range 10–50 μmol/L).","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/68fecd5b-0443-421a-b620-ef8a3a80846e_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29508359","allele":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0d611d35-1b0d-4a5b-b50c-35072750bb91","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NC_000021.9:g.43056878dup","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA913184986"}},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/75d25f9e-e84f-4e4a-833b-e1d3ea05ab71","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000071.2(CBS):c.374G>A (p.Arg125Gln)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/197625"}}]}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/398c7686-5e36-4bd3-9f92-88eb77b16b31_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"This patient is presumed to be compound heterozygous for two missense variants, p.G307S and p.R336C, based on sequencing of DNA from the parents. The score is reduced because these variant were not confirmed in the patient. When expressed in E.Coli, the p.R336C variant did not have any measurable activity. The highest population minor allele frequency for p.G307S is 0.0003174 (European, non-Finnish), and for p.R336C is 0.00004417 (European, non-Finnish); no homozygotes in any population. p.Gly307Ser has been reported in multiple patients with homocystinuria (Kruger et al, 2003; PMID14635102). Glycine 307 is located in the catalytic site. The Gly307Ser variant severely reduces enzyme activity when expressed in E. coli and yeast (Hu et al, 1993, PMID 7506602; Kruger et al, 2003; PMID14635102) and results in protein misfolding (Kozich et al, 2010, PMID 20506325).
