Hyper IgM syndrome (HIGM) is a rare immunodeficiency characterized by impaired class switch recombination (CSR) and somatic hypermutation (SHM) resulting in abnormally low or absent serum IgG, IgA, and IgE and normal or elevated levels of serum IgM. Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) is involved in somatic SHM, gene conversion, and CSR in B-lymphocytes by deaminating C to U during transcription of Ig-variable and Ig-switch region DNA. Patients with autosomal dominant HIGM show a complete impairment of CSR but preserved SHM. The mechanism for disease is proposed to be a dominant negative effect due to loss of the C-terminal region. Of note, *AICDA* is also related to autosomal recessive HIGM. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found difference in molecular mechanisms (biallelic loss of function vs. monoallelic dominant negative), inheritance pattern (recessive vs. dominant)  and phenotypic variability (autoimmune disease has only been reported in the recessive form). Therefore, the disease entities have been split and autosomal recessive HIGM has been curated separately.\n\nAt least 3 unique variants (Arg190Ter, Leu189Ter, and Val186Ter) have been reported in 8 probands with autosomal dominant HIGM2, segregating in at least 13 additional family members (PMIDs: 12910268, 14564357, 15893695, 32423680, 35570134, 17560278). This gene-disease relationship is supported by animal models (PMIDs: 10373455, 25252954) that partially recapitulate disease, expression studies (PMIDs: 10373455, 10950930) showing expression specifically in B cells of lymphoid tissues, biochemical function studies (PMID: 12692563), and functional alteration experiments showing defective CSR (PMID: 29136157, 12910268) due to a dominant negative effect (PMID: 29136157). In summary, *AICDA* is definitively associated with autosomal Dominant-Negative Hyper-IgM syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been held up over time.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6c23925b-8fb0-4cb8-a351-075a8229a695","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/dc16b40a-e78d-432a-88e8-f1ee6c0735f3","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":[{"id":"cg:sopChange"},{"id":"cg:summaryChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/dc16b40a-e78d-432a-88e8-f1ee6c0735f3_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10080","date":"2024-08-28T19:32:46.842Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/dc16b40a-e78d-432a-88e8-f1ee6c0735f3_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10080","date":"2024-08-28T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["DiseaseNameUpdate","RecurationNewEvidence"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/dc16b40a-e78d-432a-88e8-f1ee6c0735f3_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/dc16b40a-e78d-432a-88e8-f1ee6c0735f3_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/067c18fc-0845-4b5e-a9c6-f7e963322e79","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"These data are in agreement with the Human Protein Atlas which reports enriched expression in lymphoid tissues.","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2d107279-bff4-45f3-9ed2-bb8da79d364f","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Expression  of  the  human  AID  mRNA  was  examined   by   RT-PCR   analysis  of cDNAs  in 15  human  tissues.

An immunization with SRBC, known to initiate immunological responses, was followed by poly(A)+ RNA extraction from spleens of mice and subjected to Northern blot hybridization. AID mRNA expression was barely detectable in spleens without immunization, and significant up-regulation (3–5-fold induction) was demonstrated 5 and 13 days after immunization. \n\nTo determine which cells express AID mRNAs in immunized spleen, RT-PCR was performed using fractionated splenic cells, showing that AID mRNAs were observed in the non-T and CD191 cell fractions, and indicating that SRBC immunization induced AID mRNA expression in CD19+ splenic B cells.\n\nBecause the timing of AID mRNA up-regulation in the spleen was roughly synchronous with the onset of GC formation after immunization, the authors next investigated the precise localization of AID mRNAs in lymphoid organs using in situ hybridization. When the antisense AID cRNA was used, distinct focal signals were seen in spleen sections from mice immunized with SRBC for 5 days. By contrast, no signals were detected in unimmunized spleen sections with the same probe, in agreement with the data obtained by Northern blot hybridization. Peanut agglutinin staining of serial sections showed that both Peyer’s patches and immunized spleens contained GC, and that signals derived from the antisense probe colocalized with GC. On the other hand, regardless of immunization, the sense probe produced almost no signal in spleens or Peyer’s patches. GCs were rarely observed in spleens from  unimmunized mice. Taken together, these data demonstrate that AID mRNAs are specifically induced in GCs, which contain mostly activated B cells after encounter with antigens.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10373455","rdfs:label":"induced expression","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1e31bb19-a5a3-4d05-b6de-fba294d19d06","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"residue.
