The *TRMU* gene encodes the tRNA 5-methylaminomethyl-2-thiouridylate methyltransferase, a mitochondrion-specific tRNA-modifying enzyme.\n\n*TRMU* was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive primary mitochondrial disease in 2009 (PMID: 19732863). While various names have been given to the constellation of features seen in those with *TRMU*-related disorders, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the TRMU phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework. Of note, *TRMU* was first curated by this Expert Panel for its association with Leigh syndrome spectrum (LSS) on December 16, 2020 (SOP V7), with a final classification of Moderate. This current curation for the association with primary mitochondrial disease includes the three cases included in the LSS curation.\n\nEvidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included seven missense variants, two nonsense variants, one frameshift variant and one variant predicted to impact splicing in eight cases from six publications (PMIDs: 23625533, 28562522, 30740308, 33205917, 33365252, 36305855). However there have been at least 60 cases reported in the medical literature (PMID: 36305855). Affected individuals have a spectrum of clinical features including fatal infantile multiorgan system failure, LSS, and acute infantile liver failure that may spontaneously resolve.\n\nThe mechanism of disease is loss of function. This gene-disease association is also supported by the known biochemical function of *TRMU* in modification of mitochondrial tRNAs, as well as functional alteration in patient cells (PMID: 21153446) and several model systems including nematode (PMID: 28732077), zebrafish (PMID: 30137487), and mouse (PMID: 27689697).\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between *TRMU* and primary mitochondrial disease. This relationship has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on May 23, 2024 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5092f7b5-8389-4712-8bef-839255aca725","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d025dc5a-fd47-4418-bd20-e2dca69e3308","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d025dc5a-fd47-4418-bd20-e2dca69e3308_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2024-05-23T04:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d025dc5a-fd47-4418-bd20-e2dca69e3308_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2025-01-13T14:52:45.812Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d025dc5a-fd47-4418-bd20-e2dca69e3308_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d025dc5a-fd47-4418-bd20-e2dca69e3308_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c7771870-7222-4763-a933-f6de139ce51c","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Constitutive KO\nScore 0.5 points from embryonic lethality\n\nliver conditional KO\n0.5 - Laboratory examinations of 3-week-old mice revealed significantly elevated plasma levels of lactate, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) in Mtu1LKO mice\n0.5 – Markedly reduced translation in hepatocytes from Mtu1LKO (decrease in steady state levels of NDUFB8, MTCO1). \n0.5 - Decreased activities of respiratory chain  I (70%), III (67%), IV (52%), but not II (Statistically significant, and raw values don’t account for upregulated CS) \n0.5 – In the livers of Mtu1LKO mice, the s2 modification was nearly absent in the three mt-tRNA\n","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6b314f93-bd1d-44f0-9690-2e16ffa1c545","type":"Finding","dc:description":"0.5 - Laboratory examinations of 3-week-old mice revealed significantly elevated plasma levels of lactate, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) in Mtu1LKO mice\n0.5 – Markedly reduced translation in hepatocytes from Mtu1LKO (decrease in steady state levels of NDUFB8, MTCO1). \n0.5 - Decreased activities of respiratory chain  I (70%), III (67%), IV (52%), but not II (Statistically significant, and raw values don’t account for upregulated CS) \n0.5 – In the livers of Mtu1LKO mice, the s2 modification was nearly absent in the three mt-tRNA\nThere was a trace of τm5s2-containing mt-tRNAs, but this result was most likely derived from non-hepatic cell\nNote: Interestingly, these mt-tRNAs were partially s2-modified even in the livers of Mtu1Flox mice; 40~70% of the mt-tRNAGlu, mt-tRNAGln and mt-tRNALys contained τm5s2U and s2U modifications\nMitochondrial histology is abnormal with swollen or complete loss of cristae\n16-week-old liver Mtu1 KO mice were alive and exhibited sustained liver function.
