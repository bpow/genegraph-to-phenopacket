At least 17 unique variants (missense, in-frame indel, nonsense, frameshift and large deletions) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level and experimental data.\n\nSummary of Case Level Data: \nVariants in this gene have been reported in at least 19 probands in 12 publications (20571508, 20950788, 20848658, 24214399, 25853299, 24083349, 6647308, 27657687, 28735298, 28884888, 30385778, 29330474).\n\nMore evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached.\n\nThis gene-disease association is supported by animal models, expression studies and in vitro functional assays.\n\nIn summary, FOXP1 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant intellectual disability-severe speech delay-mild dysmorphism syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.\n\nThis classification was approved by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism Working Group on 05/09/2019\n(SOP Version 6)","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7cd098d4-36db-4ef3-888c-1fda0711f3dc","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/db1c240c-7ffb-4a95-92ad-da9e8af2adc6","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/db1c240c-7ffb-4a95-92ad-da9e8af2adc6_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/db1c240c-7ffb-4a95-92ad-da9e8af2adc6_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2019-05-09T16:27:56.956Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/db1c240c-7ffb-4a95-92ad-da9e8af2adc6_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/db1c240c-7ffb-4a95-92ad-da9e8af2adc6_ad_dn_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b617b67f-cc82-402c-8f49-ce869e9c2a93_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Downgraded as missense variant but with luciferase reporter assays showing that the mutant protein had significant loss of repressive activity.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1f66bc91-8622-44a8-a8a1-f390037e2c56","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26647308","rdfs:label":"Patient 1","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":11,"detectionMethod":"In the case of Patient 1, whole-exome sequencing was performed\nby GeneDx (MD, USA).
