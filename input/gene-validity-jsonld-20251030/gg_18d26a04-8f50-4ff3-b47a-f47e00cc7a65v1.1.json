Bardet-Biedl syndrome is a multisystem disorder characterized by retinopathy, obesity, polydactyly, intellectual disability, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and/or genitourinary malformations, and renal malformations and/or renal disease Biallelic loss-of-function variants in at least 26 genes have been described in affected individuals. *LZTFL1* is thought to cause <1% of BBS cases  (Forsyth and Gunay-Aygun, 2023, PMID: 20301537).\n\n*LZTFL1* encodes “leucine zipper transcription factor-like 1”, a ubiquitously expressed cytoplasmic protein that interacts with the BBSome and regulates protein trafficking to the ciliary membrane. Together with the BBSome, LZTFL1 controls the ciliary trafficking of smoothened (SMO) and contributes to the sonic hedgehog (SHH) pathway regulation.\n\nSix variants (two nonsense, two frameshift, one missense, and one synonymous predicted to impact splicing) have been reported in six probands in five publications (Marion et al, 2012, PMID: 22510444; Schaeffer et al, 2014, PMID: 23692385; Gumus et al, 2021, PMID: 32686083; Nawaz et al, 2023, PMID: 37239474; Gnanasekaran et al, 2023, PMID: 37431782). The individuals reported have typical features of BBS but the polydactyly of the hands is mesoaxial rather than postaxial. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss of function. Total points for genetic evidence = 11.6 points.\n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence, including the biochemical function of the gene product, which is consistent with the clinical features observed in patients (Seo et al, 2011, PMID: 22072986; Eguether et al, 2014, PMID: 25446516), observations in cells from a patient (Marion et al, 2012, PMID: 22510444), the features observed in a knock out mouse model (Datta et al, 2015, PMID: 26216965), and results of a rescue experiment (Datta et al, 2020, PMID: 32568387). More experimental evidence is available in the literature but the maximum (6 points) has already been reached.\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *LZTFL1* and autosomal recessive LZTFL1-related ciliopathy. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Retina Gene Curation Expert Panel on January 4th, 2024 (SOP version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/18d26a04-8f50-4ff3-b47a-f47e00cc7a65","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e352868c-b5d8-451d-89ef-61a147ea7b4f","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e352868c-b5d8-451d-89ef-61a147ea7b4f_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10072","date":"2024-01-04T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e352868c-b5d8-451d-89ef-61a147ea7b4f_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10072","date":"2025-01-04T02:12:35.739Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["DiseaseNameUpdate"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e352868c-b5d8-451d-89ef-61a147ea7b4f_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e352868c-b5d8-451d-89ef-61a147ea7b4f_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/23d6b40c-d49d-481e-b567-dbf8eca69493","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/39df8d1b-348c-4116-a28d-a47128b68fdd","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Vertebrate hedgehog signaling is coordinated by the differential localization of the receptors patched-1 and Smoothened in the primary cilium.

Protein localization and expression, photoreceptor cell loss and retinal functions were examined at 1 month, 3 months and 6 months PTI. See Fig 2.\n- Expression of Lztfl1 in treated animals was confirmed.\n- There was increased expression of phototransduction proteins and BBSome components (previously noted to be reduced in the KO mouse)\n- The ONL of treated mice was about 2 rows of nuclei thicker than that of untreated mice (n = 4) (Fig. 3G), and preservation of photoreceptors was noted at 3 months and 6 months PTI. However, the ONL became gradually thinner as treated animals aged, suggesting that retinal degeneration continued but at a slower rate.\n- Mislocalization of IS proteins, STX3 and STXBP1 was partly corrected.\n- At 1 month post treatment, significantly more cones were found in treated retinas compared with age-matched, untreated retinas. The length of the cone OS was comparable to that of normal cones. However the number of cones gradually decreased with age.\n- At 1 month post treatment, scotopic ERG a- and b-waves and photopic ERG b-waves were markedly improved. At 3 months and 6 months, all ERG responses remained improved compared to untreated animlas but ERG amplitudes gradually decreased in treated animals.\n- At 9 months post treatment, ERG amplitudes and ONL thickness had decreased further while protein mislocalization was unchanged.\n\nIn summary, restoration of Lztfl1 expression at a very early stage of degeneration had long-term therapeutic effects but did not completely correct protein mislocalization or permanently stop degeneration.\nThe authors also studied animals treated at later stages of disease and found that  the therapeutic efficacy gradually declined as Lztfl1 expression was restored at later stages, with no treatment effect at the advanced stage (fig 4)\n","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32568387","rdfs:label":"Inducible rescue of Lztfl1 KO mouse","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:PhenotypeRescue"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanRescueCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/30d0b9f4-cdf8-4c69-8e1d-78a9d759e736","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ae402450-5400-49e3-b868-5e00ff741e7e","type":"Finding","dc:description":"The phenotype of Lztfl1 knock-out mice - obesity, retinal degeneration,  ventriculomegaly - was comparable to that of previously described BBS mouse models, including BBS1 and BBS3 (PMIDs: 18032602, 22139371).\nThe phenotype recapitulates some of the findings in humans with biallelic variants in LZTFL1 - obesity and retinal degeneration. \nThe loss of function mechanism is the same in the KO mice and humans with LZTFL1 variants. \n","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26216965","rdfs:label":"Lztfl1 knock out mice","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":6},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e352868c-b5d8-451d-89ef-61a147ea7b4f_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e5db2c92-547f-4497-93cd-3819a56a8d8d_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e5db2c92-547f-4497-93cd-3819a56a8d8d","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32686083","rdfs:label":"Gumus et al_2021: Patient 7","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":26,"allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/420a8f45-81d7-43e7-a963-4f44f5b18f8f","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_020347.4(LZTFL1):c.384G>A (p.Lys128=)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA433444516"}},"detectionMethod":"Variant detected by exome sequencing and verified by Sanger sequencing.","firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"BMI 22.4 kg/m2, \"Y-shaped synpolydactyly was observed between the 5th and 6th fingers of the right hand, insertional mesoaxial polydactyly was observed at the left hand (Figure 4b, c).\"\nAtrophic kidney, \n","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0000078","obo:HP_0010442","obo:HP_0000708","obo:HP_0001561","obo:HP_0000077","obo:HP_0000135","obo:HP_0006695","obo:HP_0000028"],"secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5a077d29-3f36-4eaa-98fc-914ea2e562a1_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32686083","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/420a8f45-81d7-43e7-a963-4f44f5b18f8f"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"}}},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5a077d29-3f36-4eaa-98fc-914ea2e562a1","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1.0,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5a077d29-3f36-4eaa-98fc-914ea2e562a1_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5a077d29-3f36-4eaa-98fc-914ea2e562a1_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"The variant alters the last nucleotide of exon 4.
