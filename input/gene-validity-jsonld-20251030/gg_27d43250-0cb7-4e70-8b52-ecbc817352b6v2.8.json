Currently, only missense changes have been reported in individuals with schizophrenia; these variants and this phenotype are not included as part of this curation. Due to observations of loss of function (LoF) variants in both ASD and ID, this gene has been curated using the disease term complex neurodevelopmental disorder.\n\n*SHANK2* was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant complex neurodevelopmental disorder (specifically, ASD and ID) in 2010 (Berkel et al., PMID: 20473310). Eight LoF variants (exonic deletions, nonsense, and frameshift) that have been reported in nine probands in seven publications (PMIDs: 20473310, 20531469, 22495306, 26350204, 28554332, 30564305, 30763456) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. All the scored variants were part of large cohort studies that did not necessarily include detailed descriptions of each individual’s phenotype. *SHANK2* is significantly constrained for LoF variants (pLI = 1, LOEUF = 0.42, gnomAD v4.1.0). The mechanism of pathogenicity is haploinsufficiency, based on protein truncating variants in affected individuals and functional studies in cells derived from an affected individual (PMID: 30911184). Missense variants have been observed in individuals with ASD and/or ID (PMID: 22346768); however, most of these variants were inherited from reportedly unaffected parents. These missense changes are currently classified as variants of uncertain significance and were not scored as part of this curation; additional evidence is needed to understand their role in disease causality. \n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence, including biochemical function (PMID: 28179641), patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (PMID: 30911184), and mouse models (PMID: 30072871). *SHANK2* is a member of the SHANK gene family (*SHANK1*, *SHANK2*, and *SHANK3*), which encodes scaffolding proteins that are enriched in the postsynaptic density of glutamatergic synapses and play a crucial role in synaptic development and function. *SHANK3* and *SHANK1* are also involved in neurodevelopmental disorders with ASD and ID.\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *SHANK2* and autosomal dominant complex neurodevelopmental disorder. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel on July 17, 2019 (SOP Version 6). As of October 2025, this record underwent administrative updates to include edits to the evidence summary and update scoring to be consistent with SOP Version 11.
