Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. \n\nNumerous pathogenic nonsense and frameshift variants in relation to Klippel-Feil syndrome have been submitted to ClinVar. Nine variants (nonsense, frameshift, splice-site) that have been reported in twelve probands in seven publications (PMIDs: 25748484, 27858739, 30932893. 31195167, 32184166, 32637634, 33179433) and in ClinVar (Variation ID: 3382539) are included in this curation. At least one variant, *MYO18B*:c.6905C>A (p.Ser2302Ter), reported in homozygosity in six affected individuals in the Saudi Arabian population (PMIDs: 25748484, 33179433), is suspected to be a founder variant. An additional report of four individuals harboring biallelic *MYO18B* variants and affected with congenital myopathy, cardiomyopathy, short stature, Klippel-Feil anomaly, and dysmorphisms has been described (Donkervoort et al., 2023 abstract presented at 2023 World Muscle Society Congress). Although heterozygous *MYO18B* missense variants were reported in patients affected by Klippel-Feil syndrome (PMID: 32278351), the overall mechanism for disease is postulated to be homozygous loss of function (PMID: 32184166). \n\nExperimental-level genetic evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes animal model (PMIDs: 27879346, 28104788), non-human cell model (PMID: 30581023) and mRNA expression studies (PMIDs: 12547197). Also of note, both clinical and functional evidence to date suggest variants in *MYO18B* are associated with congenital myopathy, not nemaline myopathy, although nemaline rods may occur as a secondary consequence of disease. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. \n\nThe *MYO18B*-autosomal recessive Klippel-Feil anomaly-myopathy-facial dysmorphism syndrome gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the Congenital Myopathies GCEP on June 28, 2021. It was reevaluated on April 28, 2025. As a result of this re-evaluation, the classification increased from Moderate to Definitive with the addition of two variants, experimental evidence from zebrafish and cell models, and application of current version of the gene curation guidelines. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Congenital Myopathies Gene Curation Expert Panel on the meeting date April 28, 2025 (SOP Version 11).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/865db48b-e88c-4f11-9f09-9404b0fcf512","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/00998e50-dd3f-4bfa-8500-34d34980d5c8","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":[{"id":"cg:classificationChange"},{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"},{"id":"cg:newEvidence"},{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},{"id":"cg:sopChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/00998e50-dd3f-4bfa-8500-34d34980d5c8_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10031","date":"2025-04-28T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/00998e50-dd3f-4bfa-8500-34d34980d5c8_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10031","date":"2025-07-17T11:07:21.668Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["RecurationNewEvidence"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/00998e50-dd3f-4bfa-8500-34d34980d5c8_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e8f34100-b59c-4f87-82e5-a5278a7e3bb5_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e8f34100-b59c-4f87-82e5-a5278a7e3bb5","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27858739","rdfs:label":"Malfatti Patient","ageType":"AgeAtDeath","ageUnit":"Weeks","ageValue":18,"allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/08cc560a-73bc-4d55-824c-a640ff394944","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_032608.7(MYO18B):c.6496G>T (p.Glu2166Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/224413"}},"detectionMethod":"Exome sequencing was performed on DNA samples from the index patient on a HiSeq 2000 (Illumina, San Diego, USA) using the Agilent 44M v2 SureSelect Exon enrichment kit at the BGI (Shenzhen, China).

The variant is not reported in gnomAD. The authors report that this variant is located in the final exon (exon 42/42) of the MYO18B gene, however based on the current canonical transcript (NM_032608.6) the variant is located in the penultimate exon (exon 43/44). RT-PCR of exons 40-42 in RNA from patient muscle biopsy compared to age-matched control, revealed no difference in signal intensity. These results suggest the variant does not alter mRNA stability and does not lead to nonsense mediated decay. Immunostaining of muscle sections using N-terminus and C-terminus myosin 18B antibodies show nuclear and cytoplasmic protein localization in similar signal intensity with the N-terminus antibody in patient and age-matched controls, but absence of C-terminus antibody staining in patient compared to control. Further, western blot on muscle samples from patient and control biopsy using the C-terminus antibody show no detectable signal in biopsy from patient (expected at 285 kD based on control). The authors suggest the variant leads to the formation of a truncated protein (lacking 401 residues from the C-terminal end), however the presence of this protein was not demonstrated by western blot with the N-terminus MYO18B antibody. An additional publication (Malfatti et al. Neurology. 2018 Apr 10;90(15 Supplement)) reports findings from an additional experiment to characterize the effect of this variant. Contractile measurements in individual permeabilized fibers obtained from muscle biopsy from the patient described in Malfatti et al., 2015 have a severely reduced maximal active tension caused by a reduced number of myosin-actin interactions during activation due to changes in cross bridge cycling kinetics and probably a lower number of intact myofibrils in the patient’s muscle fibers. The calcium sensitivity of force was reduced in the fibers of the patient and accompanied by a reduced cooperativity of activation. However this evidence is not associated with a PMID and no data was shown, only author interpretations of the results.
