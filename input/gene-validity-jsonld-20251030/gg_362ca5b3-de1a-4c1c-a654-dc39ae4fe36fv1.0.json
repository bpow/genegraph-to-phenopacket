The phenotypes associated with variants in *HUWE1* include varying degrees of intellectual disability, dysmorphic facial features, macro- and microcephaly, and short stature.\n\nAt least 8 unique variants (missense) reported in 18 probands from 9 publications (PMIDs:27130160, 27615324, 23721686, 26587761, 23092983, 18252232, 25652354, 24307393, 18047645) have been included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. \n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence including biochemical functional studies, animal models, rescue, and functional alteration of patient cells (PMIDs:28193319, 20007713, 20231446, 28445732, 18047645, 27130160). \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support the gene-disease relationship between *HUWE1* and non-syndromic X-linked intellectual disability. This classification was approved by the Intellectual Disability and Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel on October 20, 2017. As of June 2022, this record underwent administrative updates to include an evidence summary text and update scoring to be consistent with SOP Version 9.

The EBV-infection of the patients blood cells is required for immortalization and in itself causes changes to p53 expression, a substrate of HUWE1. From this we have no idea if there is a feedback loop of p53 and HUWE1, which could change expression levels. Thus, confidence in this assay is decreased.
