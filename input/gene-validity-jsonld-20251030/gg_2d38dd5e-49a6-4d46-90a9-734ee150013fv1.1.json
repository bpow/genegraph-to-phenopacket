Pathogenic variants in KCNJ2 are the cause of Andersen-Tawil Syndrome (ATS), a multisystem disorder whose manifestations include dysmorphic features and periodic paralysis. Although patients with ATS are at risk of developing ventricular arrhythmias, these are not typically torsades de pointes, the hallmark of LQTS. Furthermore, ECGs of patients with ATS demonstrate QT-U prolongation and not QT prolongation. Accordingly, the Expert Panel classified the level of evidence for this association as limited. \nNote: All LQTS genes were curated by 3 separate blinded teams. The evidence and scores reached by these 3 teams were reviewed by the LQTS Clinical Domain Expert Panel.
