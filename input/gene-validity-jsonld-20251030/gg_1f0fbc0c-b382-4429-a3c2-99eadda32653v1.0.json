{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1f0fbc0c-b382-4429-a3c2-99eadda32653v1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"The CEP290 gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive ciliopathies in 2006. Sayer et al., 2006 (PMID: 16682973) reported CEP290 variants in 7 families with Joubert syndrome and 1 with Senior-Loken syndrome; Valente et al., 2006 (PMID: 16682970) reported CEP290 variants in 5 families with Joubert syndrome related disorders; and den Hollander et al., 2006 (PMID: 16909394) reported CEP290 variants in 4 siblings with Leber congenital amaurosis. At least 300 mutations have been reported in humans, including frameshift, nonsense, splice site, missense, and large deletions. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data. 11 CEP290 gene variants that have been reported in 19 probands in 6 publications (PMIDs: 17345604, 16909394, 24807808, 16682970, 16682973, 27434533) are included in this curation. In particular, multiple probands were found to have a deep intronic CEP290 variant, c.2991+1655A>G, which is common among patients in the United States and Northwest Europe. This variant is commonly associated with non-syndromic retinal disease and has been shown to create cryptic exon and has been shown to result in mix of nonsense p.Cys998* and wild-type protein (PMID: 16909394). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The CEP290 gene has been associated with at least five conditions, Leber congenital amaurosis (MIM 611755), Bardet-Biedl syndrome (MIM 615991), Joubert syndrome (MIM 610188), Meckel syndrome (MIM 611134), and Senior-Loken syndrome (610189). Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in molecular mechanism or inheritance pattern. In addition, there are not clear genotype-phenotype correlations for CEP290 conditions. Recent studies (PMID: 31879347; https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.01.26.477596) suggest that that this variation in phenotype may be due to genetic modifiers for CEP290-related conditions. For this curation, the disease entities have been lumped into one disease entity, CEP290-related ciliopathy (MONDO: 0100451). The mechanism for disease is homozygous loss of function/reduced function. This gene-disease association is supported by animal models, expression studies, and in vitro functional assays. CEP290 is expressed in the developing human kidney and brain (PMID: 23028714), the developing zebrafish cerebellum and retina (PMID: 16682973), and the mouse retina (PMID: 16632484). In vitro, CEP290 has been shown to interact with RPGR, a gene associated with inherited retinal disease (PMID 16632484) and NPHP5/IQCB1, a gene associated with Senior-Loken syndrome/nephronophthisis (PMID: 18723859). A zebrafish morpholino knockout resulted in a phenotype similar to Joubert syndrome with neurologic, ocular, and renal differences (PMID: 16682973). Furthermore, in human fibroblast cultures, CEP290 mutations have been shown to induce a ciliogenesis defect (PMID: 24807808). There are two naturally occurring animal models for CEP290-related disease, both exhibiting retinal phenotypes. The rd16 mouse is a naturally occurring mutant mouse with in-frame CEP290 deletion. These mice exhibit early-onset retinal dystrophy with severely reduced ERG and abnormal retinal histology (PMID 16632484, 17554762). There is also a linage of cats, originally identified in Sweden, with late-onset recessive retinal degeneration that were found to have a CEP290 intronic variant that creates canonical splice donor site and ultimately premature protein truncation (PMID: 17507457). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for experimental evidence (6 pts.) has been reached. In summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between CEP290 and CEP290-related ciliopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This gene-disease clinical validity classification was approved by the Retina GCEP on February 3, 2022.
