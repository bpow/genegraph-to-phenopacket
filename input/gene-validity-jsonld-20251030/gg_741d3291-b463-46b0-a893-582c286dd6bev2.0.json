{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/741d3291-b463-46b0-a893-582c286dd6bev2.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"The relationship between *AGPS* and alkylglycerone-phosphate synthase deficiency (rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata 3 [RCDP3] included), an autosomal recessive peroxisomal disorder, was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of September 20, 2019 and updated by April 2022. *AGPS* encodes alkylglycerone-phosphate synthase (also known as alkyldihroxyacetonephosphate synthase, ADHAPS, alkyl-DHAP synthase), a peroxisomal enzyme catalyzing the second (last) step of plasmalogen synthesis. \n\nDeficiency of plasmalogens is a feature of RCDP. Variants in *AGPS* causing AGPS deficiency were first reported in 1998 (de Vet et al, PMID 9553082). Data from 8 patients with 9 unique variants (all missense except for one frameshift and one nonsense resulting from deletions) from six publications were curated (de Vet et al, 1998, PMID 9553082; de Vet et al, 1999, PMID 10553003; Thai et al, 2001, PMID 11152660; Itzkovitz et al, 2012, PMID 21990100; Noguchi et al, 2014, PMID 24849933, Shawi et al, 2021, PMID: 35070570). A total of 7.5 points were awarded for genetic evidence (note that this includes 2 points for a case for which the causative variant is unknown, and therefore the case could not be included in the summary matrix, but which appeared to be homozygous for a 128bp deletion in *AGPS* cDNA; PMID 10553003).\n\nThe relationship between *AGPS* and AGPS deficiency is supported by experimental evidence including the biochemical function of AGPS which is consistent with the low levels of plasmalogens observed in individuals with AGPS deficiency (Brown et al, 1982, PMID 7096336; Nagan et al, 1997, PMID 9114014); the physical interaction of alkylglycerone-phosphate synthase with glyceronephosphate O-acyltransferase (encoded by GNPAT) which catalyzes the first step of plasmalogen synthesis (Biermann et al, 1999, PMID 102158610); the finding that the activity and level glyceronephosphate O-acyltransferase is dependent on the physical presence of alkylglycerone-phosphate synthase (de Vet et al, 1999, PMID 10553003; Itzkovitz et al, PMID 21990100); the knowledge that other genes with a role in plasmalogen synthesis (GNPAT, and PEX7 which encodes the PTS2 receptor necessary for important of AGPS into the peroxisomes) are implicated in causing RCDP (Hajra et al, 1995, PMID 8685243; Braverman et al, 1997, PMID 9090381; Braverman et al, 2012, PMID 20301447); the finding of reduced levels of *AGPS* cDNA and protein in patients with AGPS deficiency (Noguchi et al, 2014, PMID 24849933); and the features of a natural and two knock-out mouse models (Liegel et al, 2011, PMID 21353609; Liegel et al, 2014, PMID 25197626). More evidence may be available but the maximum points for experimental evidence (6 points) have been reached. \n\nIn summary, *AGPS* is definitively associated with autosomal recessive AGPS deficiency. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/741d3291-b463-46b0-a893-582c286dd6be","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/aba640e2-c95d-414b-8c72-d22769e4366a","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":[{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},{"id":"cg:sopChange"},{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"},{"id":"cg:newEvidence"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/aba640e2-c95d-414b-8c72-d22769e4366a_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10049","date":"2022-04-22T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/aba640e2-c95d-414b-8c72-d22769e4366a_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10049","date":"2022-04-22T17:53:50.560Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/aba640e2-c95d-414b-8c72-d22769e4366a_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5a79e0e2-201e-4c6e-a773-9451a6eec064_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5a79e0e2-201e-4c6e-a773-9451a6eec064","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11152660","rdfs:label":"Patient 4","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":11,"allele":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4c167912-91f2-499d-b968-d08122a0d72e","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_003659.4(AGPS):c.1406T>C (p.Leu469Pro)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA118388"}},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5a763ba7-00c6-4505-a58d-054a3fe47a71","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_003659.4(AGPS):c.926C>T (p.Thr309Ile)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA118387"}}],"detectionMethod":"RT-PCR and sequence analysis of AGPS from fibroblasts.","firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypeFreeText":"Short proximal arms, bilateral cataracts, epiphyseal stippling in femoral and humeral bones.","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0002020","obo:HP_0001263","obo:HP_0000252","obo:HP_0001508"],"previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"\"Severe deficiency of plasmalogens\" (no further details).\nNo detectable AGPS (ADAPS) activity and no AGPS protein was detected in fibroblasts.","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Female","variant":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b8f645e2-6c41-48c8-a4d9-c340aacc9c90_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11152660","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4c167912-91f2-499d-b968-d08122a0d72e"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"No","zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"}},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/25dff222-30fc-497f-a59b-74e5d525d24f_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11152660","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5a763ba7-00c6-4505-a58d-054a3fe47a71"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"No","zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"}}]},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b8f645e2-6c41-48c8-a4d9-c340aacc9c90","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"This individual is compound heterozygous for two missense variants, p.Thr309Ile and p.Leu469Pro in the AGPS gene.

Biochemical and immunostaining studies had previous suggested that both of these enzymes are membrane‐bound and localized on the lumenal side of the peroxisomal membrane. In this study, both proteins were detected in a 210 kDa complex. Co-immunoprecipitation confirmed that the proteins interact in a heterotrimeric complex. This is further suported by the finding of low GNPAT activity in fibroblasts cells from a patient with a frameshift in AGPS cDNA that produced no AGPS protein, while GNPAT activity was normal in cells with AGPS deficiency caused by a missense variant but producing AGPS protein (PMID 10553003). Overall, these studies suggest that the presence of AGPS is required for GNPAT stability and function. The physical interaction between the AGPS and GNPAT gene product is further supported by the finding of low levels of GNPAT activity and/or protein in patients lacking AGPS protein (PMIDs 10553003, 11152660). Biallelic variants in GNPAT are known to cause rhizomelic chondrodyplasia punctata. The knowledge that AGPS is part of the same pathway and that the gene product interacts with that of GNPAT provides evidence that AGPS may also be involved in the pathogenesis of rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10215861","rdfs:label":"GNPAT-AGPS Coimmunoprecipitation","demonstrates":{"id":"obo:MI_0915"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/18fc4d57-4450-42e0-88e1-cf5e17def871","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/de739178-50e5-4da6-bf33-89731592a055","type":"Finding","dc:description":"In this mutant CHO cell line, deficiency of plasmalogen synthesis was shown to be caused by AGPS deficiency.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9114014","rdfs:label":"Plasmalogen biosynthesis-defective fibroblasts","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d9f8c00a-21be-4d79-861c-f5e65b564d70","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/929b3ca3-3618-4d14-baa4-b1f3638cc409","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Alkyldihydroxyacetone phosphate (alkyl-DHAP) synthase (encoded by AGPS) catalyzes the second step of plasmalogen synthesis.
