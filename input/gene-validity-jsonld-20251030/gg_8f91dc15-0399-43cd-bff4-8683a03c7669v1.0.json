Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found differences in inheritance pattern and phenotypic variability for these assertions. Therefore, these assertions have been split into the following disease entities: autosomal dominant Amyotrophic lateral Sclerosis (ALS), Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH3), Congenital Lipodystrophy (CGL3) and Familial Lipodystrophy – Type 7 (FPLD7). This curation for autosomal dominant ALS does not include probands from the other reported diseases. \nHeterozygous missense variants in coding and enhancer regions of the CAV1 gene have been reported till date in individuals with ALS (PMIDs: 33264630).  In all instances of literature when available, affected probands with CAV1 coding and CAV1/CAV2 enhancer variants are identified to have dysregulation caveolar protein expression levels (PMIDs: 33264630, 36937187, 30894019). The maximum score for genetic evidence through aggregate variant analysis is 5 (Limited 0-6). Evidence supporting this gene disease pair also includes experimental data from patient lymphoblastoid cells and iPSC derived neurons showing expression of the calveolar protein (33264630, 36937187).\n \n\n \n \n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8f91dc15-0399-43cd-bff4-8683a03c7669","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cab41529-d295-466c-8821-75a16bb12c38","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cab41529-d295-466c-8821-75a16bb12c38_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10096","date":"2023-12-21T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cab41529-d295-466c-8821-75a16bb12c38_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10096","date":"2023-12-21T18:35:45.181Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cab41529-d295-466c-8821-75a16bb12c38_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cab41529-d295-466c-8821-75a16bb12c38_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b97c1a2b-eaba-44e5-9331-528443d8e66d","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c50942fb-8c8c-497c-9dea-e1379cba54ec","type":"Finding","dc:description":"No statistically significance in expression of CAV1/2 gene was detected when comparing ALS patients to controls","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36937187","rdfs:label":"IPSC-derived MNs","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionB"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bc03dc0b-e439-4031-a55f-55ea81fd68d5","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The samples comprised of sporadic and familial ALS patients including C9orf72 and SOD1-associated ALS.
