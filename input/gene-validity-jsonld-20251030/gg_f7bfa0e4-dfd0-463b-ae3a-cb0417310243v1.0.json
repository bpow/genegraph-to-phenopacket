At least 11 unique variants (missense, nonsense) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 8 probands in 5 publications (PMIDs: 18674751, 26092869, 25138100, 27894351, 29255182). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 4 additional family members. The mechanism for disease is homozygous loss of function. This gene-disease association is supported by animal models, rescue experiments, expression studies, and in vitro functional assays. In summary, ARL13B is definitively associated with autosomal recessive Joubert syndrome. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Syndromic Disorders GCEP on 6.3.2020 (SOP Version 7).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f7bfa0e4-dfd0-463b-ae3a-cb0417310243","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f6c474c9-4035-498c-a902-03be50d36205","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f6c474c9-4035-498c-a902-03be50d36205_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10060","date":"2020-09-16T19:23:31.526Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f6c474c9-4035-498c-a902-03be50d36205_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10060","date":"2020-06-03T21:01:14.719Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f6c474c9-4035-498c-a902-03be50d36205_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f6c474c9-4035-498c-a902-03be50d36205_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bff15292-95f9-4988-9235-e74b442fcca6","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The phenotype does not exactly match the patient phenotype.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6a49a0c1-b804-4988-8215-2cb1b583511f","type":"Finding","dc:description":"The mouse is characterized by neural tube defects such as exencephaly and spina bifida, polydactyly, and nodal cilia are shortened.
