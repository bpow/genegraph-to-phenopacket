At least 3 variants (missense, intronic) have been reported in\nhumans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship\nincludes case-level data and\nexperimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 3 probands in 3 publications (PMIDs 24847004, 27940755, 29388319). This gene-disease association is supported by \nanimal models and expression studies (PMIDs 23212377, 28923496, 35796562). In summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged. This gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the Fatty Acid Oxidation Disorders GCEP on May 8, 2018. It was reevaluated on May 29, 2025. As a result of this reevaluation, the classification did not change.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/062e386c-ea41-4d13-8d3b-2334fa4a5bc9","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/285bdfcd-10c2-48f9-9be9-d77894b26f19","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","changes":[{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"},{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},{"id":"cg:newEvidence"},{"id":"cg:sopChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/285bdfcd-10c2-48f9-9be9-d77894b26f19_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10010","date":"2025-05-30T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/285bdfcd-10c2-48f9-9be9-d77894b26f19_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10010","date":"2025-05-31T03:02:08.748Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["RecurationTiming"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/285bdfcd-10c2-48f9-9be9-d77894b26f19_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ac26598d-869a-4963-95d0-efdc753f4158_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ac26598d-869a-4963-95d0-efdc753f4158","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27940755","rdfs:label":"Tort 2016 Patient","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":10,"allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c36a8c5a-4d8d-4ac9-809f-fcb50ffd5572","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001085411.3(NADK2):c.956+6T>C (p.=)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA658682656"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"Prenatal CNS dysgenesia, increased pipecolic acid, deficiency of mitchondrial respiratory chain complexes III and IV.
