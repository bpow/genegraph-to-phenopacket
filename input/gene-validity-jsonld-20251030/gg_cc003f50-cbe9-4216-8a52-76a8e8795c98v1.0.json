The *SDHAF1* gene encodes succinate dehydrogenase (complex II) assembly factor 1. Defects of this protein have been associated with autosomal recessive complex II deficiency.\n\nThe *SDHAF1* gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive primary mitochondrial disease in 2009 (PMID: 19465911), in one family with features consistent with Leigh syndrome spectrum (LSS) and in another family with leukoencephalopathy. While various names have been given to the constellation of features seen in those with *SDHAF1*-related disease, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *SDHAF1* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework. Of note, *SDHAF1* was previously curated by this GCEP on January 13, 2020 (SOP Version 7) as having a limited association with LSS. The scope of this current curation encompassed cases of primary mitochondrial disease, which includes LSS.  \n\nEvidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included six unique variants (three missense, three stop-gained variants) from four publications (PMIDs: 19465911, 22995659, 31130284, 26642834). In addition to LSS and leukoencephalopathy, affected individuals also had spastic paraplegia, dystonia, failure to thrive, and sensorineural hearing loss. Muscle biopsies showed complex II deficiency.\n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by a biochemical function shared with other genes associated with primary mitochondrial disease, yeast knockdown showing complex II deficiency, and rescue of complex II activity in patient cells by wild-type protein (PMIDs: 19465911, 26749241, 33162331).\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support this gene-disease relationship, including that more than three years have elapsed since the first proposal of the association. This relationship has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. No convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on December 4, 2023 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cc003f50-cbe9-4216-8a52-76a8e8795c98","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e421e4d0-9618-4fad-bf20-a509d8d527ed","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e421e4d0-9618-4fad-bf20-a509d8d527ed_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2023-12-04T05:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e421e4d0-9618-4fad-bf20-a509d8d527ed_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2024-01-22T16:24:38.887Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e421e4d0-9618-4fad-bf20-a509d8d527ed_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e421e4d0-9618-4fad-bf20-a509d8d527ed_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/aad07df2-f4c7-4b73-8a49-e4744c28dc76","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"reduced points for yeast model","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/203a04ab-e28f-4c7a-9900-84df6a1fe1e6","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Specific reduction of complex II activity","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19465911","rdfs:label":"Yeast model","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/09dfc758-b39c-47eb-aa28-905e6408ec15","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/00a12a58-ad9b-4797-be9e-c109597ece00","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Expressed wild-type human SDHAF1 in three G57R mutant fibroblast cell lines.

Other typical findings were involvement of the cerebral hemispheric white matter with sparing of the U fibers, the corpus callosum with sparing of the outer blades, the basis pontis, middle cerebellar peduncles and cerebellar white matter, and elevated succinate on MRS. The thalamus was involved in most studies with a predilection for the anterior nucleus, pulvinar and geniculate bodies. Clinically, infantile-onset neurological regression with partial recovery and subsequent stabilization was typical.\nStep-wise deterioration.\tWalking at 10 months, talking at 10 months\tSpastic tetraparesis, moderate intellectual impairment, modest recovery from complete aphasia.\n","previousTesting":false,"sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/98dc1f47-e2e9-4616-b19c-31ba7786160d_variant_evidence_item"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria","strengthScore":3.0},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/aaaa3aef-23e1-4cb6-98ad-924c3f3d10c9_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c9068e8e-9bab-4499-bf60-61f0caf0f5ae","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":3.0,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c9068e8e-9bab-4499-bf60-61f0caf0f5ae_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31130284","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f22433fe-6c9d-4c42-b98f-b13e069bd65e","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001042631.3(SDHAF1):c.28C>T (p.Gln10Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA405422832"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":3.0},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/aaaa3aef-23e1-4cb6-98ad-924c3f3d10c9","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31130284","rdfs:label":"17-3320","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":21,"allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f22433fe-6c9d-4c42-b98f-b13e069bd65e"},"detectionMethod":"Trio WES","firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"Developmental regression","previousTesting":false,"sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c9068e8e-9bab-4499-bf60-61f0caf0f5ae_variant_evidence_item"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria","strengthScore":3.0}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":7615,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria10","strengthScore":15,"subject":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/nfXjwauZWlo","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0044970","gene":"hgnc:33867","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","websiteLegacyID":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/assertion_e421e4d0-9618-4fad-bf20-a509d8d527ed-","@context":{"@vocab":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"},"curationReasons":{"@type":"@vocab","@container":"@set"},"GCISnapshot":{"@type":"@id"},"dc:isVersionOf":{"@type":"@id"},"websiteLegacyID":{"@type":"@id"}}}
