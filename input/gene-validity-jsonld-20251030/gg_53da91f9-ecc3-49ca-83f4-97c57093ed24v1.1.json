Variable expressivity, age of ascertainment, and outdated clinical assessments of affected individuals may complicate the clinical diagnosis of CFC versus other SOS1-RASopathies. The patients presented in these studies did not have convincing features described and/or there were not strong assertions made to diagnose these individuals with CFC. Therefore, the cases were not scored and the association has been classified as Disputed. Of note, SOS1 has also been classified as definitive in association with Noonan syndrome (NS) and as disputed in association with Costello syndrome. The ClinGen RASopathy Expert Panel found no evidence associating SOS1 with either NS with loose anagen hair or NS with multiple lentigines. This curation was approved by the ClinGen RASopathy Gene Curation Expert Panel on 6/1/18 (SOP Version 5).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/53da91f9-ecc3-49ca-83f4-97c57093ed24","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ee5b916f-82ef-4738-82c8-46ee2fad131b","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"NoKnownDiseaseRelationship","changes":{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ee5b916f-82ef-4738-82c8-46ee2fad131b_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10021","date":"2021-03-04T20:53:21.546Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ee5b916f-82ef-4738-82c8-46ee2fad131b_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10021","date":"2018-06-01T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"no scorable cases.","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ee5b916f-82ef-4738-82c8-46ee2fad131b_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ee5b916f-82ef-4738-82c8-46ee2fad131b_ad_other_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/978beb92-e693-4bdd-9af0-96bad7f9ca06_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Variant functionally characterized by Roberts et al. 2007 (17143285).
