{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/93c0da11-a14e-4c09-b7a0-4c8a52bdca1av1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"The relationship between POLG and Leigh syndrome spectrum (LSS) was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of March 23, 2020. The POLG gene encodes the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase gamma, the only DNA polymerase in humans that replicates and repairs mitochondrial DNA.\n\nThe POLG gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Leigh syndrome spectrum in 2009 (variants reported in PMID: 18828154; this case was first reported in 1996 in PMID: 9566823 with further details provided in 2002 in PMID: 12004863). Pathogenic variants in POLG are more commonly associated with a range of other clinical syndromes such as Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome, childhood myocerebrohepatopathy spectrum (MCHS), myoclonic epilepsy myopathy sensory ataxia syndrome (MEMSA), ataxia neuropathy spectrum (ANS), and progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO). Of note, many cases in the literature were reviewed to look for evidence of LSS. Several additional cases were considered but were ultimately excluded as features were more consistent with Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome than LSS. Evidence supporting the gene-disease relationship between POLG and LSS includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included two variants identified in one case in one publication (PMID: 18828154). No segregation data were available. Loss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease association is also supported by biochemical function, expression data, functional alteration in patient cells, and animal models (PMIDs: 16464011, 25613900, 16957900, 26519465). \n\nIn summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on March 23, 2020 (SOP Version 7).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/93c0da11-a14e-4c09-b7a0-4c8a52bdca1a","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1212393e-b517-4430-a8d7-df7e32295aff","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1212393e-b517-4430-a8d7-df7e32295aff_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2021-06-30T14:50:05.072Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1212393e-b517-4430-a8d7-df7e32295aff_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2021-06-30T14:49:55.983Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1212393e-b517-4430-a8d7-df7e32295aff_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1212393e-b517-4430-a8d7-df7e32295aff_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/58f5bfd0-ee8a-4748-8b2f-1f79d08caafc","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Utilized the U24 NICD Leigh Working group animal model scoring rubric (1 pt for phenotype evidence and 1 pt for biochemical evidence)","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/16d2dc75-9b47-46f0-b213-760ec858662a","type":"Finding","dc:description":"The POLG mutant zebrafish showed a phenotype similar to humans with POLG mutations in that they had delayed development and early mortality.
