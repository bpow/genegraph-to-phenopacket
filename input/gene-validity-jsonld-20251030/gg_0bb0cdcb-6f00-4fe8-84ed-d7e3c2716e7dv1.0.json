Variants in this gene, which encodes a cell surface calcium-permeable cation channel, have been associated with several disorders including skeletal dysplasias (Brachyolmia, Metatropic dysplasia, etc.), motor-neuropathies (congenital/scapuloperoneal spinal muscle atrophy), and a motor-sensory neuropathy (Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease). As the latter two groups are generally considered a spectrum of disease with variable severity (Toft-Bertelsen and MacAulay, PMID: 33467654), these entities have been evaluated together for the purposes of this curation. The skeletal dysplasias will be evaluated separately. At least fifteen unique variants, usually missense, have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data.\nVariants in this gene have been reported in at least eighteen probands in five publications (PMIDs: 20037586, 20037588, 27066566, 20460441, 25900305). Variants in this gene also segregated with the disorder in over twenty-five additional family members, the majority of which were confirmed via whole exome sequencing. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism for disease is gain-of-function, typically with the mutant incorporating with the wild-type into tetrameric channels and causing variable trafficking modifications. TRPV4 variants do not show any significant genotype-phenotype correlation, with the harboring domain bearing little relation to the resulting phenotypic entity (Toft-Bertelsen and MacAulay). \nThis gene-disease association is additionally supported by a limited amount of experimental evidence. Functional evidence demonstrates that neuropathy mutants disrupt TRPV4's interaction with the GTPase RhoA, as there is a striking reduction of wildtype TRPV4-RhoA interaction when in a tetramer with the neuropathy mutants and no effect with dysplasia mutants (McCray et al., PMID: 33664271). The mild phenotype of TRPV4-null mice and undesirable side effects of TRPV4 inhibitors limit the usefulness of traditional animal models, however there have been several that elucidate some amount of evidence towards the gene's pathogenicity (Everaerts et al., PMID: 20956320). Both a roundworm and drosophila model have been characterized, with the drosophila model utilizing a common neuropathy variant p.Arg269Cys that resulted in variable neuronal and muscular defects. Notably, these effects could be suppressed via TRPV4 inhibitors or ion-channel disruption, indicating a dose-dependent toxic gain-of-function that matched the human probands (Woolums et al., PMID: 32471994).\nIn summary, TRPV4 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant neuromuscular disease. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0bb0cdcb-6f00-4fe8-84ed-d7e3c2716e7d","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b89b03c3-24c7-4424-989c-abd65eb2b7ec","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b89b03c3-24c7-4424-989c-abd65eb2b7ec_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10063","date":"2021-12-14T14:53:10.482Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b89b03c3-24c7-4424-989c-abd65eb2b7ec_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10063","date":"2021-12-14T14:53:28.438Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b89b03c3-24c7-4424-989c-abd65eb2b7ec_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b89b03c3-24c7-4424-989c-abd65eb2b7ec_ad_dn_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b507b37f-7b09-4da0-a364-500df03c3db1_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Confirmed de novo missense w/ variant-level evidence (Studies have shown that this missense change results in constitutive activation of the TRPV4 channel; PMIDs: 18587396, 21573172, 20037588)","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/14a03d5a-61be-4115-bb43-0ce01ac8c7c1","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20460441","rdfs:label":"ZI_PN-1394.1","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":6,"detectionMethod":"Genomic DNA from total blood was obtained from patients and amplified via PCR.

The R269C flies showed inability to expand their wings after eclosion, indicating a neuronal and muscular defect. This was not observed in either of the other two lines, with the co-expression of both R269C and R269C+M680K suppressing the phenotype due to the tetrameric ion channel structure. Expressing the R269C variant later in life also impacted climbing performance, compared to the other two which showed no detrimental effects. The R269C flies showed marked loss of axonal projections and dendritic arborizations compared to the other two lines, indicating neuronal degeneration similar to that in human probands. Investigation revealed that this resulted from impaired development and toxicity in a dose-dependent manner consistent with a gain-of-function mechanism. A TRPV4 antagonist, GSK219, suppressed the neurodegeneration phenotype further supporting TRPV4 as the phenotypic mediator. Further testing identified a potent genetic modifier, CaMKII, that could ameliorate the wing phenotype when knocked out or enhance it when overexpressed in flies. This relationship influences the N_CCAP in Drosophilia, producing hyperexcitability dependent on the intracellular Ca2+ levels. Studies on neurons with R269C demonstrated an increased Ca2+ response than WT in response to agonist stimulation and spontaneous calcium transients, indicating that this mutation sensitizes the channels consistent with the gain-of-function mechanism predicted. Mitochondrial transport was also affected, with the R269C flies showing inhibited axonal transport and resulting stationary anterograde and retrograde mitochondria.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32471994","rdfs:label":"TRPV4 Drosophilia Model","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b89b03c3-24c7-4424-989c-abd65eb2b7ec_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a0a9c1af-2fb8-422a-bdd4-2b6996043c65","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/dfc9a4f3-393f-4063-be7b-b0948b3e08cd","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Following initial studies suggesting that TRPV4 had an enriched role with the small GTPase RhoA, the interaction between them was confirmed via co-immunoprecipitation.
