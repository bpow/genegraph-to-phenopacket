Homozygous activating mutations involving Cysteine residues in β3 have also been reported, but with a normal platelet count and volume.

The variant was found to be inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern in the patients' respective families. Haplotype analysis of the two patients suggested a possible common ancestor and thus a founder effect. The variant is not reported in gnomAD. The variant occurs in intron 13 and disrupts the splice donor site. Upon RT-PCR and sequencing analysis, it was found that the variant resulted in an in-frame deletion of 120 bp of exon 13, with loss of 40 residues of the extracellular βTD subdomain of integrin β3 (p.D647_E686del of the mature polypeptide). Real-time PCR was used to quantify normal β3 mRNA, which revealed 50% reduction in the proband. Mutated β3 mRNA was also expressed in the proband's platelets, suggesting a dominant negative effect of the mutant on the expression of normal β3 leading to impaired αIIbβ3-mediated outside-in signaling observed in the patients. Fg and PAC-1 binding to resting platelets was slightly enhanced. Spreading on Fg was severely impaired (up to 50% platelets failed to spread compared to control).

Confocal microscopy revealed internalization of the receptor, while normal β3-expressing cells were localized on the cell surface. Similar to patient platelets (carrying the c.2134+1G>C variant), variant-expressing CHO cells showed higher fraction of internalized αIIbβ3 and fibrinogen internalization in resting state. In addition, variant-expressing CHO cells spread faster on fibrinogen than wild-type. Similarly, patient platelets initially spread faster but after 30 min became defective. Constitutive phosphorylation of integrin β3 Tyr773 and Tyr785, and focal adhesion kinase was observed in variant-CHO cells and resting patients’ platelets but not in control platelets. Clot retraction was also reduced in variant-CHO cells and patient platelets.\n\nPolymerized actin (F-actin) content of variant β3-CHO cells with normal αIIb was higher than that of normal-CHO cells, and it did not increase after stimulation with DTT. Similarly, cytoskeletal protein content in resting patients’ platelets was higher than that in resting control platelets. \n\nTreatment of control platelets with jasplakinolide, which induces actin polymerization and stabilizes actin filaments, impaired ADP- induced αIIbβ3 activation, platelet aggregation, clot retraction and spreading on Fg, effectively resembling patients’ platelets. \n\nVariant-β3-transduced megakaryocytes showed reduced proplatelet number and larger tip diameter, significantly more asymmetrical barbell-proplatelets, and abnormal spreading on Fg, similar to that seen in patients. \n\nThe authors conclude that the perturbed actin polymerization impairs proplatelet formation, as evidenced by experiments with jasplakinolide-treated human megakaryocytes which showed impaired adhesion to Fg and spreading.  \n\nNote: The supplementary material refers to the previously pblished variants as S526F, L743P and D748H.
