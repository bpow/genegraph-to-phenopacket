At least 16 unique variants (missense, nonsense, splicing, and frameshift) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 18 probands in 3 publications (PMID: 12192640, 16779558, 21670436). The mechanism of disease is homozygous loss of function. This gene-disease association is supported by animal models. In summary, SEPN1 (SELENON) is definitively associated with autosomal recessive SELENON-related myopathy.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f367d03a-af8d-4e95-80a7-e69e3e3e2999","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7485529e-a573-4a47-aa0f-7c0d7067ae49","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7485529e-a573-4a47-aa0f-7c0d7067ae49_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10031","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7485529e-a573-4a47-aa0f-7c0d7067ae49_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10031","date":"2020-04-27T19:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7485529e-a573-4a47-aa0f-7c0d7067ae49_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1917fc12-ddf3-4bc1-ad75-b6bdbec39a78_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Downgraded due to consanguinity.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/266ad91f-6c3d-4073-a249-ed34c73d8a14","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12192640","rdfs:label":"F1 Male","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":18,"detectionMethod":"Whole-genome screening was performed using a 400-microsatellite marker set with an average spacing of 10cM.
