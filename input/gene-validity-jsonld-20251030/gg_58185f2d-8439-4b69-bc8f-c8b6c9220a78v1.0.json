The COX8A gene encodes cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV) subunit 8A. Defects of this protein lead to complex IV deficiency.\n\nThe COX8A gene has been reported only once in relation to autosomal recessive Leigh syndrome spectrum, in 2016 (PMID: 26685157), and this has been the only case reported to date. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included one homozygous variant identified in one case in one publication (PMID: 26685157). No segregation data were available. Loss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease association is also supported by biochemical function, expression, and rescue in patient cells (PMIDs: 27977873, 25613900, 26685157).\n\nIn summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on June 8, 2020 (SOP Version 7).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/58185f2d-8439-4b69-bc8f-c8b6c9220a78","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/70763eb9-40f7-4f71-a64b-ab0c6ad536b0","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/70763eb9-40f7-4f71-a64b-ab0c6ad536b0_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2021-04-09T13:55:22.310Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/70763eb9-40f7-4f71-a64b-ab0c6ad536b0_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2021-04-09T13:55:10.592Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/70763eb9-40f7-4f71-a64b-ab0c6ad536b0_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/70763eb9-40f7-4f71-a64b-ab0c6ad536b0_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0d3a4097-fcc6-4fbb-9694-766bfc65f2c5","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4e7c542d-630e-4cf6-b6f6-8debac9f37d7","type":"Finding","dc:description":"To verify the causative role of the loss of COX8A in the observed isolated COX deficiency, used a lentiviral system in the patient’s fibroblasts to express the wild-type COX8A protein C-terminally tagged with myc-DDK. At maximal virus load, a ~60% transduction efficiency was observed, as estimated by DDK immunoreactivity. Opposite to the sample transfected with the empty virus (Fig. 4D), in the COX8A-transduced sample, a high proportion of fibroblasts showed a typical mitochondrial pattern of MT-CO1 immunoreactivity (Fig. 4G), and this co-localized with the NDUFS5 (complex I) signal (Fig. 4H). The proportion of MT-CO1 immunoreactive fibroblasts strongly correlated with that of DDK-positive fibroblasts in different experiments with varying virus amounts (Fig. 4B). In functional activity assays on fibroblast homogenates, viral expression of COX8A caused a substantial increase of COX activity reaching almost 67% of the control activity and correlated with the percentage of transduced cells and the percentage of MT-CO1 immunoreactive cells (Fig. 4B).","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26685157","rdfs:label":"Hallmann 1","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:PhenotypeRescue"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellRescueCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/70763eb9-40f7-4f71-a64b-ab0c6ad536b0_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3b2ea175-f442-43ff-b1c6-345955e7a025","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Score increased in accordance with internal guidelines","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/60ca6ba3-df74-41de-9233-9b9366193593","type":"Finding","dc:description":"COX8A is one of the four subunits of Complex IV.

Uneventful pregnancy, normal delivery at normal GA. Congenital scoliosis with thoracolumbar kyphosis and bilateral pes planovalgus were present at birth. Primary developmental delay and primary pulmonary hypertension were diagnosed at the age of 6 months. At the age of 4–5 years, a cachectic appearance with malnutrition and recurrent vomiting was evident, and a percutaneous gastrointestinal feeding tube was inserted. At the age of 8 years, the girl presented with a febrile state due to pneumonia and urinary tract infection, which resulted in the first manifestation of focal and generalized epileptic tonic-clonic seizures and a severe metabolic crisis with lactic acidosis. Further clinical phenotyping and diagnostic procedures showed serious psychomotor retardation, a short stature, microcephalus, enophthalmus, proximal muscular hypotonia, distal spasticity of upper and lower limbs, weak deep tendon reflexes, and absent extensor plantar responses. At the age of 10 years, a dislocation of both hips was diagnosed. Meanwhile, the patient was non-ambulatory and wheelchairbound. Her severe epilepsy presented with tonic-clonic, myoclonic, and atonic seizures and only partly responded to various antiepileptic drug treatment regimens including levetiracetam, oxcarbazepine, and sultiame. Pneumonia with sepsis manifested at the age of 12 years resulting in a serious metabolic crisis and cardiorespiratory failure. The patient died after several weeks of intensive care unit treatment after unsuccessful cardiopulmonary resuscitation at the age of 12.5 years. Diagnostic work-up at the age of 8 years showed pathological EEG changes with generalized slowing and continuous multifocal spike-and-wave activity. Elevated lactate levels were present in the CSF (max. 11.4 mmol/l, normal values <2) and peripheral blood (max. 6.2 mmol/l, normal values <1.6). Metabolic screening of the urine and CSF showed elevated lactate and citric acid cycle metabolite levels, as well as increased glycine and alanine levels. Ophthalmological examinations detected a pigmentary retinopathy. \nBrain MRI at the age of 8 years (Fig. 1A) showed a leftsided small lacunar thalamic lesion without further basal ganglia or cortical signal alterations, signal hyperintensities in T2-weighted sequences in the right cerebellar hemisphere. Diffusion-weighted imaging revealed extensive and symmetric areas of restricted diffusion in the white matter that were first interpreted as encephalitis or metabolic encephalopathy.A subsequent brain MRI at the age of 12 years (Fig. 1B) showed a progressive and extent atrophy especially of the white matter with white matter signal changes in T2-weighted sequences that were most pronounced in periventricular areas, cerebellar hemispheres, and parietooccipital lobes. A consecutive biventricular ex vacuo enlargement and cystic defects with parietooccipital predominance were also detected.","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fcc4b226-a9c0-4587-8397-0eea1cc5ed88_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26685157","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0e4516f2-f9ce-449e-a1ef-366eb886a16f","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_004074.3(COX8A):c.115-1G>C","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA352165"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"}}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"evidenceStrength":"Limited","sequence":2509,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria7","strengthScore":4.5,"subject":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/TOqJy8Fsv9A","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0009723","gene":"hgnc:2294","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","websiteLegacyID":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/assertion_70763eb9-40f7-4f71-a64b-ab0c6ad536b0-","@context":{"@vocab":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"},"curationReasons":{"@type":"@vocab","@container":"@set"},"GCISnapshot":{"@type":"@id"},"dc:isVersionOf":{"@type":"@id"},"websiteLegacyID":{"@type":"@id"}}}
