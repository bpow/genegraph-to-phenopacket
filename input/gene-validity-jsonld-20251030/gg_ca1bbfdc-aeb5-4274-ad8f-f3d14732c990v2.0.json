The disease was first described by Ghadimi et al in 1961, who observed elevated levels of histidine in blood and urine of two patients. This metabolic disorder seems to be benign in most affected individuals, although, under unusual circumstances, the disorder may be harmful and produce the central nervous system disease noted in a few histidinemic patients (Reviewed in Levy H., Histidinemia. Orphanet encyclopedia, May 2002). HAL catalyzes the reaction: L-histidine = urocanate + NH3; in patients with deficiency of HAL there is a consequent accumulation of histidine and decreased concentration of urocanate. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Biallelic missense variants in this gene have been reported in at least 1 proband in 1 publication (PMID: 15806399). At least 7 additional variants (splice site, nonsense, missense, and frameshift) have been associated with mildly increased histidine levels in the heterozygous state (PMIDs: 25575548, 27453504, 26990548). This gene-disease relationship is supported by the biochemical function of HAL which is consistent with the biochemical abnormalities observed in individuals with histidinemia (Takeuchi, J. Biochem., Japan, 34, 1 (1941)), the functional alteration in patient cells (PMID: 7211776) and the biochemical features of a histidinemic mouse (PMID: 8486363). In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged.\n\nThis gene-disease pair was previously evaluated by the Aminoacidopathy GCEP on 09/25/2020. It was reevaluated on 10/24/2023. As a result of this reevaluation, the classification remained Limited with no new evidence identified.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ca1bbfdc-aeb5-4274-ad8f-f3d14732c990","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c5764eb8-2aad-419e-be57-99f8c6859ebb","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","changes":[{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"},{"id":"cg:sopChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c5764eb8-2aad-419e-be57-99f8c6859ebb_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10011","date":"2023-11-17T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c5764eb8-2aad-419e-be57-99f8c6859ebb_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10011","date":"2023-12-08T17:41:08.298Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["RecurationTiming"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c5764eb8-2aad-419e-be57-99f8c6859ebb_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/00be02e3-94da-4296-90ee-a5737ce59edf_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/00be02e3-94da-4296-90ee-a5737ce59edf","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15806399","rdfs:label":"Patient 3","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Days","ageValue":1,"allele":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9563ed34-d282-4d45-ac6e-1f05db40762f","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_002108.4(HAL):c.965G>C (p.Arg322Pro)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA115146"}},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6f784bdd-1362-42d8-8bc0-fe0452c68165","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_002108.4(HAL):c.776_777delinsTG (p.Pro259Leu)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA1139532293"}}],"detectionMethod":"Exons 1–21 and the flanking sequences of the histidase gene were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and screened for the presence of small mutations.
