Two unique missense variants were reported in this publication. The pathogenicity of one variant was supported by functional studies in a cell culture model system that showed mutant protein fragments accumulated in the cytoplasm and failed to bind to actin filaments. This variant also segregated with disease in 2 additional family members. The second variant reported by Wang et al. was found at a high frequency in the gnomAD database, which is consistent with benign variation. The mechanism for disease is unknown. This gene-disease relationship is supported by expression studies (Hassel et al, 2009, PMID 1988149; Fagerberg et al, 2013, PMID 24309898) and localization of NEXN to the intercalated disk (Hassel et al, 2009, PMID 1988149), and interaction with alpha actin (Wang et al, PMID 20970104). In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. The relationship between *NEXN *and autosomal dominant hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was originally evaluated by the ClinGen Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Gene Curation Expert Panel (GCEP) on October 28, 2016 and found to have a limited classification. It was re-evaluated on March 23, 2023 by the Hereditary Cardiovascular Disease GCEP. As a result of this recuration, the classification has not changed, and remains limited.\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/12f1ab44-a7ce-4416-a33e-1066a3754cb8","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9456bdef-7708-45b2-a698-c897167d7f5b","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","changes":[{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"},{"id":"cg:sopChange"},{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},{"id":"cg:newEvidence"},{"id":"cg:expertPanelChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9456bdef-7708-45b2-a698-c897167d7f5b_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10104","date":"2023-04-12T22:21:03.278Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9456bdef-7708-45b2-a698-c897167d7f5b_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10104","date":"2023-03-23T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9456bdef-7708-45b2-a698-c897167d7f5b_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9456bdef-7708-45b2-a698-c897167d7f5b_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8f5af859-50e7-4cf8-940c-391a9a625ab5","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Scored 0 points because 0.5 points already given to Hassel paper, which also provided expression evidence through RNA sequencing experiment.
