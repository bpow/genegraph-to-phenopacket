{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0b2ab686-55cb-47d2-b8d0-c5ded2cdf835v1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"JPH2 was first reported in relation to dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) in 2016 (Sabater-Molina et al., 2016, PMID 27471098). \nPreviously, JPH2 was curated for a semi-dominant mode of inheritance in DCM as evidence existed for both a dominant and recessive disease mechanism (curated 10/09/2020). The gene has now been curated separately for dominant disease here. \nThe JPH2 gene encodes Junctophilin 2, a component of the junctional membrane complex (T-tubular and sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) membranes) that is involved in excitation-contraction coupling (also known as Ca2+ induced Ca2+ release. In humans 4 junctophilin (JPH) genes are present. JPH2 is the predominant isoform in the heart (Takeshima et al., 2000, PMID 10949023). \nHuman genetic evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes limited case-level data and segregation data. At least 7 rare missense variants, and a single promoter/exonic deletion of JPH2 have been observed in humans affected with (Hazebroek et al 2018, PMID: 29540472; van Lint et al 2019, PMID: 30847666; Lian et al 2023, PMID: 37461109; Lesurf et al 2022, PMID: 35288587) Limited co-segregation with disease was observed in a single family with DCM and a JPH2 missense variant (Sabater-Molina et al., 2016, PMID 27471098). Of note, beyond a single case (Lesurf et al) there are no reports of heterozygotes for variants predicted to cause haploinsufficiency being affected with DCM.\nIn addition, this gene-disease assertion is supported by animal models. A DCM mouse model (MLPKO mice) showed an approximately 40% decreased JPH2 protein (but not mRNA) expression in left ventricular tissue (Minamisawa et al., 2004, PMID 15541368). Several JPH2 knock-out/down mice models have been made. A conventional knockout (KO) of the endogenous gene induced embryonic lethality and KO-cardiomyocytes show no rhythmic contraction and infirm Ca2+ transients (Takeshima et al., 2000, PMID 10949023). In an inducible JPH2 knockdown mouse model (using tamoxifen inducible cardiac-specific short-hairpin-RNA-mediated JPH2 knockdown), adult male tamoxifen-treated mice showed increased mortality and dilated cardiomyopathy. A cross of these mice with a JPH2-overexpression mouse also demonstrated phenotype recue due to JPH2 over-expression (van Oort et al., 2011, PMID 21339484). Another JPH2 knockdown mouse model (using cardiac-specific short-hairpin-RNA-mediated JPH2 knockdown; alphaMHCshJPH2) developed heart failure marked by reduced ejection fraction, ventricular dilation, and premature death (Reynolds et al., 2013, PMID 23715556). Finally, two Drosophila models in which JPH is overexpressed (UAS–jp) or knocked down (UAS-jpRNAi) using the Gal4/UAS system resulted in reduced survival and a DCM like phenotype (increased end-systolic (ESD), end-diastolic diameter (EDD) and decreased fractional shortening (FS)) without evidence for cardiac hypertrophy (Calpena et al., 2018, PMID 29208631). \nIn summary, there is limited evidence to support a dominant model of disease for this gene-disease relationship. Further evidence over time is needed to establish the relationship of JPH2 with dominant DCM. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Dilated Cardiomyopathy Working Group on January 24, 2025 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0b2ab686-55cb-47d2-b8d0-c5ded2cdf835","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8d310e47-1f84-4c61-b06a-b273a4b1b601","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8d310e47-1f84-4c61-b06a-b273a4b1b601_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10035","date":"2025-07-31T18:08:14.767Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8d310e47-1f84-4c61-b06a-b273a4b1b601_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10035","date":"2025-01-24T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"Variant score of 6.2 falls between moderate and limited; DCM GCEP rounded down to limited classification for JPH2 with AD inheritance","curationReasons":["RecurationTiming"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8d310e47-1f84-4c61-b06a-b273a4b1b601_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8d310e47-1f84-4c61-b06a-b273a4b1b601_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a4e7b306-85a0-47c6-bf57-436108447d7d","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4f6100ba-6436-46b7-9d71-4667263b9a99","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Three to five month old male MCM, MCM-shJPH2 and MCMshJPH2-OE mice were treated with daily 100 μl tamoxifen (30mg/kg) for 5 consecutive days.\nWestern blot analysis of cardiac protein lysates demonstrated that knockdown of JPH2 mRNA resulted in a 60% reduction in JPH2 protein (Figure 1B).\nWithin 1 week after tamoxifen injections, mortality was 40% among MCM-shJPH2 mice compared with 0% among MCM mice (P=0.004).\nFurthermore, end-systolic diameter and end-diastolic diameter were both significantly larger.\nLeft ventricular posterior wall thickness did not change between MCM-shJPH2 (0.800.03 mm) and MCM controls and no difference in cardiomyocyte cross-sectional areas between MCM-shJPH2 mice and MCM controls. => DCM phenotype","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21339484","rdfs:label":"Inducible JPH2 knockdown mice","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9a697adc-2d42-4653-b73e-1be1dc0c71c0","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/947740f4-b707-422c-a69e-794f7dc2abb9","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Mean survival was reduced from 47 days in control flies to 27 days in OE flies and only 17 days in KD flies.\nCardiac chamber parameters for both OE en KD (fig 3):\nIncreased end-systolic diameter (ESD) and end-diastolic diameter (EDD).\nDecreased fractional shortening (FS) =>DCM phenotype.\nSections show that the thickness of the heart wall in the mutant flies does not show any statistically significant difference from control flies, discounting hypertrophy of cardiomyocytes (Fig. 3E).\nThe cardiac fibers in the mutant flies were clearly more disorganized and less compact than in control flies.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29208631","rdfs:label":"JPH overexpression and knockdown Drosophila model","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8b5f963b-eaa6-48a5-98fc-796076ed3cdd","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"no DCM phenotype (heart not yet properly formed)","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/433e1779-9afb-4eca-997e-44293f7108a9","type":"Finding","dc:description":"DCM phenotype in the model is not clear because embryos died before the heart was properly formed","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15541368","rdfs:label":"JP2 knockout mice","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":0},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/72a38ddf-d22c-4073-97ea-5ed9e1e480b4","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"because already scored in van Oort et al., 2011","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7151c41f-7d49-4a99-9d73-07903119716f","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Robust and specific expression of the mature JPH2 siRNA was detected in cardiac tissue from aMHC-shJPH2 mice as early as E10.5.
