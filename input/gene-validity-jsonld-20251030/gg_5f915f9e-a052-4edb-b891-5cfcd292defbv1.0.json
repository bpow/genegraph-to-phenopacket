The *COX4I1* gene encodes an isoform of a subunit of cytochrome *c* oxidase (COX) that is more ubiquitously expressed than its other isoform *COX4I2*.\n\n*COX4I1* was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive primary mitochondrial disease in 2017 (PMID: 28766551) in a child from consanguineous parents with short stature, failure to thrive, normal development, and chromosome breakage studies overlapping with Fanconi anemia. Given the functional studies performed in this report (including COX deficiency on respiratory chain analysis with complementation studies), this Expert Panel elected to include this report in this current curation but noted that the Fanconi anemia phenotype is not typical of primary mitochondrial disorders. While various names have been given to the constellation of features seen in those with *COX4I1*-related disease, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *COX4I1* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework. Of note, *COX4I1* was first curated by this Expert Panel for its association with Leigh syndrome spectrum (LSS) on December 16, 2020 (SOP V7), with a final classification of Limited. This current curation for the association with primary mitochondrial disease includes the single case included in the LSS curation.\n\nEvidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This included two homozygous variants, one missense, and one indel with functional evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction (c.303_304delinsTT; p.Lys101_Thr102delinsAsnSer). In addition to the case with Fanconi anemia, there is a case report of an infant with Leigh syndrome spectrum disorder (PMID: 31290619).\n\nThe mechanism of disease is loss of function. This gene-disease association is also supported by the known biochemical function of COX4I1 as a subunit of complex IV, as well as functional alteration in non-patient cells (PMIDs: 33672589, 33578848, 32075102).\n\nThis curation fell between Limited and Moderate. This Gene Curation Expert Panel (GCEP) elected to classify this gene-disease association as Limited given that the two reported cases are markedly different, and because the Fanconi anemia phenotype is not typical of primary mitochondrial disease leaving the possibility open that there is a separate genetic etiology in the first reported proband. No convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship.  This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease GCEP on March 18, 2024 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5f915f9e-a052-4edb-b891-5cfcd292defb","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/18fa1fc5-ce1b-4fec-9cc0-c94dd5c040c7","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/18fa1fc5-ce1b-4fec-9cc0-c94dd5c040c7_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2025-01-14T18:14:32.369Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/18fa1fc5-ce1b-4fec-9cc0-c94dd5c040c7_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2024-03-18T04:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"The primary mitochondrial disease GCEP elected to score this gene-disease association as limited given the two reported cases are markedly different and given the Fanconi Anemia phenotype is not typical of primary mitochondrial disease and suggests potential for an additional etiology in the one proband.
