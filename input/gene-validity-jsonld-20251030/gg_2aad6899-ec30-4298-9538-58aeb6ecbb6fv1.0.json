{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2aad6899-ec30-4298-9538-58aeb6ecbb6fv1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"The relationship between GP6 and Platelet-type bleeding disorder 11, an autosomal recessive disorder, was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of October 9, 2019. GP6 encodes the platelet membrane glycoprotein receptor for collagen. GPVI plays a critical role in collagen-induced platelet aggregation (PMID: 31351674, 31068042). Platelet-type bleeding disorder 11 is characterized by mild bleeding phenotypes and absent platelet aggregation in response to collagen (PMID: 31351674, 31068042). GP6 was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Platelet-type bleeding disorder 11 in 2009 (Hermans et al, 2009; PMID: 19552682 and Dumont et al, 2009; PMID: 19549989). At least 5 missense and frameshift variants have been reported in humans.  Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data.  \n \nSummary of Case Level Data (9.5 points): Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 6 probands in 3 publications (PMIDs: 19552682, 19549989, 23815599). The mechanism for disease is biallelic loss of function. \n\nSummary of Experimental Data (3.5 points): This gene-disease relationship is supported by animal models and expression studies. GP6-knock-out mice show absent platelet aggregation in response to collagen, similar to human patients (PMIDs: 12738669, 16139873) and platelets from GPVI-deficient mice are functionally abnormal (PMID: 12515812). The expression of GP6 is restricted to platelets and megakaryocytes (PMID: 10961879, 11278467). \n\nIn summary, the GP6 - Platelet-type Bleeding Disorder 11 gene-disease relationship is definitive. \nThis classification was approved by the ClinGen Hemostasis/Thrombosis GCEP on October 23, 2019 (SOP Version 7).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2aad6899-ec30-4298-9538-58aeb6ecbb6f","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/76262cf5-f2cd-4466-b542-bf2334a96c73","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/76262cf5-f2cd-4466-b542-bf2334a96c73_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2019-10-23T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/76262cf5-f2cd-4466-b542-bf2334a96c73_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/76262cf5-f2cd-4466-b542-bf2334a96c73_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8ada132e-5fdc-4962-9af3-4871fda642d7_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"This proband is scored reduced points as Patient 1 with the same variant has been scored default points already.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/54bae733-a676-4af8-9312-11cdba44fc6b","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23815599","rdfs:label":"Matus_Patient 2","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":11,"detectionMethod":"All 8 exons and splice sites of the GP6 gene were amplified by PCR and sequenced.","firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0000421","obo:HP_0000978","obo:HP_0001934"],"previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"PTT, APTT, thrombin time, platelet count, plasma VWF activity were normal.
