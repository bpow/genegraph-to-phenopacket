Variants in AARS were first reported in humans with this disease as early as 2015 (Simons et al., PMID 25817015). At least 1 frameshift and 3 missense variants have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 3 probands in 2 publications (PMID: 25817015, 28493438). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 2 additional family members. This gene-disease association is supported by functional studies that show variants' affects on yeast growth and catalytic efficiency in patient-derived cell lines. In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Epilepsy Working Group on 11/20/2018.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1d5f1422-ac4d-416b-88ca-f08c2d504013","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ac62fe65-ee56-4146-9fe4-00dc1db2d958","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ac62fe65-ee56-4146-9fe4-00dc1db2d958_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10005","date":"2018-11-20T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ac62fe65-ee56-4146-9fe4-00dc1db2d958_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10005","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ac62fe65-ee56-4146-9fe4-00dc1db2d958_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ac62fe65-ee56-4146-9fe4-00dc1db2d958_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3981c374-5309-49c3-9e3b-168604fd5d33","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Downgraded to be conservative because this is a yeast model that only suggests one variant could be pathogenic.
