Affected individuals frequently present at birth or in early childhood, although some families with such cases also include other members with late-onset disease, indicating variable expressivity and incomplete penetrance (PMID: 27270174). Affected individuals present in one or both eyes with increased corneal diameter, corneal edema, increased intraocular pressure, increased cup-to-disc ratio of the optic nerve, and/or Haab striae. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping & Splitting Working Group, the molecular mechanism (loss-of-function) was found to be distinct from patients diagnosed with multiple cutaneous and mucosal venous malformations, who similarly exhibit an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance but harbor gain-of-function variants in *TEK* that cluster within the protein kinase domain. In addition, the phenotypic differences between the two groups of cases appeared to represent separate disease entities rather than a single spectrum of disease. Therefore, cases caused by inherited *TEK* variants have been split into two separately-curated disease entities, referred to as primary congenital glaucoma-3E (MONDO:0014998, MIM #617272), and multiple cutaneous and mucosal venous malformations (MONDO:0010842, MIM #600195).  In order to acknowledge the broader spectrum of onset and variable expressivity of the ocular disease entity, it is referred to in this curation as *TEK*-related primary glaucoma (MONDO:0800182).\n\nThirteen patient-associated variants have been scored as part of this curation (four nonsense, seven missense, and two disrupting splicing), which have been collectively reported in thirteen probands in three publications (PMID: 27270174, PMID: 33027505, PMID: 34956319). All thirteen probands were heterozygous for their respective variants. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be monoallelic loss-of-function, caused by null and/or hypomorphic variants. Patient-associated missense variants exhibited diverse functional defects ranging from reduced autophosphorylation or defective ligand response to decreased expression, stability, or solubility (PMID: 27270174, PMID: 33027505, PMID: 34956319). It is important to note that the penetrance of *TEK* variants appears to be influenced in some cases by the presence of modifier alleles in related genes such as *CYP1B1* (PMID: 28620713), *SVEP1* (PMID: 33027505), and possibly *LTBP2* (PMID: 34956319), consistent with the possibility of digenic inheritance. However, none of the cases included in this curation were reported to harbor a potential modifier allele in another glaucoma-related locus. Segregation evidence was not available in these publications and has not contributed to the scoring of the gene-disease relationship.\n\nThis gene-disease association is also supported by experimental evidence. *TEK* encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase stimulated by angiopoietin ligands to transduce signals that regulate endothelial cell behavior and the development and maintenance of Schlemm's canal, an endothelial structure responsible for aqueous humor drainage in the eye (PMID: 18425120). This function may be mediated in part through upregulation of the *PROX1* gene, which encodes a downstream effector that positively regulates Schlemm’s canal and lymphatic cell fate (PMID: 28920924). *TEK* is highly expressed in ocular tissues (PMID: 30239781) and within the endothelial cells of Schlemm's canal in particular (PMID: 25051267). Mice with heterozygous disruption of the orthologous gene exhibit defects in Schlemm's canal, hypoplastic trabecular meshwork, impaired aqueous humor outflow, and increased intraocular pressure, (PMID: 27270174, PMID: 28920924), as well as enlargement of the anterior chamber (PMID: 25202984).\n\nIn summary, *TEK* is definitively associated with *TEK*-related primary glaucoma. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both research and diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time without the emergence of contradictory evidence, leading to a Definitive classification. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Glaucoma and Neuro-Ophthalmology Gene Curation Expert Panel on August 18th, 2022 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/94c1f649-fd76-43c0-aa07-8466bf626541","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/20f13e3f-f927-46c1-b5ed-919f696a7687","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/20f13e3f-f927-46c1-b5ed-919f696a7687_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10077","date":"2022-11-21T17:47:42.309Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/20f13e3f-f927-46c1-b5ed-919f696a7687_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10077","date":"2022-08-18T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/20f13e3f-f927-46c1-b5ed-919f696a7687_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b2c0bbab-0116-485d-82de-8ef1ccef252d","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The

is a canonical splice site variant in intron 5 shown by the authors in an exon trapping assay to disrupt mRNA splicing by abolishing a splice donor site and triggering use of a cryptic splice site that introduces a premature termination codon (Figure 4). This is predicted to trigger nonsense-mediated decay or at least truncate the C-terminal protein product (p.Ala254Glyfs*3).","functionalDataSupport":"Yes"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/aa4597ba-9517-41f9-928d-979dfa309cca_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27270174","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0e86afe9-79e5-478b-8e7e-686c7af386e3","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NC_000009.12:g.27172749T>C (GRCh38)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA373124808"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:Heterozygous"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/20f13e3f-f927-46c1-b5ed-919f696a7687_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/20f13e3f-f927-46c1-b5ed-919f696a7687_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/86215001-c987-4b77-b6f4-0bec43997e8e","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"TEK-deficient mouse models form an excellent phenotypic match and parallel the mode of inheritance of the human patients.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/90923d4f-42c2-43d4-b63b-2f05da85651c","type":"Finding","dc:description":"The mice match the human patients in that they exhibit abnormality of Schlemm's canal (convolutions and narrowing, Figure 5A) and increased intraocular pressure (Figures 5C, 6B, 6C).
