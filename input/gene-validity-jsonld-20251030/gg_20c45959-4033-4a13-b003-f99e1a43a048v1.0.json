At least 40 unique variants (e.g. missense, in-frame indel, nonsense, frameshift, etc.) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 13 probands in the two initial publications. Variants in this gene segregated with disease in two additional family members (Guernsey DL, et al., 2009, PMID: 19576563). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence has been reached. This gene-disease relationship is supported by the function of PYCR1 in proline metabolism, its expression in bone and skin, and animal models in Xenopus and Zebrafish with partial recapitulation of disease. In summary, PYCR1 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive cutis laxa. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/20c45959-4033-4a13-b003-f99e1a43a048","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ca242cd8-1f57-4c7b-ba97-5ec0c97b425b","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ca242cd8-1f57-4c7b-ba97-5ec0c97b425b_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10011","date":"2020-09-16T19:23:10.936Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ca242cd8-1f57-4c7b-ba97-5ec0c97b425b_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10011","date":"2020-05-21T19:16:07.864Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ca242cd8-1f57-4c7b-ba97-5ec0c97b425b_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cd54b9a3-d033-4dc3-b071-25ed60996933_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The homozygous missense variant Arg266Gln, at the last codon of exon 6, alters the canonical splice donor site. nested RT-PCR amplified spliced products confirmed skipping of exon 6 in patient mRNA.
