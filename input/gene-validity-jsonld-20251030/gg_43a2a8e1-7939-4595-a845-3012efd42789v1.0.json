The NDUFB8 gene encodes the NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) subunit B8, which is essential for complex I activity and assembly. Defects of this protein lead to complex I deficiency. \n\nThe NDUFB8 gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Leigh syndrome spectrum in 2018 (PMID: 29429571). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included four variants identified in two cases in one publication (PMID: 29429571). No segregation data were available. Loss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease association is also supported by biochemical function, functional alteration in non-patient cells, and animal models (PMIDs: 31127358, 27626371, 27509854).  \n\nIn summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on November 23, 2020 (SOP Version 7).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/43a2a8e1-7939-4595-a845-3012efd42789","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bef2c930-4b79-4938-8325-94a0f58cdfd9","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bef2c930-4b79-4938-8325-94a0f58cdfd9_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2021-01-21T00:45:10.925Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bef2c930-4b79-4938-8325-94a0f58cdfd9_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2021-01-21T00:44:58.566Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bef2c930-4b79-4938-8325-94a0f58cdfd9_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bef2c930-4b79-4938-8325-94a0f58cdfd9_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d0a6339b-03ee-4efd-92c6-318c3cbf34bc","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Scored for embryonic lethality, according to agreed rubric.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2c24e174-e49e-493b-95fb-fb5459a892b2","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Homozygous knockout noted as having preweaning lethality, https://www.mousephenotype.org/data/genes/MGI:1914514","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31127358","rdfs:label":"International Mouse Phenotyping consortium","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bef2c930-4b79-4938-8325-94a0f58cdfd9_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4e89380c-9c8f-4d88-94d3-d6a5261ee483","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"NDUFB8  is a complex I subunit required for complex I assembly and complex I activity.","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8b368c7a-6789-4296-a109-fa4dc020e351","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"NDUFB8 HEK293 knock out cell lines were generated using the TALENS system. \nBlue-native (BN)– PAGE and immunoblot analysis for subunits NDUFA9, NDUFA13 and NDUFB11 showed that in the KO line complex I assembly was disrupted (Fig 1.).","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27626371","rdfs:label":"HEK293 knock out cell lines"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bef2c930-4b79-4938-8325-94a0f58cdfd9_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fe37fc4c-136d-4e86-ac24-9c57618d08a2","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"At least 10 further complex I genes have been associated with Leigh syndrome spectrum, scored increased to 2pts as per rubric.","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/55bba7cf-1fc7-4e26-85af-96333bd656b3","type":"Finding","dc:description":"The study built on previous structural models of the complex I core and used further cryo EM mapping to model the location and interactions of all subunits present in complex I from Bos Taurus.
