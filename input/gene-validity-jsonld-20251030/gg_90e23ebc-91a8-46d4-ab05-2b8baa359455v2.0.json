Sarcosinemia is caused by a defect in the conversion of sarcosine to glycine, which is catalyzed by SARDH. The clinical phenotypes of sarcosinemia vary considerably and it has been suggested that it is a benign condition (Bar-joseph et al., 2010). All known  variants in SARDH were reported in humans with this disease in 2012 (Bar-joseph et al., 22825317). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes only one paper with case-level data.   In summary, there is  limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence, both genetic and experimental, is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence that contradicts the gene-disease relationship has been found. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Aminoacidopathy Working Group on 06/28/19 (SOP Version 6). It was reevaluated on 10/14/2022 with no new evidence found. As a result of this reevaluation, the classification remained Limited.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/90e23ebc-91a8-46d4-ab05-2b8baa359455","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2b994b6f-f296-45af-9d52-c1d0b211ef74","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","changes":[{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"},{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},{"id":"cg:sopChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2b994b6f-f296-45af-9d52-c1d0b211ef74_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10011","date":"2022-12-12T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2b994b6f-f296-45af-9d52-c1d0b211ef74_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10011","date":"2022-12-16T15:49:17.048Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2b994b6f-f296-45af-9d52-c1d0b211ef74_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2b994b6f-f296-45af-9d52-c1d0b211ef74_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/035d5933-4acf-4d21-bcfb-cb02367dee57","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Disruption of SARDH's involvement in the choline metabolic pathway is consistent with elevations of sarcosine in blood and urine.
