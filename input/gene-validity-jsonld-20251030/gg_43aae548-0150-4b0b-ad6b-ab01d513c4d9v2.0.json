Three variants (single nucleotide changes in microRNA) that have been reported in three probands in two publications (PMIDs: 19363479, 22038834) are included in this curation. The mechanism of pathogenicity is reported to be loss of function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by expression studies in mouse ear hair cells, biochemical function demonstrating the role of MIR96 as a regulator of genes involved in hearing, and multiple model systems replicating the human phenotype (PMIDs: 19363478, 21245307, 25759012, 26988146, 29325119, 29476110). In summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged. This gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the Hearing Loss GCEP on March 11, 2020. It was reevaluated on September 20, 2023. As a result of this reevaluation, the classification did not change due to a lack of new evidence.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/43aae548-0150-4b0b-ad6b-ab01d513c4d9","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/01d1a7f4-8421-4be3-8fe7-2c2025f03ac9","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","changes":[{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"},{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},{"id":"cg:sopChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/01d1a7f4-8421-4be3-8fe7-2c2025f03ac9_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2023-09-26T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/01d1a7f4-8421-4be3-8fe7-2c2025f03ac9_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2023-09-26T15:39:22.686Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"Mencia et al. 2009: The segregation scoring should be downgraded to 1.5 points at the most per the new segregation scoring rules.
