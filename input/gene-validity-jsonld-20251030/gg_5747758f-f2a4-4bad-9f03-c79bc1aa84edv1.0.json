{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5747758f-f2a4-4bad-9f03-c79bc1aa84edv1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"The relationship between *MT-TT* and primary mitochondrial disease was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of April 17, 2023. *MT-TT* encodes the mitochondrial tRNA for threonine, which is located from m.15888-15953 on the heavy strand of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Defects of this tRNA lead to impaired mitochondrial translation, which leads to decreased synthesis of mtDNA-encoded subunits of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes I, III, IV, and V, resulting in impaired OXPHOS enzyme activities. \n\n*MT-TT* was first reported in relation to maternally-inherited primary mitochondrial disease in 1991 (PMID: 1645537), in a girl with neonatal lactic acidosis. While various names could be given to the constellation of features seen in those with *MT-TT*-related disorders, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *MT-TT* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework.\n\nEvidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included five unique variants (m.15897G>A, m.15915G>A, m.15923A>G, m.15933G>A, m.15950G>A) in ten probands across ten publications (PMIDs: 32083134, 8769114, 9367299, 1645537, 8511015, 22638997, 29760464, 30236074, 28187756, 35808913). Age of onset in affected individuals varied from the neonatal period to more than 50 years. Clinical features in affected individuals included neonatal lactic acidosis; myoclonic epilepsy and ragged red fibers (MERRF); Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON); myopathy, seizures, migraines, pigmentary retinopathy, hearing loss, and diabetes. Brain imaging findings were variable. Muscle biopsies showed ragged red fibers and COX-deficient fibers. Labs showed elevated lactate. Heteroplasmy levels were highest in muscle when multiple tissues were assessed, and ranged from 33% to homoplasmy in muscle. The mechanism of disease appears to be loss of function.  This gene-disease association is further supported by a known biochemical function shared with other genes associated with primary mitochondrial disease (PMID: 30030363). \n\nIn summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts this gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on April 17, 2023 (SOP Version 9). \n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5747758f-f2a4-4bad-9f03-c79bc1aa84ed","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/99e85f3e-3c1f-4265-8b70-0870e95d4c30","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/99e85f3e-3c1f-4265-8b70-0870e95d4c30_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2023-04-17T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/99e85f3e-3c1f-4265-8b70-0870e95d4c30_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2023-08-10T20:37:09.463Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/99e85f3e-3c1f-4265-8b70-0870e95d4c30_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0c03cd9d-bdf2-4207-a284-a649a4e1e015","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"This scored 1 point given cybrid studies.","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0c03cd9d-bdf2-4207-a284-a649a4e1e015_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"Cybrids (Patient 1 and control individual) showed ATP amount was decreased; ROS were increased in mutants.
