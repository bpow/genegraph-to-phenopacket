{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/80149791-9af8-40ab-9940-e608b7efeb9cv1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"The relationship between *MTO1* and primary mitochondrial disease was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of March 4, 2024. The *MTO1* gene encodes mitochondrial tRNA translation optimization 1, which increases the accuracy and efficiency of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) translation by catalyzing the 5-carboxymethylaminomethylation of the wobble uridine base in three mitochondrial tRNAs (mt-tRNAs: tRNA-Gln, tRNA-Glu, and tRNA-Lys).  \n\nThe *MTO1* gene was first reported in relation to primary mitochondrial disease in 2012 (Ghezzi et al. (2012) PMID: 22608499. The condition was first described in a family from northern Italy in two siblings with infantile hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and lactic acidosis.  Subsequent publications have reported a consistently early onset disease characterized by lactic acidosis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and mild to severe global developmental delay. Phenotypic heterogeneity is observed with additional features such as feeding difficulties, optic atrophy, seizures and ataxia. Variability is reported in the severity of disease with many probands not surviving infancy while other affected individuals reached adolescence and early adulthood.  While various names could be given to the constellation of features seen in those with *MTO1*-related disease, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *MTO1* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework.\n\nEvidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included 10 unique variants reported in nine cases from five publications (PMIDs: 22608499, 23929671, 25058219, 29331171, 34547275). Variants included three frameshift, one nonsense, and six missense, one of which, c.1232C>T (p.Thr411Ile) is a proposed founder variant in the Pakistani population (PMID: 25058219). The maximum score for case-level data was reached in this curation; however we note that, in total, there appear to be at least 42 affected individuals reported in the medical literature.\n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by a biochemical function shared with other genes associated with primary mitochondrial disease. Mouse and zebrafish models recapitulate aspects of the cardiovascular phenotype associated with disease, together with altered mitochondrial morphology and biochemistry (PMIDs: 33340416, 25506927, 33836087). \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between *MTO1* and primary mitochondrial disease. This relationship has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on March 4, 2024 (SOP Version 10).
