The maximum amount of scorable genetic evidence has been published showing de novo as well as non-de novo variants occur in KRAS in patients with NS (Carta et al., 2006; Kratz et al., 2009; Nosan, Bertok, Vesel, Yntema, & Paro-Panjan, 2013; Schubbert et al., 2006). The KRAS gene is also located in the Ras/MAPK pathway, which is associated with the NS phenotype and variants found in NS patients in this gene disrupt the RAS pathway function as demonstrated by both mouse and zebrafish models (Aoki et al., 2016; Hernandez-Porras et al., 2014; Rauen, 2013; Razzaque et al., 2012). Of note, KRAS has also been classified as strong in association with cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome and as disputed in association with Costello syndrome. The ClinGen RASopathy Expert Panel found no evidence associating KRAS with NS-like disorder with loose anagen hair or NS with multiple lentigines. This curation was approved by the ClinGen RASopathy Gene Curation Expert Panel on 7/24/18 (SOP Version 5).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0fb05cd5-5cfc-40a8-8426-2900dc4ba682","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6476a5fd-8f66-462b-b17a-43540dad3c1f","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6476a5fd-8f66-462b-b17a-43540dad3c1f_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10021","date":"2021-03-09T16:52:10.481Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6476a5fd-8f66-462b-b17a-43540dad3c1f_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10021","date":"2018-07-24T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6476a5fd-8f66-462b-b17a-43540dad3c1f_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6476a5fd-8f66-462b-b17a-43540dad3c1f_ad_dn_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7bc53165-484c-4bc6-8b3b-3852b32a827b_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"This study screened a total of 175 NS patients for variants in the KRAS gene and identified 5 patients carrying a variant in the gene.
