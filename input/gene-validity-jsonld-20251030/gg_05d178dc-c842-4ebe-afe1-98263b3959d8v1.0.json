Galactokinase deficiency (also known as type II galactosemia) is an autosomal recessive disorder of galactose metabolism characterized by early onset cataracts (Ramani and Arya, 2021; PMID: 32809518). Over 40 variants in GALK1 have been reported in patients with galactokinase deficiency (Timson, 2016; PMID: 26143117). The mechanism for disease is biallelic loss of function. Biallelic variants in GALK were first reported in humans with this condition by Stambolian et al in 1995 (PMID 7670469). Ten patients with 11 unique variants in GALK (including missense, nonsense, frameshift, and canonical splice site) were curated (Stambolian et al, 1995, PMID 7670469; Asada et al, 1999, PMID 10570908; Kalaydjieva et al, 1999, PMID 10521295; Kolosha et al, 2000, PMID 10790206; Park et al, 2007, PMID 17517531; Yasmeen et al, 2010, PMID 20405025). Segregation data from two families also support this gene-disease association (Yasmeen et al, 2010, PMID 20405025). Of note, one of the variants curated, c.82C>A (p.Pro28Thr), is a founder variant in the Romani population (Kalaydjieva et al, 1999, PMID 10521295; Ramani and Arya, 2021; PMID: 32809518). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. \nThis gene-disease relationship is supported by the biochemical function of galactokinase, which catalyzes the phosphorylation of galactose to galactose-1-phosphate (Ballard, 1966, PMID 5971794; (Stambolian et al, 1995, PMID 7670469; Timson, 2016, PMID 26143117), and the features of a galactokinase null mouse model (Ai et al, 2000; PMID 10915771). In summary, GALK1 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive galactokinase deficiency. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This gene-disease classification was approved by the ClinGen General Inborn Errors of Metabolism Gene Curation Expert Panel. \n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/05d178dc-c842-4ebe-afe1-98263b3959d8","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ecd4568c-966e-4ac3-b3d2-b4ac119a7d80","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10084","role":"SecondaryContributor"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e88a619f-6191-4579-801c-4d13e4de24ed_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10097","date":"2022-01-29T23:13:24.204Z","role":"Unpublisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ecd4568c-966e-4ac3-b3d2-b4ac119a7d80_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10097","date":"2021-09-30T16:13:17.166Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ecd4568c-966e-4ac3-b3d2-b4ac119a7d80_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10097","date":"2022-01-29T23:13:24.204Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ecd4568c-966e-4ac3-b3d2-b4ac119a7d80_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9e805ae8-5257-4e43-aa2d-b557329c403d_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"This individual is homozygous for a nonsense variant, p.Gln382Ter.

While humans with galactokinase deficiency develop cataracts, galactokinase-deficient mice had no phenotype, likely due to the low expression of aldose reductase (which converts galactose to galactitol) in the lens in mice. When the mice were engineered to express human aldose reductase, they too developed cataracts. Of note, cataracts form in individuals with galactokinase deficiency because galactose cannot be metabolized and is converted to galactitol by aldose reductase. Galactitol results in osmotic stress, accumulating within lens fiber cells causing swelling, cell lysis and eventually cataracts (PMID: 26143117).

A block in the metabolism of galactose to galactose-1-phosphate, due to deficiency of galactokinase activty, results in elevated galactose which is present in blood and urine of patients.
