The classical presentation of ARC includes congenital joint contractures, renal tubular dysfunction, and cholestasis. Additional features include ichthyosis, central nervous system malformation, platelet anomalies, and severe failure to thrive. At least 19 unique variants (mostly nonsense but also frameshift, splicing, start loss, and missense) have been reported in humans with Pathogenic classifications in ClinVar. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 9 probands in 2 publications (PMIDs: 15052268, 18853461), included in this curation. Additional evidence is available in the literature, however the maximum points for genetic evidence were reached. This gene-disease relationship is supported by its interaction with VIPAS39 (PMID: 20190753) and their function as part of a complex that interacts with an active form of RAB11A involved in apical membrane protein sorting, the alteration in mIMCD-3 cells confirming the role of VPS33B in regulating apical-basolateral polarity in the kidney consistent with the renal dysfunction seen in patients (PMID: 20190753), a zebrafish model recapitulating biliary abnormalities (PMID: 20190753), and a mouse model with collagen abnormalities identified in skin fibroblasts and tendons consistent with the characteristic ARC features of ichthyosis, arthrogryposis, osteopenia and bone fractures (PMID: 27435297) as well as a marked reduction in α-granule count and the presence of small granule-like structures in agreement with the platelet phenotype observed in ARC patients (PMID: 25947942). In summary VPS33B is definitively associated with autosomal recessive arthrogryposis, renal dysfunction, and cholestasis 1.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f92c5c0c-cd10-400d-9123-71ff42c04754","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d38d685c-9aee-4660-9228-4119a4fd583d","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d38d685c-9aee-4660-9228-4119a4fd583d_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2021-03-24T16:05:34.056Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d38d685c-9aee-4660-9228-4119a4fd583d_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2021-03-24T16:05:46.267Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d38d685c-9aee-4660-9228-4119a4fd583d_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d38d685c-9aee-4660-9228-4119a4fd583d_seg_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/12580d99-37ad-49bc-aa41-a9509783e3eb_proband_segregation","type":"FamilyCosegregation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15052268","rdfs:label":"ARC01","estimatedLodScore":0.6,"family":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/12580d99-37ad-49bc-aa41-a9509783e3eb","type":"Family","rdfs:label":"ARC01","member":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/026fa9e3-f8bd-4423-96c4-0fc490284578","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15052268","rdfs:label":"ARC01 IV-2","ageType":"AgeAtDeath","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":3,"detectionMethod":"Amplified all exons from flanking primers and carried out direct sequencing.","firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0002014","obo:HP_0001943","obo:HP_0001776","obo:HP_0001695","obo:HP_0000952","obo:HP_0001558","obo:HP_0008872","obo:HP_0001508","obo:HP_0002804","obo:HP_0001252","obo:HP_0001947","obo:HP_0002045","obo:HP_0000103","obo:HP_0001954","obo:HP_0002611"],"previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"Excluded linkage to the candidate genes ATP8B1 and ABCB11, which are implicated in other disorders that cause neonatal cholestasis with low gGT activity.","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/10b87c78-37a7-4b96-a43e-9ae2a8d42010_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15052268","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ac266e36-0289-4e44-a480-bcb3673c68cc","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_018668.4(VPS33B):c.1594C>T (p.Arg532Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA115401"}},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"none"}}},"phenotypeNegativeAlleleNegative":0,"phenotypePositiveAllelePositive":2,"phenotypes":["obo:HP_0002804","obo:HP_0000124","obo:HP_0002611"],"proband":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/026fa9e3-f8bd-4423-96c4-0fc490284578"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValiditySegregationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9a3f00f2-a3c1-442c-8789-b2139db43a76_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The homozygous (by consanguinity) splice variant c.177+1G>A (here reported as IVS2+1G>A) is predicted to result in the skipping of exon 2, resulting in an in frame deletion of 27 amino acids (4.4% of the protein).

Abnormal collagen fibril morphology was also found in tail tendons, consistent with procollagen I accumulation found in patient fibroblasts. The collagen abnormalities identified in skin fibroblasts and tendons consistent with the characteristic ARC features of ichthyosis, arthrogryposis, osteopenia and bone fractures suggest an important role for VPS33B dependent trafficking in connective tissue.
