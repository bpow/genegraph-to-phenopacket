At least 2 unique variants (splicing, missense) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 2 probands in 1 publication (PMID: 30215711). This gene-disease association is supported by a zebrafish model (PMID: 30215711). In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. \n\nThis gene-disease pair was originally approved by the ClinGen Congenital Myopathies Working Group on 4/13/20 (SOP Version 7). It was reevaluated on 02/21/2025. As a result of this reevaluation no new evidence was identified and the classification remained at Limited.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/62800c79-e598-4557-866d-c136198da85f","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1c69fb71-4553-473e-94b7-a8c34af84739","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","changes":[{"id":"cg:sopChange"},{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1c69fb71-4553-473e-94b7-a8c34af84739_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10031","date":"2025-02-24T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1c69fb71-4553-473e-94b7-a8c34af84739_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10031","date":"2025-02-24T14:27:55.991Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["RecurationTiming"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1c69fb71-4553-473e-94b7-a8c34af84739_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0877a933-2c0b-4b1e-b2c1-d3e8bd1af6b0_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0877a933-2c0b-4b1e-b2c1-d3e8bd1af6b0","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30215711","rdfs:label":"Family 1 Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDeath","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":7,"allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a6f6f52f-db4a-44d7-9b1f-12ea62758470","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_079420.3(MYL1):c.479-2A>G","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/627413"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"flexion contractures in elbows, knees, and hips are mild","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0000467","obo:HP_0003458","obo:HP_0003273","obo:HP_0030319","obo:HP_0004887","obo:HP_0001284","obo:HP_0001290","obo:HP_0002987","obo:HP_0001522"],"sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a64a261f-7768-4239-b190-605f14243ead_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30215711","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a6f6f52f-db4a-44d7-9b1f-12ea62758470"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"}}},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a64a261f-7768-4239-b190-605f14243ead","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"This splice variant is homozygous due to consanguinity and expected to result in the in-frame skipping of exon 5 (p.Gly160_Glu185del), removing ~15% of the protein including the end of the second EF-hand motif.
