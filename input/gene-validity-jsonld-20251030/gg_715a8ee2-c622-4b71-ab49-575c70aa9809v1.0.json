The NDUFC2 gene encodes the NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) subunit C2, which also plays a role in complex I assembly. Defects of this protein lead to complex I deficiency. \n\nThe NDUFC2 gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Leigh syndrome spectrum in 2020 (PMID: 32969598). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included two variants identified in two cases in one publication (PMID: 32969598). No segregation data were available. Loss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease association is also supported by known protein interaction, functional alteration in non-patient cells, and functional alteration in patient cells (PMIDs: 27509854, 27626371, 32969598).  \n\nIn summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on November 23, 2020 (SOP Version 7).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/715a8ee2-c622-4b71-ab49-575c70aa9809","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3d819bce-43ed-45a3-a16b-74033d432272","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3d819bce-43ed-45a3-a16b-74033d432272_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2021-01-21T00:40:55.963Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3d819bce-43ed-45a3-a16b-74033d432272_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2021-01-21T00:41:06.506Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3d819bce-43ed-45a3-a16b-74033d432272_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3d819bce-43ed-45a3-a16b-74033d432272_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0e89c4a3-a58d-4ed7-bb57-6ad45b4a00cb","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"NDUFC2 is required for assembly of the complex I holoenzyme.","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1f795194-1cd5-482b-a05f-c7680b8326f2","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Complexome profiling using mass spectrometry showed an accumualtion of an assembly intermediate comprising of the Q module plus assembly factor TIMMDC1 amd NDUFA13 subunits in patient fibroblasts from subjects 1 and 3.
