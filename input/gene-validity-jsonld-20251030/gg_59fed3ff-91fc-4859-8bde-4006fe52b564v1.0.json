{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/59fed3ff-91fc-4859-8bde-4006fe52b564v1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"The relationship between NDUFS8 and Leigh syndrome spectrum was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of November 20, 2019. The NDUFS8 gene encodes the NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) core subunit S8. Defects of this protein lead to complex I deficiency. \n\nThe NDUFS8 gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Leigh syndrome spectrum in 1998 (PMID: 9837812). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data.\n\nThis curation included seven unique variants identified in five cases from five publications (PMIDs: 9837812, 22200994, 15159508, 23430795, 20818383). No segregation data were available. Loss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease association is also supported by known protein interactions and animal models (PMIDs: 21924235, 19672299, 29285794, 27509854). \n\nIn summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel November 20, 2019 (SOP Version 7).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/59fed3ff-91fc-4859-8bde-4006fe52b564","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/01a27520-f92a-4b81-b63b-c15132c873be","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/01a27520-f92a-4b81-b63b-c15132c873be_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2019-11-25T15:24:06.734Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/01a27520-f92a-4b81-b63b-c15132c873be_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/01a27520-f92a-4b81-b63b-c15132c873be_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/01a27520-f92a-4b81-b63b-c15132c873be_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c4c1bdf8-23e1-4f6e-aff5-ae9a8e7ea08c","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"This fly model recapitulates neurodegeneration, shortened lifespan, motor disability of LS.
