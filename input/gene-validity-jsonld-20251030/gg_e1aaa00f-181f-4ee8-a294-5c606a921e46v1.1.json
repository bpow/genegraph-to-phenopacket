The underlying mechanism is biallelic loss-of function variants in the *BBS12* gene, with the mutation spectrum including predominantly missense, nonsense, and frameshift variants. This curation has collected and scored data from 2 consanguineous families and 1 isolated individual with 4 unique variants (PMID: 17160889, PMID: 20648243, PMID: 36574078). Additional genetic evidence was available in the literature but was not included as the maximum score for this category had already been reached.\n\nExperimental evidence for the gene-disease relationship included a zebrafish model with suppression of *bbs12* expression that exhibited defects in gastrulation and movement such as short body axis, broader somites, kinking of the notochord, and dorsal thinning, similar to the phenotypes caused by silencing of other *BBS* gene orthologs (PMID: 17160889). The participation of the BBS12 protein in a complex with BBS6 and BBS10 was also scored as protein interaction data (PMID: 20080638).\n\nIn summary, *BBS12* is definitively associated with BBS12-related ciliopathy, in which one of the major features is retinal dystrophy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time without the emergence of contradictory evidence. This clinical validity classification was approved by the ClinGen Retina Gene Curation Expert Panel on January 4th, 2024 (SOP version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e1aaa00f-181f-4ee8-a294-5c606a921e46","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3aefcbae-bf06-45da-b3be-a550e997257a","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3aefcbae-bf06-45da-b3be-a550e997257a_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10072","date":"2024-01-04T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3aefcbae-bf06-45da-b3be-a550e997257a_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10072","date":"2025-01-04T02:09:48.062Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["DiseaseNameUpdate"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3aefcbae-bf06-45da-b3be-a550e997257a_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3aefcbae-bf06-45da-b3be-a550e997257a_seg_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c4a02676-8ca6-4873-b537-6a4b212d7376_proband_segregation","type":"FamilyCosegregation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20648243","rdfs:label":"MR-10","estimatedLodScore":2.08,"family":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c4a02676-8ca6-4873-b537-6a4b212d7376","type":"Family","rdfs:label":"MR-10","ethnicity":{"id":"cg:UnknownEthnicity"},"member":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/246d582f-b12f-465d-8466-c9061bc12848","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20648243","rdfs:label":"IV-3","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":13,"allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9ce9f178-2374-4a2b-a713-6ba2df4649cc","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_152618.3(BBS12):c.2102C>A (p.Ser701Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA358226565"}},"detectionMethod":"Genome-wide mapping using the Affymetrix GeneChip Human Mapping 10K Array.
