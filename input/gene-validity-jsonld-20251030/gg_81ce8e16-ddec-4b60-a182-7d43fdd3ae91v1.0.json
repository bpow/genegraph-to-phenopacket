Whereas truncating variants or missense variants in the receptor domain of TGFBR1 cause multiple self-healing squamous epithelioma (MSSE; OMIM 132800) with loss of function mechanism. There is abundant evidence published associating the TGFBR1 gene with MSSE, since the gene-disease relationship was first proposed by Goudie et al. (2011). Multiple case level studies have been performed with MSSE patients that have variants in the TGFBR1 gene. At least 11 different mutations in 18 families were reported. A significant amount of case-level data is available, however the maximum points for genetic evidence has been reached (12 points). Nonsense mediated mRNA decay or loss of heterozygosity were detected in patients' samples. Frequent TGFBR1 mutations are identified in human vemurafenib- or Sorafenib-induced skin lesions and in squamous cell carcinomas with loss of TGFb signalling. Deletion of Tgfbr1 coupled with BRAF/KRAS activation or Tp53 mutation/deletion leads to skin tumorigenesis in mice. All of these types of evidence are consistent with a definitive relationship between the TGFBR1 gene and multiple self-healing squamous epithelioma.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/81ce8e16-ddec-4b60-a182-7d43fdd3ae91","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/570947a0-3e45-419c-bc22-0fdc60ca6009","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/570947a0-3e45-419c-bc22-0fdc60ca6009_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10023","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/570947a0-3e45-419c-bc22-0fdc60ca6009_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10023","date":"2019-12-20T21:25:50.834Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/570947a0-3e45-419c-bc22-0fdc60ca6009_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/570947a0-3e45-419c-bc22-0fdc60ca6009_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6f617995-1779-4123-8cb6-86898d1dbc7b","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/43aac461-532d-477c-a214-a6c65f9ba017","type":"Finding","dc:description":"MAPK pathway hyperactivation (through BrafV600E or KrasG12D knockin) and TGFb signalling ablation (through Tgfbr1 deletion) in LGR5+ve stem cells enables rapid cSCC development in the mouse.

The histological features as described in the study mimic closely those of MSSE tumours at all stages of development; tumour regression occurred within four months after therapy was discontinued. Two tumours had missense mutations in the TGFBR1 gene, one occurred in a keratoacanthoma and the other in an in situ squamous cell carcinoma.
