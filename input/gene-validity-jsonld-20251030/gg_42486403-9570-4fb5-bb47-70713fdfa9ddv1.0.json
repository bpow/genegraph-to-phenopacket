Variation in *ABCC9* has been reported in Cantú Syndrome (ClinGen curated definitive) cases as well as non-syndromic cardiac disease cases. For the non-syndromic cardiac disease cases curated here, features of Brugada Syndrome, atrial fibrillation, early repolarization syndrome, and sudden cardiac arrest have been reported in at least seven cases. All but one of the reported variants are missense with the remaining being a short frame shifting indel. Most of the curated variants have a high population frequency in gnomAD v4.1, and what functional data that is available is not conclusive. Evidence disputing this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. There are two primary isoforms of the coding product, SUR2A and SUR2B. SUR2A is considered to be a primarily cardiac specific isoform; however, while it is expressed in cardiac tissue, expression is not entirely unique to the heart (PMID 8798681). In summary, the evidence supporting the relationship between *ABCC9* and autosomal dominant Brugada syndrome has been disputed and no valid evidence remains to support the claim. More evidence is needed to either support or entirely refute the role *ABCC9* plays in this disease. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hereditary Cardiovascular Disease GCEP on the meeting date October 28, 2025 (SOP Version 11).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/42486403-9570-4fb5-bb47-70713fdfa9dd","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1c570e3b-1b32-4547-84a2-144db782025e","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1c570e3b-1b32-4547-84a2-144db782025e_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10104","date":"2025-10-28T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1c570e3b-1b32-4547-84a2-144db782025e_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10104","date":"2025-10-30T16:31:36.614Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"Isolated cardiac disease in ABCC9 has been reported infrequently since the first assertion in 2014. The reports do not consistently rule out co-occuring features that are common with Cantú Syndrome, a disease assertion for ABCC9 variation with significantly more case data available. Additionally, several of the variants identified have frequencies inconsistent with pathogenicity. Lastly, functional evidence from patch-clamp experiments have identified significant impact for a high frequency variant, making the interpretation of other variants impact difficult.","curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1c570e3b-1b32-4547-84a2-144db782025e_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1c570e3b-1b32-4547-84a2-144db782025e_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/21cce94b-054b-4448-aed8-19d992dddeac","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Reduced score due to detectable expression outside of cardiac tissue that overlaps entirely with SUR2B expression","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e169d36b-7d2c-441b-b3de-7d0a0f4fb374","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Tissue based RT-PCR probing specifically for SUR2A, and SUR2B coding isoforms of ABCC9 with SUR2A expression having a much more narrow expression pattern.
