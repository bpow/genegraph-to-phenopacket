(PMID: 10973238) and Katsanis et al. (PMID: 10973251). BBS is a rare genetically heterogeneous ciliopathy, characterized by rod-cone dystrophy, polydactyly, obesity, genital anomalies, renal anomalies, and intellectual disabilities. *MKKS* variants have also been reported in relation to cases diagnosed as McKusick-Kaufman syndrome (PMID: 10802661). Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping & Splitting Working Group, the mode of inheritance (autosomal recessive) and molecular mechanism (biallelic *MKKS* loss of function) have been found to be consistent among patients diagnosed with either Bardet-Biedl syndrome 6 (MIM# 605231) or McKusick-Kaufman syndrome (MIM# 236700), while the phenotypic variability between cases appears to represent a spectrum of disease rather than separate disease entities. Therefore, cases caused by inherited biallelic *MKKS* variants have been lumped into a single disease entity, referred to as MKKS-related ciliopathy.\n\nThis curation includes twelve variants (five missense, three nonsense and four frameshift) that have been reported in thirteen probands in eight publications (PMIDs: 10973238, 10973251, 12107442, 20472660, 15770229, 20177705, 28761321 and 30718709). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. \n\nThis gene-disease association is also supported by experimental data showing that *MKKS* is expressed in tissues affected by BBS (PMID: 10973238 ). This gene-disease association is also supported by biochemical evidence that the MKKS protein shares a function with the products of the *BBS10* and *BBS12* genes to mediate the assembly of the BBSome, a complex that performs vesicle transport to primary cilia and contributes to adipocyte differentiation. Through yeast two hybrid and coimmunoprecipitatin assays, Rachel et al. 2012 show that MKKS physically interacts with CEP290, a critical protein in ciliary biogenises and function, and that MKKS variants found in human BBS patients disrupt this protein-protein interaction (PMID: 22446187). Finally, multiple *Mkks*-knockout mouse models show that mice without a functional copy of *Mkks* display severe retinal degeneration compared to wild-type mice (PMIDs: 30901771 and 15772095).\n\nIn summary, *MKKS* is definitively associated with autosomal recessive MKKS-related ciliopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Retina GCEP on May 2nd, 2024 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/11718869-f93d-4b8f-bef9-61166f21a472","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c054871f-bcf0-48c1-a252-5c02d05adc97","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c054871f-bcf0-48c1-a252-5c02d05adc97_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10072","date":"2024-05-02T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c054871f-bcf0-48c1-a252-5c02d05adc97_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10072","date":"2025-01-04T04:23:05.827Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["DiseaseNameUpdate"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c054871f-bcf0-48c1-a252-5c02d05adc97_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c054871f-bcf0-48c1-a252-5c02d05adc97_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0800c8d2-9e28-481d-bc7e-4b04bbdeac8a","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/29704b6c-ecf2-44d4-b789-4a0fdf87f9f5","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Northern blot showing that MKKS is epxressed in tissues affected by BBS","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10973238","rdfs:label":"Slavotinek_Expression","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/58b2ea4a-29ae-4677-90cd-0fc007c46817","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Score increased due to evidence from a zebrafish morpholino model in which \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4fd750ab-ac80-4499-8bbf-939606ba5257","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Cep290 has been implicated in diseases of ciliogenesis such as McKusick-Kaufmann syndrome, Joubert syndrome, Bardet-Biedl syndrome and Leber congenital amaurosis.\n\nIn mice, a recessive Cep290rd16 mutant allele that results in deletion of 299 residues (from amino acids 1599–1897; NP_666121) in the CEP290 protein is associated with severe LCA-like photoreceptor degeneration and olfactory dysfunction (41, 42). When used as bait in yeast 2-hybrid assays, the Cep290rd16 deleted region (termed deleted in sensory dystrophy [DSD] domain) interacted with full-length MKKS as prey (Figure (Figure1B).1B). Eight other cilia-associated proteins (BBS2, BBS4, BBS5, BBS8, and NPHP1, NPHP2, NPHP4, and NPHP5) did not reveal any obvious interaction with the DSD domain (Figure (Figure1B).1B). Evaluation of MKKS mutants/variants identified in human patients with BBS (Figure (Figure1A)1A) revealed that the p.G52D and p.G345E mutations eliminated the interaction with CEP290-DSD bait, while 2 others (p.T57A and p.C499S) reduced this association (Figure (Figure1C),1C), using yeast 2-hybrid assays. \n\nCoimmunoprecipitation experiments using transfected HEK293 cells (Figure (Figure2,2, A and B) or bovine retina extracts (Figure (Figure2C)2C) validated the interaction of CEP290 with MKKS. As in the yeast 2-hybrid assays with CEP290 and MKKS human mutant plasmids (Figure (Figure1C),1C), human MKKS mutations altered or abrogated the biochemical interaction between in vitro transfected CEP290 and MKKS (Figure (Figure2A).2A). \n\nCoinjection into zebrafish embryos of subminimal dosages of the 2 morpholinos (0.5 ng cep290 and 1.0 ng mkks) that did not show ciliary anomalies on their own resulted in significant eye and inner ear defects (smaller eye size, altered retinal lamination, and defective inner ear tether cell development) as well as axis abnormalities (17.8%, n = 37 out of 208 morphants, compared with 6.5%, n = 16 out of 245 uninjected; P < 0.001) (Figure ​(Figure3,3, A–C). Together, these results are consistent with defects in cilia function (33, 46, 47). These studies in zebrafish suggest a functional synergy between CEP290 and MKKS during normal retinal and otocyst development.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22446187","rdfs:label":"Rachel_MKKSandCep290_Association","demonstrates":{"id":"obo:MI_0915"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bb9d1083-01d2-4227-aa3a-e08f3bbb99a7","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8d9367d4-edc0-42ae-adad-443380b4455f","type":"Finding","dc:description":"PMID: 19190184","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28824921","rdfs:label":"MKKS_Biochemical","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionA"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c054871f-bcf0-48c1-a252-5c02d05adc97_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/73ff6a5a-6ac1-4af1-924a-669ed71652cb","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9f731c71-b86a-410e-9e80-ae151346f893","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Mkks−/− mice appeared to have normal retinas early in life but subsequently undergo retinal degeneration.
