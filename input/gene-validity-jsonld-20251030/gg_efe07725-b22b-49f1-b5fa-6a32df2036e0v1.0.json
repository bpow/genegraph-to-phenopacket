FHL3 is a heterogeneous disease characterized by fever, hepatosplenomegaly, and hemophagocytosis with frequent occurrence of a range of additional features, including splenomegaly, central nervous system involvement (e.g., headache, encephalopathy, cranial nerve palsies, seizures, and ataxia), viral infections, malignancy (e.g., leukemia), neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and deficient natural killer cell activity (PMID: 14622600, 31506890, 32107531, 32679608, 34964741). Furthering the phenotypic spectrum, individuals with late-onset HLH and/or atypical features have been reported, which may be associated with hypomorphic variants in *UNC13D* (PMID: 17993578, 21881043, 28848550, 29312353).\nEight variants (in-frame deletion, nonsense, frameshift, canonical splice site, intronic) that have been reported in six probands in two publications (PMIDs: 14622600, 34964741) are included in this curation. Notably, more than 300 patients with FHL associated with *UNC13D* variants have been reported to date (PMID: 32679608). However, the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of disease is known to be loss of function. Among variants identified in FHL3 patients, an 253-kb inversion and deep intronic variants have been reported in many cases (PMID: 21931115, 24470399). Interestingly, there is also evidence supporting an additional digenic mode of inheritance of FHL, where heterozygous *UNC13D* variants have been identified with heterozygous variants in other degranulation pathway genes in patients with FHL (PMID: 34868048). This gene-disease association is also supported by experimental evidence, including animal models, expression studies, in vitro functional assays, and gene transfer rescue studies (PMIDs: 14522600, 1554890, 17420270, 20823128, 23590328, 24842371, 31032638). *UNC13D*, encoding Munc13-4, has been determined to be a positive regulator of degranulation (PMID: 15548590). Patient cells demonstrate defects in natural killer cell and CD8 T cell degranulation (PMID: 20823128), which can be rescued by retroviral transduction of *UNC13D* (PMID: 31032638). A mouse model of FHL3 (i.e., Jinx) recapitulates aspects of human disease and transfection of UNC13D into Jinx-derived cells rescues some of these defects (PMID: 17420270, 23590328). \nIn summary, *UNC13D* is definitively associated with autosomal recessive familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis 3. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/efe07725-b22b-49f1-b5fa-6a32df2036e0","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1b2b30c4-5544-476f-8c2f-c2511c69ccfc","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1b2b30c4-5544-476f-8c2f-c2511c69ccfc_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10145","date":"2024-01-03T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1b2b30c4-5544-476f-8c2f-c2511c69ccfc_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10145","date":"2024-01-03T20:12:18.688Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1b2b30c4-5544-476f-8c2f-c2511c69ccfc_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5d491c13-1d49-41c6-90cc-3158d2bfcbb7_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d7f8151b-24f0-40ae-badf-be140790ea9f","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Freq of this variant is consistent with disease.
