Therefore, the AD and AR phenotypes have been split in to separate curations. Roifman-Chitayat syndrome (613328) is split as well, but not curated due to digenic inheritance.\n\nThe relationship between PIK3CD and immunodeficiency 14, an autosomal dominant disorder, was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of April, 2022. PIK3CD encodes Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit delta (P110δ), which binds to the p85 regulatory subunit and effects mTOR/AKT phosphorylation. Immunodeficiency 14, also known as Activated PI3K Delta Syndrome 1 (APDS1), is characterized by recurrent infections (often sinopulmonary), hypogammaglobulinemia, splenomegaly, lymphoid nodules on mucosal surfaces, abscesses, decreased circulating B cells, autoimmunity (cytopenias), B-lymphoma (PMIDs: 29599784, 24165795, 24610295, 30738173). \n\nPIK3CD was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant immunodeficiency 14 in 2006 by Jou et al  (PMID: 16984281); however, detailed description of the gene variant or the phenotype was not provided. Angulo et al, 2013 (PMID: 24136356) and Lucas et al, 2014 (PMID: 24165795) studied a large number of individuals with APDS and reported variants in PIK3CD. A few pathogenic missense variants have been reported in humans in the ClinVar database. The E1021K variant is the most frequently observed variant in affected individuals, accounting for about 85% of disease (PMID: 31111319). The PIK3CD gene is highly constrained for missense variation (Z= 4.27, gnomAD v2.1.1). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data.  \n   \nSummary of Case Level Data (12 points):\nVariants in this gene have been reported in at least 22 probands in 12 publications (PMID: 27697496, 30499059, 2810446, 24165795, 33080915, 31031754, 27426521, 30138677, 28578023, 28414062, 24136356, 16984281). Multiple reports of the E1021K are available in the literature but a founder effect is ruled out and the variants are thought to have arisen independently (PMID: 24136356). Some of the variants, including the E1021K variant, are also proven de novo variants. The mechanism for disease is gain of function and missense variants found across the gene can cause activation of PI3Kδ.  \n  \nSummary of experimental data (6 points):\nThis gene-disease association is supported by in vitro functional assays and animal models. PIK3CD interacts with PIK3R1 and performs a similar function (PMID: 9235916, 28167755). It is predominantly expressed in leukocytes (PMID: 9235916). Several knock-in mouse models have been reported in the literature that recapitulate the cellular phenotype and provide insights into the function of p110δ in the immune process (PMID: 30093657, 30194267, 30018075, 30738173).\n  \nIn summary, PIK3CD is definitively associated with autosomal dominant immunodeficiency 14. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Antibody Deficiencies GCEP on April 19, 2022 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/04db3fff-d1aa-4941-83d4-2bb662e08f8a","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c37954fd-7d7c-4ca9-9cd0-7681c1edf8d3","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c37954fd-7d7c-4ca9-9cd0-7681c1edf8d3_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10080","date":"2022-04-19T15:05:47.546Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c37954fd-7d7c-4ca9-9cd0-7681c1edf8d3_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10080","date":"2022-04-20T21:11:37.555Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c37954fd-7d7c-4ca9-9cd0-7681c1edf8d3_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c37954fd-7d7c-4ca9-9cd0-7681c1edf8d3_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/501a2923-359d-4fd5-9e5b-0bb1de16f00b","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The mouse model is scored slightly increased points for the recapitulation of the cellular phenotype in a knock-in model using a human-derived variant.

Mice homozygous for the E1020K variant showed even greater activation of the signaling pathways indicating a dose-dependent effect of the variant. The increase levels of pAkt and pS6 could be reduced by incubation with leniolisib, a p110δ-specific inhibitor, indicating that the activation was PI3K dependent. This inhibition could paritally rescue defects in B cell differentiation. Analysis of BM revealed an increase in pro-B cells and a decrease in mature recirculating IgD-hi cells in Pik3cdE1020K GOF mice compared with WT controls. Analysis of B cell populations in the circulation revealed comparable proportions of total B cells in Pik3cdE1020K GOF mice, but increased proportions of B1 and transitional B cells and decreased proportions of mature B cells compared with WT mice. Ig class switching was impaired in GOF mice - 50% fewer Pik3cdE1020K GOF follicular B cells were positive for the switched isotypes upon stimulation compared with B cells from WT mice.\n\nFurther studied using the same mouse model in PMID: 30738173 describe CD4+ T cell dysfunction. Similar to patients with APDS1 presenting with lymphoproliferation and splenomegaly, spleens of GOF mice had increased total cellularity compared to WT spleens. In older mice, there was an increase in the percentage of CD4+ T cells, a decrease in frequency of naive CD4+ T and corresponding increase in memory cells. Further, authors show that T-follicular helper cells were less efficient than WT Tfh in providing help to B cell and forming an equivalent germinal center, and subsequently in antibody secretion and regulation of Ig isotype switching.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30018075","rdfs:label":"Avery_CRISPR/Cas9 Knock-in Mouse","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e4670baf-caa7-4bb6-b071-2e8ace53a42a","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Human-derived variant is knocked in to the mouse model showing GOF effect and recapitulation of the human phenotype.
