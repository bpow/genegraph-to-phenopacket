However, variable expressivity, age of ascertainment, and outdated clinical assessments of affected individuals may complicate the clinical diagnosis of Noonan syndrome (NS) versus CFC. Furthermore, there is sufficient variant overlap between KRAS-associated Noonan and CFC phenotypes. Additional genotype-phenotype correlations are necessary to solidify the association of KRAS with CFC syndrome, therefore it cannot yet be classified as Definitive. The KRAS gene is also located in the Ras/MAPK pathway, which is associated with the CFC phenotype (Aoki et al., 2016; Rauen, 2013). Of note, KRAS has also been classified as Definitive in association with Noonan syndrome and as Disputed in association with Costello syndrome. The ClinGen RASopathy Expert Panel found no evidence associating KRAS with NS-like disorder with loose anagen hair or NS with multiple lentigines. In summary, the evidence supporting the association between KRAS and CFC is Strong. This curation was approved by the ClinGen RASopathy Gene Curation Expert Panel on 7/24/18 (SOP Version 5).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/370b88ff-195d-4c88-add2-001e8e5aec6c","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/248e0d6b-9300-4d17-a350-f742fa92c82c","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/248e0d6b-9300-4d17-a350-f742fa92c82c_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10021","date":"2018-07-24T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/248e0d6b-9300-4d17-a350-f742fa92c82c_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10021","date":"2021-03-09T16:59:22.171Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"See evidence summary","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/248e0d6b-9300-4d17-a350-f742fa92c82c_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/248e0d6b-9300-4d17-a350-f742fa92c82c_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/67b8109e-b530-489c-b944-89ce6b32fa70","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b43a8a11-ee5b-46bd-b53c-2f56ade851fc","type":"Finding","dc:description":"established RAS/MAPK gene which is a pathway associated with CFC>","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23875798","rdfs:label":"KRAS is in RAS/MAPK pathway","demonstrates":{"id":"obo:MI_0915"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/248e0d6b-9300-4d17-a350-f742fa92c82c_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c34ce448-f6e9-494d-adee-5fe172fb31b5","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"endpoint is not specific to NS","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fea2cd21-218a-485d-ad87-15d84de2b3bf","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"The luciferase assay revealed that the D153V protein led to significantly higher level of ELK activation than the WT.
