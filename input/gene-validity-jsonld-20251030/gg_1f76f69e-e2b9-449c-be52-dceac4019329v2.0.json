Platelet aggregation was studied in one member of one family and resulted impaired in response to arachidonic acid. None of the patients showed bleeding symptoms.\n\n10 unique variants have been reported in humans, 8 missense, 2 frameshift and 1 stop.\n\nEvidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes genetic evidences (case-level data) and experimental evidences (functional evidence of protein expression, biochemical function, non-human model organisms).\n\nSummary of Case Level Data: 7.8 POINTS Variants in this gene have been reported in 12 GHDD probands in 7 publications (PMIDs 18264100, 27156553, 28868793, 33244729, 33595912, 35395429, 36574346\n) leading to a score of 7.8 for genetic evidence. The mechanism for disease is homozygous loss of function.\n\nSummary of Experimental Data: 3 POINTS This gene-disease association is supported by evidences of Biochemical Function (B): in human and horse platelet microsomes a molecule that converted prostaglandin endoperoxides into TXA2 was found. This molecule was ascertained to be thromboxane synthase (PMID 934294). Evidence of protein expression (A): Thromboxane synthase was purified from human platelets a close analogy to the group of cytochrome P-450 proteins was established. The purified enzyme catalyzed the formation of the stable end product thromboxane B2 from its substrate prostaglandin H2 (PMID: 2999104). A mouse model knockout for TBXAS1 showed similarities but also differences from GHDD patients: the mouse model showed a lack of platelet aggregation in response to arachidonic acid and a defect in TXA2 production, compatible with patients with GHDD. However, patients with GHDD do not have any bleeding problem while the TXAS-/- mouse show increased bleeding time, moreover the mouse model do not show increased bone density, myelophthisic anemia, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia (PMID: 15010374).\n\nIt is worth noting that a disease called “Thromboxane Synthase deficiency” (OMIM 614158) was described. Patients show bleeding, impaired aggregation in response to arachidonic acid but normal aggregation in response to the thromboxane analogue U46619, decreased serum TXB2, phenotypes compatible with a deficiency of Thromboxane Synthase (Weiss et al PMID 66560, Mestel et al PMID 6101498, Defreyn et al PMID 6268139). However, DNA analysis was not carried out in these patients and we can not establish an association with variants in TBXAS1.\n\nIn summary, we found  moderate association of TBXAS1 with Ghosal hematodiaphyseal syndrome.\n\nThis gene-disease pair was originally approved by the HT GCEP on 10/28/2020. As a result of the current reevaluation new genetic evidence was identified (PMIDs: 33244729, 33595912, 35395429, 36574346) but the classification remained at Moderate (SOP Version 9). This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hemostasis Thrombosis Working Group on 06/07/2023 (SOP Version 9).\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1f76f69e-e2b9-449c-be52-dceac4019329","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/612c46e2-8b4f-4bff-9d8b-28769d8854e2","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","changes":[{"id":"cg:sopChange"},{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"},{"id":"cg:newEvidence"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/612c46e2-8b4f-4bff-9d8b-28769d8854e2_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2023-06-07T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/612c46e2-8b4f-4bff-9d8b-28769d8854e2_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2023-06-07T19:45:46.173Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/612c46e2-8b4f-4bff-9d8b-28769d8854e2_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/612c46e2-8b4f-4bff-9d8b-28769d8854e2_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7ca19d40-9b72-423e-8cce-6064ac47c6fc","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"This work reveled the presence of thromboxane synthase in platelets","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ea7af85b-a163-4ddd-8c91-1e31b2b6918d","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Thromboxane synthase from human platelets was purified by conventional chromatographic techniques.
