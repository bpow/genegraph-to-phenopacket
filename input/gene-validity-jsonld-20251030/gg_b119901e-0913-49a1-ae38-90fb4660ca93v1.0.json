One proband with a truncating variant reported in a publication was included in this curation (PMID: 33084842). This gene-disease relationship is supported by expression studies and biochemical function study (PMIDs: 7851641, 11507771, 21743496). In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship.
