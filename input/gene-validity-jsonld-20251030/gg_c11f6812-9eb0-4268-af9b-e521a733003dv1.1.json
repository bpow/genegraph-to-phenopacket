This classification was approved by the ClinGen PIRD GCEP on the meeting date November 21, 2023 (SOP Version 11).\n\n**The following amendment was approved by the Monogenic Diabetes GCEP April 30, 2025**\nBiallelic pathogenic variants in IL2RA are a rare cause of autosomal recessive IL2RA (AKA CD25) deficiency that often presents in infancy with recurrent viral, fungal, and bacterial infections, lymphadenopathy, and variable autoimmune IPEX-like features, such as autoimmune enteropathy and eczematous skin lesions, as well as diabetes, which has often been described as a feature. \nOf 15 reported cases, diabetes was described as the presenting feature in 6 cases (6/15 = 40%) (PMID:17196245, 29995861, 29329106, 31605764, 38408297). When diabetes was the presenting feature, it occurred at very young ages (2 days – 15 weeks of age), suggesting that genetic testing for neonatal diabetes is an important path leading to diagnosis of this rare condition. Diabetes was described as an additional non-presenting feature in 3 additional cases (PMID:29183106, 31605764, 35662751), suggesting that diabetes is present in more than half of affected IL2RA cases (9/15 = 60%). In many cases scant clinical details were provided, but most suggested that the diabetes was insulin-requiring. In addition, several of the cases were found to have positive diabetes-specific antibodies, providing further evidence of the likely autoimmune etiology of the diabetes in this rare condition characterized by immunodysregulation.\nFinding biallelic P/LP variants in IL2RA in individuals with diabetes should prompt for awareness and/or screening for immune and lymphoproliferative dysfunction as well as other autoimmune problems. Similarly, in individuals discovered to have P/LP IL2RA variants but who have not been diagnosed with diabetes, glucose monitoring is advised, based on the ~60% prevalence of diabetes in this disorder. \n","*IL2RA* was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive immunodeficiency due to CD25 deficiency in 1997 (Sharfe et al., PMID: 9096364).
