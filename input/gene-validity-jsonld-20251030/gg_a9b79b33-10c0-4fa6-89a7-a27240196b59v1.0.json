{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a9b79b33-10c0-4fa6-89a7-a27240196b59v1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"The KCNQ4 gene has been associated with autosomal dominant nonsyndromic hearing loss in at least 35 probands in at least 15 publications. 25 unique missense variants, 2 in-frame deletions, and 6 truncating variants have been reported in humans, and there is segregation evidence in many families (PMID: 10369879, 28340560, 18941426, 25116015, 16596322, 26036578, 23717403, 24655070). KCNQ4 was first associated with this disease in humans in 1999 (Coucke et al.). More than enough genetic evidence is available in the literature to reach the maximum score (12 pts.). The hearing loss in patients is progressive and predominantly high-frequency, however the phenotypic spectrum may be variable. The mechanism for disease is either haploinsufficiency or dominant-negative, which is strongly supported by experimental evidence. This gene-disease association is also supported by multiple mouse models, expression evidence, and in vitro functional assays (PMID: 11042367, 24555524, 10025409, 23750663, 16437162). In summary, KCNQ4 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant nonsyndromic hearing loss. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hearing Loss Working Group on 11/21/2017.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a9b79b33-10c0-4fa6-89a7-a27240196b59","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/88196c6d-4bd7-4aff-ba98-c7b4411c562d","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/88196c6d-4bd7-4aff-ba98-c7b4411c562d_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/88196c6d-4bd7-4aff-ba98-c7b4411c562d_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2017-11-21T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/88196c6d-4bd7-4aff-ba98-c7b4411c562d_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/88196c6d-4bd7-4aff-ba98-c7b4411c562d_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/16a6073c-07fb-4220-825f-23be43b023ef","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Upgraded points because of multiple models, and strong explanation provided for mechanism of hearing loss","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a0792cb5-8770-494c-9553-f42bc7e90d59","type":"Finding","dc:description":"null mouse hearing loss progresses over a few months dominant negative over months...appears to be either dominant negative or haploinsufficiency","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16437162","rdfs:label":"KCNQ4 Mouse model","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":3}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":3},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/88196c6d-4bd7-4aff-ba98-c7b4411c562d_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/07c29009-1de6-4940-a19e-39b72ed900aa","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"1 point given for strong functional evidence","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c30e0522-d077-47b3-ab59-5cb137efd9d8","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Cell surface expression, but not conductance, could be rescued by overexpression of a gene that controls KCNQ4 biogenesis","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23750663","rdfs:label":"HEK293 dominant negative on WT channel"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a0f502dc-3b9c-4532-b1e2-08c9e98d33c9","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cee02135-0b61-4e84-9a61-6b4805c5f225","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Provides explanation for genotype phenotype correlation between missense and truncating variants.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10025409","rdfs:label":"Missense dominant negative"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/88196c6d-4bd7-4aff-ba98-c7b4411c562d_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9b456424-33fe-46f4-8021-db34f3eeb733","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f165b002-1ec2-4187-be33-5008a09e08f1","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Rat KCNQ4 ortholog is expressed in both inner and outer hair cells.
