One unique frameshift variant that has been reported in one proband in one publication is included in this curation. The proband also had a homozygous variant in *ALG10B*, which could not be ruled out as a contributing factor to the proband’s phenotype. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by a yeast model (Burda et al, PMID: 9597543) showing that *ALG10* is required for the terminal glucosylation step of the lipid-linked core oligosaccharide. In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation GCEP on the meeting date April 3, 2025 (SOP Version 11).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/03ef8d50-701b-42e5-ae9c-4d442f61ccac","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/477a729b-ac93-4873-8c3e-ba95d1080381","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/477a729b-ac93-4873-8c3e-ba95d1080381_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10135","date":"2025-04-11T20:37:28.126Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/477a729b-ac93-4873-8c3e-ba95d1080381_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10135","date":"2025-04-03T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/477a729b-ac93-4873-8c3e-ba95d1080381_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/477a729b-ac93-4873-8c3e-ba95d1080381_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3479dae4-1efb-4694-bb9a-d8f2f21d561f","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Only able to show a glycosylation defect, not a growth defect.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/01629cb4-ae2c-431e-a92f-775e6bbb0d11","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Alg10 mutations lead to underglycosylation of carboxypeptidase (fig 1a).
