Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in molecular mechanism, inheritance pattern, and phenotypic variability. Therefore, the following disease entities have been lumped into one disease entity: Congenital heart defect (CHD) and left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Two variants (a missense and a nonsense variant) that have been reported in two probands in two publications (PMIDs: 32368696, 33084842) are included in this curation. Although *BCL9* is nearly constrained for loss of function based on its z-score, more evidence is needed to confirm the mechanism of disease for this gene. No experimental evidence supporting the role of BCL9 in autosomal dominant CHD was found. In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Congenital Heart Disease GCEP on the meeting date 9/11/23 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cf54bb17-8639-45c0-9c3a-3075fc12615f","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7f45b6e5-4286-40d2-aadf-9b15a62c26df","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7f45b6e5-4286-40d2-aadf-9b15a62c26df_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10130","date":"2023-09-18T18:11:35.425Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7f45b6e5-4286-40d2-aadf-9b15a62c26df_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10130","date":"2023-09-11T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7f45b6e5-4286-40d2-aadf-9b15a62c26df_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/916000c0-cb13-481f-b776-6e2d677040da","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Downgrading as gene does not show constraint for pLOF variants, although it is close to being constrained based on the upper bound of the observed/expected ratio for the z-score.
