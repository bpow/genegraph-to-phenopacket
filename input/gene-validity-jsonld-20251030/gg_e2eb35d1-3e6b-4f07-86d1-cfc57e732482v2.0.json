Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome 9 is a subtype of HPS, characterized by oculocutaneous albinism and platelet dysfunction. *BLOC1S6* encodes the coiled-coil-forming protein, Pallidin, a subunit of the Biogenesis of Lysosome-related Organelles Complex 1, BLOC-1, which is required for normal biogenesis of specialized organelles of the endosomal-lysosomal system, such as melanosomes and platelet dense granules (PMID: 15102850). Of the 8 subunits of BLOC-1, mutations in three, including BLOC1S6, are reported in association with HPS subtypes in humans (Huizing et al., Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome, GeneReviews). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level and experimental data.\n\nSummary of Case Level Data (9 points):\nSix variants (nonsense, frameshift, and missense) in this gene have been reported in at least 5 probands in 5 publications (PMID: 22461475, 29054114, 26575419, 32245340, 33543539).  \n\nThe mechanism for disease is expected to be biallelic loss of function.  \n\nSummary of Experimental Data (3 points):\nThis gene-disease association is supported by studies of protein interaction with other subunits of BLOC-1 and by the spontaneously occurring mouse mutation, “pallid” that recapitulates the HPS phenotype. \n\nIn summary, *BLOC1S6* is definitively associated with autosomal recessive Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome 9. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.\nThis gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the HT GCEP on 09/23/2020. It was reevaluated on 05/25/2022. As a result of this reevaluation, the classification changed from Moderate to Definitive due to a new case report (PMID: 33543539).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e2eb35d1-3e6b-4f07-86d1-cfc57e732482","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/984682a2-afb9-48b3-afe8-20e0f633022d","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":[{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},{"id":"cg:classificationChange"},{"id":"cg:newEvidence"},{"id":"cg:sopChange"},{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/984682a2-afb9-48b3-afe8-20e0f633022d_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2022-05-25T16:55:16.466Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/984682a2-afb9-48b3-afe8-20e0f633022d_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2022-05-25T16:55:24.844Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/984682a2-afb9-48b3-afe8-20e0f633022d_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/984682a2-afb9-48b3-afe8-20e0f633022d_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/930af964-d0df-4a5c-9467-d13b6d2b2418","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"BLOC1S3 and Dysbindin (DTNBP1) are also implicated in HPS subtype 8 and 7, respectively.","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b9f9cc1f-4273-472a-bf3e-cccf634a61e1","type":"Finding","dc:description":"BLOC-1 protein was immunoprecipitated from metabolically labeled HeLa cells using antibodies to BLOC1S6, Dysbindin, BLOC1S2 or BLOC1S3.
