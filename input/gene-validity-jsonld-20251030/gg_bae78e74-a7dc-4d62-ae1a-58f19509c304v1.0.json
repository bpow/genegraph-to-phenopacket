HPS3 was first reported in relation to Hermasky-Pudlak syndrome 3 in 2001 (Anikster, 2001, PMID: 11455388; Huizing, 2001, PMID: 11590544). At least 19 unique variants including nonsense, splice site, frameshift and large deletions have been reported in humans. Missense variants are not very common. HPS3 is involved in organelle biogenesis associated with melanosomes, platelet dense granules, and lysosomes. Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome 3 is characterized by a mild phenotype compared to HPS1, with minimal hypopigmentation, ocular rather than oculocutaneous albinism and a mild bleeding diathesis (PMID: 20301464). It is generally not associated with pulmonary fibrosis or granulomatous colitis. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, family data and experimental data.  \n  \nSummary of Case Level Data: 12 Points \nVariants in this gene have been reported in at least 7 probands in 5 publications (PMID: 11455388, 11590544, 28284561, 27593200, 30791930). Variants in the gene segregated with 4 additional family members (PMID: 11455388). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts) has been reached. \n  \nThe mechanism for disease is homozygous loss of function (PMID: 20301464)  \t \n  \nSummary of Experimental Data: 5 Points \nThis gene-disease association is supported by mouse models and in vitro functional assays. The \"cocoa\" or \"coa\" mouse that carries at least 4 diferent spontaneously occurring mutations in the mouse Hps3 gene recapitulates the human HPS phenotype (PMID: 11707070, 14718540). HPS3 interacts with HPS5 and HPS6 to form BLOC-2, which is involved in the biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles (PMID: 15675963, 15632015, 15030569, 14718540).  \n\nIn summary, HPS3 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive Hermasky-Pudlak syndrome 3. \nThis has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hemostasis/Thrombosis GCEP on February 26, 2020 (SOP Version 6).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bae78e74-a7dc-4d62-ae1a-58f19509c304","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/80370671-df62-4330-89f4-216d350e5958","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/80370671-df62-4330-89f4-216d350e5958_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2020-02-26T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/80370671-df62-4330-89f4-216d350e5958_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/80370671-df62-4330-89f4-216d350e5958_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/80370671-df62-4330-89f4-216d350e5958_seg_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/45a7a695-2ad3-49b5-833e-c6ca2ee4246e_proband_segregation","type":"FamilyCosegregation","dc:description":"The study involved 6 families, with 2 of them (Families A and C) having more than 3 affected individuals.

HPS2 was not analyzed as the proband did not show any signs of immune deficiency.","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0511517e-5794-4710-b4b2-2c435611fc9f_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28284561","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d247249c-9962-400a-baf9-e74d6de2521e","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NC_000003.12:g.149167215del","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA913203481"}}}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/80370671-df62-4330-89f4-216d350e5958_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/80370671-df62-4330-89f4-216d350e5958_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/80decade-88ab-48e1-bb4b-62cdd2b03c47","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The model evidence is scored increased points as four different spontaneous mutations are identified as causative of HPS3 in mice, which show a bleeding phenotype and a deficiency of dense granules.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1b711aca-cc02-455f-bb8f-ab1c2137d3a0","type":"Finding","dc:description":"The cocoa mouse is a spontaneously mutated murine model of Hermansky Pudlak syndrome 3, characterized by diluted coat color.\n\nMelanocyte line established from homozygous cocoa mice show little visible pigment with barely resolved melanosomes compared to normal melanocytes.
