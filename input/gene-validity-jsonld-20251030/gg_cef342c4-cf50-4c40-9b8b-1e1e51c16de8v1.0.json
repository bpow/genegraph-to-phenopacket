More than 100 pathogenic variants in this gene are reported in humans, ranging from deletions and duplications, nonsense, frameshift and splicing variants to a number of functionally-characterized missense variants. Factor VII deficiency is characterized by a bleeding diathesis, with an increased prothrombin time, but normal activated partial thromboplastin time, reduced Factor VII activity and antigen levels. Summary of Case Level Data (12 points): Variants in this gene are reported in at least 9 probands in 6 publications (PMIDs: 8652821, 11091194, 22628013, 10959697, 23141848, 11529858). More case-level evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence has been reached. The mechanism for disease is homozygous loss of function. Summary of Experimental Data (4.5 points): FVII is involved in the blood coagulation pathway and functions to activate FX in complex with Tissue Factor (PMID: 3286010). Mouse models recapitulate the human bleeding phenotype, but bleeding is more severe in mice (PMID: 9384381). AAV-mediated expression of FVII is shown to rescue bleeding in dog models (PMID: 26702064). In summary, the F7-Factor VII deficiency gene-disease relationship is Definitive. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cef342c4-cf50-4c40-9b8b-1e1e51c16de8","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/43fb4e99-e97a-4d9c-af11-79c2b09ecd2e","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/43fb4e99-e97a-4d9c-af11-79c2b09ecd2e_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/43fb4e99-e97a-4d9c-af11-79c2b09ecd2e_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2019-07-24T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/43fb4e99-e97a-4d9c-af11-79c2b09ecd2e_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/86405715-1476-4c81-85fb-95088e27fe24_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The proband was found to be a compound heterozygote for two variants: one that destroys a splice donor site and expected to skip exon 4, and the other a missense variant that was functionally characterized. The wild-type FVII and variant FVII were expressed in CHO cells and a pulse-chase experiment performed to study whether the variant was impaired in FVII biosynthesis or if the molecule was rapidly cleared from circulation. \n\nFactor VII cDNA (with a 3' EcoRI site and its first 221 bp replaced to add a SalI site at the 5' end) was cloned into the pEDmtx plasmid (a dicistronic mRNA mammalian expression vector carrying the DHFR gene at the 3' ORF) to generate pEDFVII-WT. The recombinant FVII Thr419Met (Thr359Met in legacy numbering) was constructed by cloning a PCR fragment of exon 8 from the proband into the PT7-BlueT vector. The last 523 bp of exon and 21 bp of the 3' UTR from PT7-exon8 were used to replace 1.5kb fragment from the pEDFVII-WT to generate the pEDFVIIT359M. DHFR-deficient CHO cells (CHO-DUKX-B11) were transfected with the recombinant vectors and stable transfectants chosen for further analysis.\n\npEDFVII-WT transfectants secreted FVII as measured by FVII:C and FVII:Ag and western blot assays. Pulse-chase experiment with S-35 labeled methionine showed that the recombinant FVII protein accumulated within the cell for up to 60 minutes after synthesis. Incubation of cell lysates, after the pulse-chase experiment up to a time point of 120 minutes, with Endo H showed partial  acquisition of resistance to Endo H by 30 minutes, which increased subsequently, reflecting the protein processing in the ER and maturation in the Golgi compartment. \n\npEDFVIIT359M showed FVII mRNA in transfected cells. Pulse-chase experiment with S-35 methionine showed that FVIIT359M was accumulated intracellularly and no protein was detected in the supernatant after 45 minutes of chase. Further, FVIIT359M accumulated as an endo H sensitive species, retained within the ER. A small amount of endo H-resistant FVII was detected at all time points, \nIndicating that at least some of the mutant protein is able to reach the Golgi. \n\nThe authors conclude that the splice site variant is predicted to result in abnormal splicing and, as a result, skipping of exon 4 which encodes the first EGF domain of the molecule. This variant is seen at a frequency of  0.00008678 in Latinos and an overall frequency of 0.00001992 with no homozygotes. The missense change, Thr419Met, occurs in the catalytic domain and has been characterized in detail and shown to result in FVII with reduced activity, in this paper. This variant is reported at an overall frequency of 0.00001208 in gnomAD with the maximum 0.00005472 in East Asians. No homozygotes are reported.  \n\nThe Arg413Gln (Arg353Gln in paper) missense (ClinVar: 12080, benign) was found to be a common variant with a frequency of 10% in the US and UK and was associated with 75% FVII:C in heterozygotes and 50% FVII:C in homozygotes.

Knockdown of HNF4 was efficient (50% using densitometric analysis), while that of COUP-TF1 was less marked (30%), explained due to the low levels of expression of COUP-TF1 protein in hepatic tissue.\n\nCompared to the significant increase in luciferase activity observed in the wild-type context, a significant decrease (30%) was observed with the –60_-59delTT variant.\n\nThe authors conclude that the data confirm the negative effect that the –60_-59delTT variant has on F7 promoter activity and suggest a critical role for HNF4 transcription factor binding.\n\nThe variant is not reported in gnomAD. It is scored default points (and not higher points) since the variant was not confirmed to be in trans in the proband.","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9f75a7d2-9e88-4f3d-b587-49693f85ad01","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22628013","rdfs:label":"Giansily_Proband2","ageType":"AgeAtDiagnosis","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":8,"detectionMethod":"The nine exons, the intron-exon boundaries and the 5’-untranslated region of the F7 gene were PCR-amplified and direct DNA sequencing was performed.","firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypeFreeText":"Recurrent intracranial hemorrhages at 2 months, convulsive attacks, treated with FFP, but died from massive intracranial hemorrhage.","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0000238","obo:HP_0001342","obo:HP_0002170"],"previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"FVII:C = 7% and FVII:Ag = 6%; samples drawn after FFP infusion and might reflect residual infused FVII altering the basal FVII levels.","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/25aa272f-a7ce-4e6a-871b-074bda179c9b_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22628013","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e5d96c38-f5f3-42ee-ac55-5944ea89ad09","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NC_000013.11:g.113105782_113105783del","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA891862601"}}}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5c042c40-a7aa-4c34-a2da-01120180c6fb_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The missense variant has been previously reported and is identified in the homozygous state in the proband and two other unrelated individuals.

No embryonic lethality 100% survival with Mendelian inheritance, which were not accounted for by differences in genetic background. However, 70% of the FVII−/− neonates suffered fatal intra-abdominal bleeding within the first 24 h whereas most of the remaining neonates died from intracranial haemorrhage before the age of 24 days. \n\nWidespread blood collection in the peritoneal or subdural cavities was seen on microscopy. Blood vessel development was normal, with intact vWF immunoreactive endothelium and numerous α-actin-positive smooth muscle cells. Other components of the intrinsic or extrinsic coagulation cascade di not compensate for the loss of FVII:C. In FVII+/- neonates, ~10% of adult plasma FVII levels was protective against bleeding. \n\nBased on the observation that FVII immunoreactivity was absent in the E9.5 FVII+/+ embryo, but became progressively more abundant in the P2 and adult liver, the authors tried to detect maternal-fetal transfer of FVII. FVII:C in plasma of embryos was determined at different embryonic ages. FVII:C was undetectable in FVII-/- embryos, but it progressively increased to ~30% of adult levels in wild-type. Further investigation using human rFVIIa injected into pregnant females and measuring it with a human rFVIIa-specific ELISA showed that transfer, if any, was very low. Immunoreactive FVII was restricted to the endothelium of the maternal blood vessels and to the syncytiotrophoblast layer at the maternal-fetal interface. Embryonic blood vessels were consistently FVII-negative. Wild-type embryos cultured in the presence of the recombinant active site FVIIa-inhibitor, NAPc2, did not result in bleeding or vascular fragility, indicating that TF–FVII-initiated coagulation was not critical for vascular integrity. \n\nThe authors conclude that FVII may be essential for perinatal hemostasis,  but is not critical to embryonic development.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9384381","rdfs:label":"Rosen_Mouse","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fde4aa65-333e-40a8-875d-6156b7fc3b58","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The rescue evidence is scored default points.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/759ba4db-8e97-4b95-bd93-e3407c56886d","type":"Finding","dc:description":"The research animals with the missense variant had prothrombin clotting time of 106.4 ± 20 s (nv = 26 ± 7.2 s), <1% FVII activity, circulating FVII:Ag levels of ∼40 ng/mL (nv = 1040 ± 380 ng/mL) by ELISA and Western blot detected no circulating antigen.\n\nFollowing AAV8-cFVII administration, a reduction in the PT that reached a plateau, from 121.1 ± 1.0 s to 22.1 ± 3.2 s (with dose = 4.95E13 vg/kg) was observed.
