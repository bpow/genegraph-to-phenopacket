Of note, *AP1G1* has also been implicated in autosomal dominant complex neurodevelopmental disorder (Usmani-Riazuddin syndrome, autosomal dominant). The split curation for Usmani-Riazuddin syndrome, autosomal dominant, is assessed separately.\n\n*AP1G1*-related autosomal recessive complex neurodevelopmental disorder (also known as Usmani-Riazuddin syndrome, autosomal recessive) has been reported in three affected individuals from two unrelated consanguineous families carrying homozygous missense variants functionally characterized in cell culture and zebrafish models (PMID: 34102099). Common features in affected individuals included global developmental delay, hypotonia, speech delay, moderately to severely impaired intellectual development,  and spasticity. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence. AP1G1 interacts with other  adaptor protein complex 1 (AP-1) proteins, AP1S1/AP1S2, which have been definitively implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders. AP complexes mediate selective intracellular vesicular trafficking and polarized localization of somatodendritic proteins in neurons.\n\nIn summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel on November 2, 2022 (SOP Version 9).\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6af7b58f-6a6c-4ae2-8a4a-43f641967bbf","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d636cccc-aa9c-4927-ae40-538bf34d0620","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d636cccc-aa9c-4927-ae40-538bf34d0620_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2022-11-02T19:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d636cccc-aa9c-4927-ae40-538bf34d0620_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2024-02-19T20:59:22.265Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d636cccc-aa9c-4927-ae40-538bf34d0620_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5997e962-0c74-444d-9012-675b4e96dd25_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ee18ce18-c4ff-437c-bdf0-b101a88cb133","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1.0,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ee18ce18-c4ff-437c-bdf0-b101a88cb133_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"In
