{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/58ee9486-f2f9-45bd-ad5c-f3a3ed414ad4v1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"The relationship between HPDL and Leigh syndrome spectrum (LSS) was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of June 30, 2021. The HPDL gene encodes 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase-like protein, a putative iron-containing oxygenase. The mechanism underlying how pathogenic variants in this gene affect mitochondria and cause disease is unclear.\n\nThe HPDL gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive LSS in 2020 (PMID: 32707086). Evidence supporting the relationship between HPDL and LSS includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included nine unique variants identified in five cases from two publications (PMID: 32707086, 33970200).  Of note, variants in HPDL have also been associated with infantile-onset encephalopathy and spastic paraplegia. No segregation data were available. Loss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease association is also supported by expression and animal models (PMIDs: 18853439, 33188300).\n\nIn summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on June 30, 2021 (SOP Version 7).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/58ee9486-f2f9-45bd-ad5c-f3a3ed414ad4","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d1a484ba-cba2-4a63-8c81-7a8a41c93f9c","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d1a484ba-cba2-4a63-8c81-7a8a41c93f9c_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2021-06-30T21:58:01.685Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d1a484ba-cba2-4a63-8c81-7a8a41c93f9c_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2021-06-30T21:57:54.231Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d1a484ba-cba2-4a63-8c81-7a8a41c93f9c_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d1a484ba-cba2-4a63-8c81-7a8a41c93f9c_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6430f256-1d72-49d2-978a-3c5c93e3fcff","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"0.5pts: failure to thrive and early death\n0.5pts: reduction in growth rate","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/38845736-d09c-4dc6-9d3d-e1ba5b7719a7","type":"Finding","dc:description":"A KO mouse model was created with a a homozygous frameshift deletion of Hpdl generated using CRISPR/Cas9.\nMice are born healthy but by day 5 show lethargy and spontaneous movements suggesting of epileptic seizures.\nAlmost all KOs died by P10, and none survived to P15 (Fig. 3a).\nTheir body weights and brain size were similar at birth compared to wildtype littermates but by P9–10 the KO mice weighed approximately half that of the wiltype, CC3 staining suggested cellular apoptosis in brain tissues. \nMetabolic analysis showed no abnormal tyrosine catabolism.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33188300","rdfs:label":"HPDL KO mouse model","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d1a484ba-cba2-4a63-8c81-7a8a41c93f9c_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/437311f6-15ff-4795-9c75-ac7177f6fd82","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Default score for expression in the brain.","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/18fadab9-b1e9-4644-883a-ae3ca2a413b9","type":"Finding","dc:description":"HPDL is present in various tissues with particularly high levels in the central and peripheral nervous system (GTEx Analysis Release V.8, dbGaP Accession phs000424.v8.p2 on 03/10/2020).\nProtein Atlas: no protein expression data available.
