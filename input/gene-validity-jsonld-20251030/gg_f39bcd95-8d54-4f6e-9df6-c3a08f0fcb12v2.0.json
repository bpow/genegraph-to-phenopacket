The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss-of-function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence (mouse models, expression-level evidence; PMIDs: 17586487, 24487590). Temporal and spatial expression of TSHZ1 mRNA during development of the middle ear is consistent with the phenotype (PMID: 17586487). The homozygous TSHZ1 null mouse model showed a middle ear malformation, as well as neonatal lethality. A conditional nervous system-specific TSHZ1 knock out mouse model demonstrated hyposmia (PMIDs: 17586487, 24487590). In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship.  This GDR was originally evaluated by the Syndromic Disorders GCEP on June 19, 2020. It was reevaluated on July 23, 2024. A new phenotype, congenital vertical talus, was reported in probands, in addition to more cases of deafness (PMIDs: 35487415, 36597107). An additional two missense variants were added to the curation from two probands in one publication (PMID: 36597107). Despite new genetic evidence, as a result of this reevaluation, the classification did not change (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f39bcd95-8d54-4f6e-9df6-c3a08f0fcb12","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cfbe0bb6-f9c6-447b-bec9-911af6a67566","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","changes":[{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"},{"id":"cg:newEvidence"},{"id":"cg:sopChange"},{"id":"cg:summaryChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cfbe0bb6-f9c6-447b-bec9-911af6a67566_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10060","date":"2024-07-23T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cfbe0bb6-f9c6-447b-bec9-911af6a67566_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10060","date":"2024-10-07T21:15:38.891Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["RecurationTiming"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cfbe0bb6-f9c6-447b-bec9-911af6a67566_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b359ebb5-9d0e-4059-96b1-036ec3021d81","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b359ebb5-9d0e-4059-96b1-036ec3021d81_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36597107","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2957a988-df8b-4d99-bf52-9932832b4486","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001308210.2(TSHZ1):c.1064C>T (p.Ala355Val)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA9001944"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Heterozygous"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":0.1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/35377803-6a46-4d69-9c60-b0cc91686c00","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"truncates protein in exon 2/2, so not predicted to undergo NMD, but does truncate over 90 % of protein","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/35377803-6a46-4d69-9c60-b0cc91686c00_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35487415","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/84558943-cc59-476c-9a72-6461b2dec9d7","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001308210.2(TSHZ1):c.187_188insACCC (p.Pro63HisfsTer8)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA2740089969"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Heterozygous"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ec7b9188-1e68-4e09-8c62-e82bccc4d5a3","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Variant is absent from ClinVar; highest minor allele frequency in gnomAD is 8/126368 alleles (0.00006331) in European (non-Finnish) population (no homozyg.).
