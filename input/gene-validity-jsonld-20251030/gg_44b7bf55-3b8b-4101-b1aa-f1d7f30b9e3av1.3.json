Among patients with H syndrome, deficient *SLC29A3* function results in impaired nucleoside export from lysosomes and lysosomal accumulation of nucleosides (PMID: 22174130), which leads to histiocytic infiltration of numerous organs.

Therefore, the following disease entities have been lumped into one disease entity: H syndrome, pigmented hypertrichosis with insulin dependent diabetes mellitus syndrome (PHID), Faisalabad histiocytosis (FHC), familial sinus histiocytosis with massive lymphadenopathy (FSHML), and some forms of dysosteosclerosis. Due to overlapping symptoms, these conditions are now all lumped together as \"H syndrome\".\n\nFifteen variants (8 missense, 3 frameshift, 2 nonsense, canonical 2 splice site) that have been reported in 22 probands in 7 publications (PMIDs: 18940313, 20140240, 19336477, 19889517, 22875837, 22653152, 22238637) are included in this curation.

This classification was approved by the ClinGen Lysosomal Diseases GCEP on May 7, 2024 (SOP Version 10).\n\n**Addendum from the Monogenic Diabetes GCEP**:\nVariants in SLC29A3 were first reported in association with diabetes in the form of pigmented hypertrichosis with insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (PHID) syndrome in 2009 based on a homozygosity mapping study in six individuals in five unrelated families.  Homozygosity for two truncation variants and five missense variants was identified (PMID:19336477).  The mechanism for diabetes appears to be related to beta cell loss due to apoptosis induced by the loss of the *SLC29A3* gene product human equilibrative nucleoside transporter 3 (hENT3) (PMID:26163994).  The diabetes in PHID was originally described as predominantly antibody-negative (PMIDs:19175903,17461801).  However, a recent case series reported that 4 out of 7 patients, all diagnosed between the ages of 3 and 14 with PHID, had at least one positive antibody (PMID:38163427).  Therefore, the presence of autoantibodies should thus not preclude testing for PHID in children with diabetes in the presence of consanguinity along with features of PHID including dysmorphic facial features, characteristic skin lesions, hematological abnormalities, and developmental delay (PMID:38163427).  Individuals presenting with diabetes and found to have PHID through genetic testing are recommended to undergo early hearing and vision screening to improve neurocognitive outcomes and to be referred to a specialized dermatologist for skin lesions to prevent joint contractures (PMID:38163427).  Individuals presenting with features of SLC29A3-related disorders (H syndrome) and found to have biallelic pathogenic *SLC29A3* variants should undergo glycemic screening to enable early treatment for diabetes. This amendment was approved by the ClinGen Monogenic Diabetes GCEP on April 30, 2025.\n"],"dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/44b7bf55-3b8b-4101-b1aa-f1d7f30b9e3a","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cdde7d77-09cc-4ef2-99eb-f9acd8c8df04","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},"contributions":[{"agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10016","role":"SecondaryContributor"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cdde7d77-09cc-4ef2-99eb-f9acd8c8df04_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10110","date":["2024-05-07T16:00:00.000Z","2024-05-07T04:00:00.000Z"],"role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cdde7d77-09cc-4ef2-99eb-f9acd8c8df04_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10110","date":"2025-07-11T15:49:41.467Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["ErrorClarification"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cdde7d77-09cc-4ef2-99eb-f9acd8c8df04_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f8ebeffa-5b67-4efa-98dd-59a5de82bf6f_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f8ebeffa-5b67-4efa-98dd-59a5de82bf6f","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22653152","rdfs:label":"Farooq Family 1 Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":5,"allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/37e329f3-8ea3-4c8c-8996-36866aa49223","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_018344.6(SLC29A3):c.1+2T>G","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA377128556"}},"detectionMethod":"All 6 exons including exon-intron boundaries of the SLC29A3 gene were amplified by PCR from the genomic DNA.

However, this is similar to the human hypertrichosis phenotype which occurs in restricted, rather stereotyped areas, and not over the entire body. Wings were studied to investigate insulin signaling component interactions, which are known to regulate cell growth and proliferation. When dENT1 expression was knocked down in the dorsal wing disk, an up-curved wing phenotype resulted, indicating a reduction of cell size or proliferation in the dorsum of the wing. The reduction of cell size/number could be rescued or enhanced by manipulation of the Drosophila insulin receptor and its downstream signaling effectors, dPI3K and dAkt. Thus, this gene in fruitflies plays a role in the insulin signaling pathway, which is similar to inactivating mutations in SLC29A3 causing a syndromic form of insulin-dependent diabetes in humans.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19336477","rdfs:label":"Drosophila Insulin Signaling and Bristle Studies","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4359ee5d-b782-46c7-a0bf-b01b04157c67","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Many phenotypes consistent with human disease both at the organ and cellular levels.
