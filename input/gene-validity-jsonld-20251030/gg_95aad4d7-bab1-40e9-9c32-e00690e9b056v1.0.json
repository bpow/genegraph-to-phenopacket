Two variants (missense) that have been reported in a single proband (PMID 34468083) are included in this curation. Symptoms including global developmental delay, mild coarse facial features, and short stature were reported. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This gene-disease relationship is supported by in vitro and in vivo assays showing a defect in fucosylation (PMIDs 34468083) as well as a mouse model (PMID 12186857). In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Congenital Disorder of Glycosylation Expert Panel on the meeting date 8//7/2025 (SOP Version 11).
