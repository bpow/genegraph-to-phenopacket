Verheij syndrome is associated with developmental and intellectual impairments, short stature, skeletal abnormalities, feeding issues, joint laxity, renal and cardiac anomalies, coloboma, and facial dysmorphisms. A subsequent publication reported on additional probands with 8q24.3 deletions, further characterized the gene content in the region, and suggested, via zebrafish models, that the genes *PUF60* (encoding a component of the spliceosome that plays a role in RNA processing) and *SCRIB* contribute to Verheij syndrome phenotypes (Dauber et al., 2013; PMID: 24140112). In that publication, a missense *PUF60* variant shown to cause loss of function via functional studies was reported in a proband with similar clinical features (Dauber et al., 2013; PMID: 24140112). \n\nSince that time, additional publications have described individuals with variants in the *PUF60* gene. Clinical features in affected individuals with *PUF60* sequence variants are similar to those of individuals with Verheij syndrome and 8q24.3 deletions. However, the expert panel elected to curate *PUF60* for syndromic intellectual disability given the potential that *SCRIB* or other genes in the region may contribute to Verheij syndrome.  \n\nAt least 29 probands with *PUF60* variants have been reported in the literature. At least 19 unique nonsense, canonical splice-site, and frameshift variants have been reported in 20 probands (PMIDs: 27479843, 27804958, 28074499, 28327570, 28990276, 30078240, 30352594, 33418956) and 7 unique missense variants have been reported in 9 probands (PMIDs: 24140112, 27804958, 28074499, 28327570, 28471317, 29300383, 30569551). Missense variants cluster in the RNA recognition motifs (PMID: 30352594). The mechanism of pathogenicity is loss of function. Variants are de novo in all probands. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. This gene-disease association is also supported by experimental evidence including a zebrafish model (PMID: 24140112), rescue in zebrafish (PMID: 24140112), functional alteration in non-patient cells (PMID: 24140112), and rescue in cell culture (PMID: 24140112). \n\nIn summary, *PUF60* is definitively associated with autosomal dominant syndromic intellectual disability. This classification was approved by the Intellectual Disability and Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel on 12/15/2021 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3cf07a03-f7ac-4ecd-b9ff-bb072f28500e","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/661c140f-11a3-46f8-b001-14a2314582e4","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/661c140f-11a3-46f8-b001-14a2314582e4_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2021-12-15T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/661c140f-11a3-46f8-b001-14a2314582e4_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2022-06-09T14:03:58.681Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/661c140f-11a3-46f8-b001-14a2314582e4_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8b5f0afe-4f77-456b-9995-d85a7b9e67b3","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8b5f0afe-4f77-456b-9995-d85a7b9e67b3_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28327570","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b89b7fef-9ae4-439e-aa41-25b7ab564e4e","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_078480.3(PUF60):c.604-2A>G","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA372491128"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:DeNovoAlleleOrigin"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:Heterozygous"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/47c81e35-8e94-4036-a058-f1eda25543fa","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Because genome-wide testing methods  were not used to identify the variant(s) described in this proband, the variant was not upgraded for de novo status.

Splicing of three puf60 targets (BIN1, APP, and SMN2) was then assessed. Knockdown showed significant changes to these genes' splicing profiles.  The authors then tested whether plasmids expressing wild-type or His169Tyr puf60 would rescue the phenotype. The splicing changes observed could be rescued by wild-type but not mutant PUF60. \n\nSecond, the authors extracted whole-blood RNA from the individual with the p.His169Tyr variant and three patients with 8q24.3 deletions and phenotypes consistent with Verheij syndrome. The splicing pattern of BIN1, APP, and SMN2 was affected in all probands with the deletion and the patient with p.His169Tyr. Skipping of exon 5 occurred more frequently in the patient with this missense variant compared to control family members. As such, the proband produced less on the long isoform of PUF60. \n\nFinally, the authors engineered the long and short isoforms of PUF60 with the p.His169Tyr variant. Zebrafish were coinjected with puf60 MO and either wild-type puf60 or a mutant mRNA. Zebrafish injected only with puf60 MO showed decreased body length. The body length phenotype was rescued with the wild-type and long isoform mutant mRNA with the p.His169Tyr variant. The phenotype was not rescued in those with the short isoform mRNA with the p.His169Tyr variant. The authors assert that these findings along with in vitro data support that the p.His169Tyr variant causes loss of function and a bias towards production of the short isoform.
