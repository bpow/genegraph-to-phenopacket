Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, this gene-disease association was split from the FOXI1- enlarged vestibular aqueduct syndrome (EVA) association due to phenotypic concordance with the mouse model (Hulander et al., PMID:9843211). The split curation for autosomal recessive EVA has been curated separately.  Additionally, digenic inheritance with variants in FOXI1 and SLC26A4 has been proposed in association with autosomal recessive enlarged vestibular aqueduct syndrome, which has been split in its own curation and is currently disputed (Yang et al. 2007 PMID:17503324). At least 2 missense variants have been reported in humans. Association is seen in at least 2 probands in 1 publication (PMID: 29242249). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 1 additional family member. The mechanism for disease is unknown. The gene-disease association is also supported by a homozygous FOXI1 null mouse (PMID:9843211). Homozygous null mice were profoundly deaf with vestibular symptoms and histological examination of the inner ear revealed profound deformation. In summary, due to minimal genetic evidence in humans, there is limited evidence to support the FOXI1 and AR syndromic genetic deafness and renal tubular acidosis association. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease association. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hearing Loss Working Group on 2/27/2018. It was re-evaluated on 3/16/2022. As a result of this reevaluation, the classification did not change, and no new additional information was added to the curation.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9929d920-ecf7-4a06-bf30-6e3e35a34294","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0bb41557-8ccc-4084-b4b0-d4ede42d8f36","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","changes":{"id":"cg:sopChange"},"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0bb41557-8ccc-4084-b4b0-d4ede42d8f36_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2023-01-23T21:07:02.993Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0bb41557-8ccc-4084-b4b0-d4ede42d8f36_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2022-03-16T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0bb41557-8ccc-4084-b4b0-d4ede42d8f36_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0bb41557-8ccc-4084-b4b0-d4ede42d8f36_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3de0237b-88f6-4fc2-833c-812767bd1c5c","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bb29c89e-9a28-47d4-9c2f-fb6fac3cfe07","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Refers to FOXI1 as Fkh10.
