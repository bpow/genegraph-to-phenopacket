Though not the phenotype that is being curated here, PAX7 was first reported in 2017 in relation to an autosomal recessive neurodevelopmental condition with seizures in a pair of consanguineous siblings with a homozygous extended splice donor variant predicted to impact the last exon of isoform 3 only (Proskorovski-Ohayon et al., 2017, PMID: 28779497). We are curating the phenotype reported in 2019, where PAX7 was associated with autosomal recessive congenital myopathy with myasthenic-like onset, in a cohort of five patients from four consanguineous families with features including hypotonia, skeletal muscle atrophy, progressive scoliosis, and mild dysmorphic features (Feichtinger et al., 2019, PMID: 31092906). Additional features found in some patients included congenital contractures, growth deficiency, respiratory insufficiency and ptosis. These individuals generally presented at or shortly after birth, displayed a progressive myopathy and were not reported to have intellectual disability. The mechanism of disease is reported to be loss of function. Four variants were reported in a homozygous state (2 stop-gain, 1 splice acceptor, 1 missense) in five individuals (PMID: 31092906). Notably, all of these variants are located within the paired box (PD) domain, which is present in all three human isoforms of PAX7. \nThis gene disease association is further supported by expression studies performed in mice which demonstrate the upregulation of PAX7 expression in quiescent satellite cells following satellite cell activation following muscle stimulation or trauma (PMIDs: 11030621, 24065826, 31092906). Additionally, PAX7- deficient mouse models recapitulate several aspects of the reported phenotype including postnatal myopathy, impaired motor skills, growth deficiency and malformation of the maxilla and nose (PMID: 8631261, 11030621). Tissue specific knock-out of PAX7 in mouse myoblasts has been shown to result in depletion of satellite cells and defective myogenesis following injury with cardiotoxin (PMID: 24065826). In summary, there is moderate evidence to support the association of PAX7 with autosomal recessive congenital myopathy with myasthenic-like onset. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged. \nThis gene-disease pair was originally evaluated as Moderate by the ClinGen Syndromic Disorders Gene Curation Expert Panel on the meeting date September 18th, 2020 as per SOP v7. It was reevaluated on March 31st, 2024. This record underwent an update in scoring to be consistent with SOP v10. No new evidence has been reviewed or added. As a result of this reevaluation, the classification did not change.\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/40200c47-409a-4114-bcd7-b348481f8430","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/684596b8-b8c4-40e5-8ab6-8b23cac49be5","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Strong","changes":[{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"},{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},{"id":"cg:sopChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/684596b8-b8c4-40e5-8ab6-8b23cac49be5_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10060","date":"2024-10-07T20:17:02.362Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/684596b8-b8c4-40e5-8ab6-8b23cac49be5_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10060","date":"2024-03-31T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"Although sufficient points were awarded to reach a score of \"Strong\", given that only 4 cases from a single publication were deemed scorable in relation to the congenital myopathy phenotype, a classification of \"Moderate\" was assigned.

Additionally, expression of PAX3, which plays a similar role to PAX7 in fetal development, and MYH3, a marker of muscle regeneration, wer increased in both cases compared to controls. Expression of additional myogenic factors differed between cases and controls (figure 3b).\n\nProtein expression: Immunostaining results: cells co-espressing PAX7 and MYF5 were not detectable in either patient sample. Desmin-expressing activated myogenic cells and cells expressing phosphohistone H3 (H3P), a marker of mitosis, were detected in both samples, but at reduced levels compared to controls. MYH3, a marker of muscle regeneration, was observed in both patient samples but was absent in control samples. The number of nuclei per myofiber was also significantly reduced in patient samples, suggesting a lack of myogenic cells.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31092906","rdfs:label":"PAX7 expression in patients","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionB"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/911466d3-6bc1-4eb7-a8b7-072569281771","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/78604962-9d55-48e2-a4f4-50808e946cf4","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Pax7 expression was evaluated in cells from several mouse tissue types using Northern blot and analysis of Poly(A) RNA.

All cells infected with Ad-Cre showed complete loss of Pax7 expression, growth arrest, no proliferation after 6 days in culture and no increase in apoptosis, but could undergo normal differentiation.  Cells treated with a control adenovirus and WT cells treated with Ad-Cre underwent a 50-fold expansion during the same interval.\nThe ability of Pax7-deficient satelite cells on cultured single myofibers to proliferate and differentiate evaluated using siRNA-mediated knockdown. After 72 hours, the number of satellite cells was decreased by 2.4 fold, and the number of multicell clusters decreased by 3.5 fold. The number of satellite cells expressing myogenin, a maker of differentiation, increased by 2.6 fold. \nPax7 deficient satellite from partial and complete PAX7 conditional knockouts are phenotyped following injury with cardiotoxin. At 10 days post-injury, a 2.1 fold reduction in the number of regenerated myofibers, increased in the numbers of interstitial cells and reduced muscle weight was observed in complete knock outs compared to control cells. At 21 days post treatment, severe regeneration defects complete knock outs including extensive deposition of adipose tissues, fibrotic tissue and calcium deposits. These defects were more pronounce in samples that received a second dose of cardiotoxin. Cells in which Pax7 was partially knocked down showed milder abnormalities.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24065826","rdfs:label":"Cells from PAX7 conditional knock-out mice","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":5.5}],"evidenceStrength":"Moderate","sequence":9145,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria10","strengthScore":13.6,"subject":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/uVWVrPasV9U","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0018528","gene":"hgnc:8621","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"2.0","websiteLegacyID":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/assertion_684596b8-b8c4-40e5-8ab6-8b23cac49be5-","@context":{"@vocab":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"},"curationReasons":{"@type":"@vocab","@container":"@set"},"GCISnapshot":{"@type":"@id"},"dc:isVersionOf":{"@type":"@id"},"websiteLegacyID":{"@type":"@id"}}}
