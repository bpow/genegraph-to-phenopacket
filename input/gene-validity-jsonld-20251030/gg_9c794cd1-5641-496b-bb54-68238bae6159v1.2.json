This skeletal dysplasia is characterized by early-onset, progressive pseudorheumatoid arthritis, platyspondyly, and short third and fourth toes (Marik et al., PMID: 14730409; Kozlowski et al., PMID: 15266623). 1 variant (NM_001844.5:c.823C>T (p.Arg275Cys)) that has been reported in 17 probands in 15 publications (PMIDs: 7738948, 8244341, 8877930, 14730409, 15266623, 15593085, 16155195, 16755660, 17726487, 18553548, 19764028, 21990059, 23448908, 23928235, 32071555) are included in this curation meeting phenotypic criteria for early-onset, progressive pseudorheumatoid arthritis, platyspondyly, and short third and fourth toes. Notably, *COL2A1* has been definitively associated with Achondrogenesis type 2-hypochondrogenesis, Platyspondylic dysplasia, Spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita, Kniest dysplasia, and spondyloperipheral dysplasia after curation by the ClinGen Skeletal Disorders GCEP. This gene has also been associated with Stickler syndrome type I and Dysplasia of the proximal femoral epiphyses (PMID: 31633310), which will be assessed separately. *COL2A1*-related SED with metatarsal shortening is most frequently caused by the c.823C>T (p.Arg275Cys) variant, located at a mutational hot spot in the C-propeptide of *COL2A1* specific to SED with metatarsal shortening. This gene-disease association is also supported by experimental evidence (expression studies) (PMIDs: 3033664, 7806485). *COL2A1* is shown to be expressed in the marrow cells, osteoblasts, fibroblasts and some osteocytes, chondrocytes in the otic capsule, and the extracellular matrix surrounding chondrocytes in cartilage. In summary, *COL2A1* is moderately associated with autosomal dominant SED with metatarsal shortening (formerly known as Czech dysplasia). This classification was approved by the Skeletal Disorders Gene Curation Expert Panel on 12/6/21 (SOP version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9c794cd1-5641-496b-bb54-68238bae6159","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/29a041e5-bac4-4f88-9dda-ac44b00a92ca","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","changes":{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/29a041e5-bac4-4f88-9dda-ac44b00a92ca_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10065","date":"2023-09-28T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/29a041e5-bac4-4f88-9dda-ac44b00a92ca_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10065","date":"2023-09-28T20:29:39.017Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["ErrorClarification"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/29a041e5-bac4-4f88-9dda-ac44b00a92ca_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/29a041e5-bac4-4f88-9dda-ac44b00a92ca_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0bb9eb71-bf71-438a-8941-352fa59a0427","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b5c71833-da5d-4497-a95b-49d3bafa692f","type":"Finding","dc:description":"In situ hybridization of fetal human tissues revealed COL2A1 expression in marrow cells, osteoblasts, fibroblasts and some osteocytes, in addition to chondrocytes in otic capsule.
