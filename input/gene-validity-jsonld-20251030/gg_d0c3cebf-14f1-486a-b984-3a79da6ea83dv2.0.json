At least 14 unique variants (missense and frameshift) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 12 probands in 8 publications (PMIDs: 26610677, 26960553, 25152457, 17436247, 29269105, 28600779, 31903955, 32579715). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 3 additional family member. This gene-disease association is supported by the biochemical function of PSAT1 as a phosphoserine aminotransferase (PMID: 12633500), its tissue enhanced expression in the brain (PMID: 12633500), and a knockout mouse model (PMID: 27626380). Of note, this gene has been implicated in two neurometabolic disorders due to serine deficiency, phosphoserine aminotransferase deficiency and Neu-Laxova syndrome. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no reported difference in molecular mechanisms or inheritance pattern and current assertions in the field suggest one broad phenotypic spectrum associated with serine biosynthesis defects encompassing both disorders (PMIDs: 28653176, 27161889, 26960553, 25152457). Therefore, all of the disease entities have been lumped into one disease entity, neurometabolic disorder due to serine deficiency. In summary, PSAT1 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive neurometabolic disorder due to serine deficiency.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d0c3cebf-14f1-486a-b984-3a79da6ea83d","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ca702099-7dc9-4434-b661-a6f9b8c72d5c","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":[{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},{"id":"cg:newEvidence"},{"id":"cg:classificationChange"},{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"},{"id":"cg:sopChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ca702099-7dc9-4434-b661-a6f9b8c72d5c_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10011","date":"2020-09-16T19:23:17.624Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ca702099-7dc9-4434-b661-a6f9b8c72d5c_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10011","date":"2020-06-29T16:56:56.452Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ca702099-7dc9-4434-b661-a6f9b8c72d5c_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ca702099-7dc9-4434-b661-a6f9b8c72d5c_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/edb131f3-2ed7-4846-83a2-aeb4505c8ec9","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"High levels of mRNA expression were observed in the brain which is a highly affected tissue in neurometabolic disorder due to serine deficiency (with common phenotypes including microcephaly and intellectual disability).
