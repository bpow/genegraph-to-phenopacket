The relationship between APOB and hypercholesterolemia (autosomal dominant) was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework. Variants in APOB were first reported in humans with hypercholesterolemia as early as 1989 (Soria et al., PMID: 2563166). At least 7 variants (missense) in at least 13 probands in 6 publications been reported in humans (PMIDs: 24498611, 24234650, 15135245, 22408029, 2563166, 7627691). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in at least 41 family members. This gene-disease relationship has been studied in at least 1 case-control study at the single variant level with an odds ratio of 78 (95% CI 16-388, p=0.0001) (PMID: 9603795). The mechanism for disease involves mainly heterozygous missense variants resulting in defective apo B100 on LDL particles that fails to bind to LDLR (PMID: 29219151). The gene-disease association is also supported by in vitro studies and animal models. In summary, APOB is definitively associated with autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen General Gene Curation EP on 11/14/2018.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a37db2c2-4c15-4364-b56b-2437b415ac39","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1c26b83b-409e-47c7-9c53-6ca79472d6fc","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":[{"id":"cg:sopChange"},{"id":"cg:expertPanelChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1c26b83b-409e-47c7-9c53-6ca79472d6fc_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10026","date":"2018-11-14T18:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10018","role":"SecondaryContributor"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1c26b83b-409e-47c7-9c53-6ca79472d6fc_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10026","date":"2020-09-16T19:23:17.578Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1c26b83b-409e-47c7-9c53-6ca79472d6fc_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1c26b83b-409e-47c7-9c53-6ca79472d6fc_cc_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d31a1a19-98a8-49d1-9b48-9edc1b9d7591","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d31a1a19-98a8-49d1-9b48-9edc1b9d7591_cc_evidence_item","type":"Finding","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9603795","rdfs:label":"Tybjaerg-Hansen Case-Control","caseCohort":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/42e72c2b-bf14-4942-a038-9d8e0daed52d","type":"Cohort","allGenotypedSequenced":36,"alleleFrequency":0.05555555555555555,"detectionMethod":"Presence of Arg3500Gln  was determined in pooled samples by PCR: looked for mutation specific band.
