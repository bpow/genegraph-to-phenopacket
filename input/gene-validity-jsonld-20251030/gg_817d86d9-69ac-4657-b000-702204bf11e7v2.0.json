In available literature, variants in *CACNB4* have been reported in relation to episodic ataxia type 5, juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, and idiopathic generalized epilepsy. This gene was originally analyzed in June 2018 and was disputed at the time of curation due to a lack of clinical evidence to support the gene-disease relationship. In July 2022, *CACNB4* was recurated by the ClinGen Epilepsy Gene Curation Expert Panel. \n\nSince the original curation, contradictory evidence has emerged. In 2019, Heyne et al (PMID:31056551) evaluated variants reportedly associated with neurodevelopmental disorders that were also included on gene panels targeted for epilepsy from 2013 to 2017. Authors compared variant frequencies of the genes compared to controls. As a result, *CACNB4* showed identical frequencies of ultra-rare variants in cases compared to the controls. This evidence demonstrates that removing a gene with no diagnostic yield, such as *CACNB4*, from panels would increase diagnostic yield over time and this publication has been utilized as evidence to refute remaining evidence in addition to the other reasons described in more detail below.\n\nThe available genetic evidence for the gene-disease relationship between *CACNB4* and epilepsy phenotypes includes 7 probands across 4 publications (PMIDs:10762541, 18755274, 27959697, 32042491). However, all genetic evidence has been discarded. In three cases (PMID:10762541), confirmation selective gel electrophoresis (CSGE) was used to identify variants in *CACNB4*. CSGE is a screening method used to detect variation in only the gene of interest; therefore, there is no way to confirm that the probands did not have another genetic cause to explain their phenotype. In two cases (PMIDs:18755274, 27959697), another variant was identified in a known disease-causing gene. And in two cases (PMID:32042491), there is greater than one individual present in gnomAD (v2.1.1). \n\nExperimental evidence is also available in the literature including protein interaction, functional alteration, and a mouse model; however, in the absence of genetic evidence, no experimental evidence will be counted. \n\nIn summary, the evidence supporting the relationship between *CACNB4* and autosomal dominant epilepsy has been updated to refuted following recuration and no valid evidence remains. New evidence would be needed to support this claim. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Epilepsy Gene Curation Expert Panel on July 5, 2022 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/817d86d9-69ac-4657-b000-702204bf11e7","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d2fad131-8e91-4874-9394-8b86d6d62abb","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"NoKnownDiseaseRelationship","changes":[{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},{"id":"cg:newEvidence"},{"id":"cg:sopChange"},{"id":"cg:classificationChange"},{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d2fad131-8e91-4874-9394-8b86d6d62abb_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10005","date":"2022-07-05T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d2fad131-8e91-4874-9394-8b86d6d62abb_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10005","date":"2022-07-15T12:36:00.538Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"After reviewing Heyne et al., 2019 (PMID:31056551), there is no valid evidence that remains to support a role for variants in this gene in human disease.
