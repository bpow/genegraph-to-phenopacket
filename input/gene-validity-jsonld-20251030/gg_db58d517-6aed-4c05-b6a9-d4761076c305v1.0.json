RNASEH2A encodes the ribonuclease H2 subunit A, which comprises 299 amino acids. RNASEH enzymes endolytically cleave ribonucleotides from RNA:DNA duplexes, which occur during DNA replication, transcription and translation. RNASEH2 has been proposed to function in the removal of lagging strand Okazaki fragment RNA primers during DNA replication, as well as in the excision of single ribonucleotides from DNA:DNA duplexes (PMIDs: 21177854, 16845400). \n\nThe described autosomal recessive RNASEH2A phenotype is considered to be a form of type 1 interferonopathy, which is defined as a condition in which increased type 1 interferon signaling leads to autoimmune and neurological disorders (MONDO: 0700259). These disorders are caused by variants in genes involved in nucleic acid metabolism, sensing, and the innate immune response. Individuals with biallelic variants in RNASEH2A can present with a range of symptoms of variable severity and age of onset, within the context of an autoimmune disease.\n\nAt least eight unique variants (missense, splicing, nonsense) have been reported across 10 probands in 4 publications (PMIDs: 29239743, 23592335, 16845400, 24183309) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is thought to be loss of function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence (model system studies, PMID: 26880576). A study by Pokatayev et al., 2016 showed that Rnaseh2aG37S/G37S knock-in mice demonstrate increased expression of IFN-stimulated genes and subsequent immune system activation. \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between RNASEH2A and autosomal recessive RNASEH2A-related type 1 interferonopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic setting, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approached by the ClinGen Leukodystrophy and Leukoencephalopathy GCEP on the meeting date July 10, 2024 (SOP Version 10). \n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/db58d517-6aed-4c05-b6a9-d4761076c305","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/dca1f8e4-e678-4c72-9698-6e56381cfa7b","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/dca1f8e4-e678-4c72-9698-6e56381cfa7b_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10107","date":"2024-08-26T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/dca1f8e4-e678-4c72-9698-6e56381cfa7b_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10107","date":"2024-08-27T00:31:42.349Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/dca1f8e4-e678-4c72-9698-6e56381cfa7b_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/dca1f8e4-e678-4c72-9698-6e56381cfa7b_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6a70813f-237c-4f08-b4ca-7852d93e3dc1","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/94702b5f-992e-4704-86e6-aa5880ddee40","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Model system demonstrates increased expression of IFN-stimulated genes and subsequent immune system activation.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26880576","rdfs:label":"RNASEH2A G37S knock-in mouse model","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/dca1f8e4-e678-4c72-9698-6e56381cfa7b_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f7e1a51c-91cb-4ce4-867d-f8f478e2727d_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/284a328f-23d1-49b0-a63d-8c5e0f831d83","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/284a328f-23d1-49b0-a63d-8c5e0f831d83_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"\"The Tm values were 56°C for WT, 53°C for A-N212I, A-R291H, B-A177T, B-V185G and C-R69W and 50°C for A-G37S.
