(PMID: 2863444). HCII is a serine protease inhibitor in plasma that rapidly inhibits thrombin in the presence of dermatan sulfate or heparin. However, HCII deficiency may represent only a modest risk of thrombosis, becoming clinically manifest only when additional inherited or acquired thrombogenic conditions are present. In 1987, Andersson et al. (PMID: 2443998) established an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance, which affected individuals having half the normal amount of HCF II. These individuals were molecularly characterized by Blinder et al. (PMID: 2647747) in 1989.  At least 8 unique variants (including missense and frameshift variants) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 10 probands in 7 publications (PMIDs: 8902986, 2647747, 15337701, 31064749, 11204559, 8562924, 29296762). Variants in this gene segregated with HCII deficiency in 23 additional family members. This gene-disease relationship is supported by its biochemical function of inhibiting thrombin (PMID: 6895893), the alteration of expression (PMID: 2863444) and function (PMID: 2647747) observed in patients, and multiple mouse models which recapitulate the HCII deficiency and increased susceptibility to induced thrombosis but can be rescued with human HCII (PMID: 17549254, 11805133). In summary, SERPIND1 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant heparin cofactor II deficiency.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fef8c305-d6f1-4279-b37f-698bd45075fe","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0888745c-f1e6-4af7-bdcd-bd229f043f07","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0888745c-f1e6-4af7-bdcd-bd229f043f07_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2020-11-18T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0888745c-f1e6-4af7-bdcd-bd229f043f07_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2020-12-02T15:36:36.287Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0888745c-f1e6-4af7-bdcd-bd229f043f07_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0888745c-f1e6-4af7-bdcd-bd229f043f07_ad_null_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/74e5b3a4-38d4-492e-9d67-56fbed802d8b_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The frameshift variant c.321dup in exon 2 of 5 generates a premature stop codon expected to result in NMD, which is consistent with the little to no circulating HCII observed in the patient sample by Western blot.","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2373e521-d2e7-44ee-968f-dac4d12a1a5a","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8562924","rdfs:label":"Matsuo Patient","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":61,"detectionMethod":"Sequenced all five exons and flanking regions of SERPIND1 gene, amplified by PCR technique. \nTo confirm the mutation site in the genes from the members of the HCII Awaji family, PCR was performed using Tsp5091 mutagenic primer and digested the PCR products by Tsp509I.","firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0000819","obo:HP_0000822","obo:HP_0003124","obo:HP_0001681","obo:HP_0040226","obo:HP_0005145"],"previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","secondTestingMethod":"Restriction digest","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/74e5b3a4-38d4-492e-9d67-56fbed802d8b_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8562924","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/661a0f64-509e-4ae9-bb14-2f0e51f0b42c","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000185.4(SERPIND1):c.321dup (p.Val108fs)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA124491"}}}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNullCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2324c89c-966c-4bf6-ae51-b90f903da464_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The Phe477fs variant occurs in exon 5 of 5 and results in alteration of the remaining 28 amino acids followed by a 4 amino acid extension and a new stop codon.
