Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in molecular mechanism and phenotypic variability. Inheritance patterns show that NPHP14 is caused by biallelic variants while JBTS19 is caused by heterozygous variants in *ZNF423*. Since the significance of the JBTS patients with a single variant is not clear, this data was not scored (PMIDs: 22863007, 31216405). Therefore, the two disease entities have been lumped into one disease entity: ciliopathy (OMIM:614844). At least 11 unique variants (missense) have been reported in 7 individuals in 7 publications (PMIDs: 22863007, 26539891, 28454995, 33531950, 30076350, 31964843, 30868567). The mechanism of pathogenicity is reported to be loss of function. This gene-disease association is also supported by biochemical function, functional alteration, protein interaction studies, and mouse models (PMID: 17151198, 17524391, 22863007, 27727273, 33517396). In summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged. This gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the ClinGen Kidney Cystic and Ciliopathy Disorders GCEP on March 23, 2022. It was re-evaluated on June 26, 2024 as per SOP version 10. As a result of this reevaluation, the classification increased from Limited to Moderate with the addition of a new case-level and experimental evidence (PMIDs: 26539891, 28454995, 27727273, 30868567).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/296f28d7-05ef-40c3-9892-78a8098c3492","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c61623dd-07b1-41c5-b445-3f9f8575cc06","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c61623dd-07b1-41c5-b445-3f9f8575cc06_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10066","date":"2025-10-30T14:21:24.877Z","role":"Publisher"},{"agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10060","role":"SecondaryContributor"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c61623dd-07b1-41c5-b445-3f9f8575cc06_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10066","date":["2024-06-26T16:00:00.000Z","2024-06-26T04:00:00.000Z"],"role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["ErrorClarification"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c61623dd-07b1-41c5-b445-3f9f8575cc06_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c61623dd-07b1-41c5-b445-3f9f8575cc06_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9c34dcf7-49b3-4b49-8caf-5fa26986a412","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/36989dbc-85e8-4960-8357-47d6afb43d1e","type":"Finding","dc:description":" ZNF423 was shown to directly interact with CEP290, localizing to the ciliary transition zone. It was confirmed in a direct yeast two-hybrid assay and by co-immunoprecipitation of CEP290/NPHP6 with ZNF423 expressed in HEK293T cells. \n","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22863007","rdfs:label":"Chaki protein interaction","demonstrates":{"id":"obo:MI_0915"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cc03bdc7-a3dd-4bc9-8b47-08c454d94c80","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f627b0a8-3538-40a6-aab4-fcf9aa6f6acf","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Zfp423 Regulates Sonic Hedgehog Signaling via Primary Cilium Function.

Analysis of serial coronal sections through the cerebellum confirmed the reduction of the hemispheres and the vermis. In the most severely affected mice, the entire cerebellum was absent. OAZ loss-of-function also disrupted cerebellar vermis development.
