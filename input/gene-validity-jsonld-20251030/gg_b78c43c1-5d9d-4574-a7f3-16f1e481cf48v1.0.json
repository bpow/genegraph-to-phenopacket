(PMID: 3978841). It was later associated with SOX9 (PMIDs: 19639023, 27706140, 31358994, 32470376). Evidence supporting this gene disease relationship includes segregation data and expression data. Large duplications at the 17q24.3 locus involving the coding regions of KCNJ2 and KCNJ16 as well as the regulatory region of SOX9 have been reported in patients with Cooks syndrome (PMIDs: 32583964, 32470376, 19639023). The mechanism of disease is thought to be misexpression of Kcnj2 due to a position effect which places the gene under the regulation of a SOX9 enhancer (PMID: 27706140, 32470376).  In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the Skeletal Disorders Gene Curation Expert Panel on 8/3/2020.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b78c43c1-5d9d-4574-a7f3-16f1e481cf48","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a1fdeca1-a725-4ccb-a7f6-e77c2d6158aa","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a1fdeca1-a725-4ccb-a7f6-e77c2d6158aa_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10065","date":"2020-09-18T13:04:51.767Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a1fdeca1-a725-4ccb-a7f6-e77c2d6158aa_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10065","date":"2020-09-16T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a1fdeca1-a725-4ccb-a7f6-e77c2d6158aa_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a1fdeca1-a725-4ccb-a7f6-e77c2d6158aa_seg_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/294f9f15-454d-460f-a989-c501e2a446d9_family_segregation","type":"FamilyCosegregation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19639023","rdfs:label":"Family
