VEZF1 is a transcriptional regulatory protein that is expressed in human heart tissue (PMID: 15882861). Inactivation of Vezf1 results in embryonic lethality in the mouse caused by angiogenic remodeling defects and loss of vascular integrity in homozygous mutant embryos (PMID: 15882861). Knockout of Vezf1 in zebrafish caused increased pericardial cavity size and decreased the number and size of ventricular cardiomyocytes and showed no hemodynamic stress-induced increase in cardiac growth and contractile function (PMID: 31911272). RNA sequencing, qRT-PCR and Western blot analysis showed that VEZF1 knockout significantly lowers β-myosin heavy chain (β-MHC/Myh7) expression and downregulated other key genes in cardiac systolic function (PMID: 31911272). Publications that presented genetic evidence were excluded due to DCM GCEP concerns of suspect data (Shi et al., 2023, PMID: 36657711). No convincing evidence for a causal role for VEZF1 for AD DCM has been reported. Although this gene-disease assertion is supported by expression and protein interaction studies, no reports have directly implicated this gene in humans. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Dilated Cardiomyopathy Working Group on 01/10/2025 (SOP Version 10).
