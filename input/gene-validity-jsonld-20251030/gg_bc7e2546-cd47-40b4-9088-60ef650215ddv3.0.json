Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome 8 is a subtype of HPS, characterized by oculocutaneous albinism, bleeding diathesis and platelet dysfunction. *BLOC1S3* encodes subunit 3 of the Biogenesis of Lysosome-related Organelles Complex 1, BLOC-1, which is required for normal biogenesis of specialized organelles of the endosomal-lysosomal system, such as melanosomes and platelet dense granules (PMID: 15102850). Of the 8 subunits of BLOC-1, mutations in three, including *BLOC1S3*, are reported in association with HPS subtypes in humans (Huizing et al., Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome, GeneReviews). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level and experimental data.\n\nSummary of Case Level Data (5.9 points):\nVariants in this gene have been reported in at least 6 probands in 4 publications (PMID: 16385460, 22709368, 31064749, 32687635). The variant was found to cosegregate with disease in 5 additional individuals in 1 family (PMID: 16385460).    \nThe mechanism for disease is expected to be biallelic loss of function. The BLOC1S3 is a two exon gene with essentially 1 coding exon. Truncated transcripts are not expected to undergo NMD; however, the one published report predicts boundary-independent NMD (PMID: 22709368). \n  \nSummary of Experimental Data (4 points): \nThis gene-disease association is supported by studies of protein interaction with other subunits of BLOC-1(PMID: 15102850), functional alteration of melansome maturation (PMID: 22709368), and by the spontaneously occurring mouse mutation, “reduced pigmentation” or rp that recapitulates the HPS phenotype (PMID: 15265785). \n  \nIn summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. \n\nThis gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the HT GCEP on 09/23/2020. It was reevaluated on 09/28/2022 and 03/24/2025. As a result of these reevaluations no new evidence was identified and the classification remained at Moderate (SOP Version 11).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bc7e2546-cd47-40b4-9088-60ef650215dd","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bdeec503-f903-4507-89e7-33c9255b5ad1","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","changes":[{"id":"cg:sopChange"},{"id":"cg:summaryChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bdeec503-f903-4507-89e7-33c9255b5ad1_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2025-04-07T13:00:03.446Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bdeec503-f903-4507-89e7-33c9255b5ad1_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2025-04-07T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["RecurationTiming"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bdeec503-f903-4507-89e7-33c9255b5ad1_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/39bc818e-4164-41f1-8629-d6a6c86217cb_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/39bc818e-4164-41f1-8629-d6a6c86217cb","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32687635","rdfs:label":"Pennamen_Patient F2.II.1","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":12,"allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c5e0f473-9852-4933-82a5-bb0f72520f2d","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_212550.5(BLOC1S3):c.444_467del (p.Gln150_Ala157del)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/870134"}},"detectionMethod":"Targeted NGS panel including the 19 albinism genes was applied: TYR, OCA2, TYRP1, SLC45A2, SLC24A5, LRMDA, GPR143, SLC38A8, HPS1, AP3B1, HPS3, HPS4, HPS5, HPS6, DTNBP1, BLOC1S3, BLOC1S6, AP3D1, LYST.
