MS4A1 encodes a member of the membrane-spanning 4A gene family, a B-lymphocyte surface molecule, CD20, which plays a role in the development and differentiation of B-cells into plasma cells. Common Variable Immunodeficiency, also referred to as CD20 deficiency, is characterized by persistently low levels of IgG and recurrent respiratory infections (Kuijpers et al; PMID: 20038800). CD20 is expressed on all B cells from the late pre-B cell stage to memory B cells.  It is not expressed on terminally differentiated plasmablasts and plasma cells, except in the context of certain B cell malignancies. CD20 deficiency is exceedingly rare, but based on a single report appears to affect peripheral B cell differentiation. CD20 has been shown to regulate signaling through the B cell receptor (BCR). CD20 is a popular therapeutic target for B cell depletion in malignancies, autoimmunity, and other immune dysregulatory conditions (PMIDs: 32482755, 33563755, 32210425). There may be a hierarchical loss of immunoglobulin isotypes after B cell depletion with anti-CD20 therapeutic antibodies with some isotypes, such as IgM and IgG being more affected than IgA (PMID: 23136242). MS4A1 was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive common variable immunodeficiency 5 in 2010 (Kuijpers et al, PMID: 20038800). Bogaert et al, 2016 (PMID: 27250108) reported that this patient did not completely fulfil diagnostic criteria for CVID. To date, this is the only patient that has been reported with a loss-of-function variant in MS4A1 and a positive disease association. There is limited evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship including case-level data and experimental data. \n   \nSummary of Case Level Data (3 points):\nThere has been 1 patient from 1 publication, till date, reported with a homozygous variant in MS4A1 (PMID: 20038800). The mechanism of disease is expected to be biallelic loss of function. \n\nSummary of experimental data (2 points):\nThis gene-disease relationship is supported by animal model and expression evidence. MS4A1 is specifically expressed on B-lymphocytes and functions as part of the B-cell surface complex involved in transmembrane Ca2+ transport (PMID: 14688067). Knock-out of MS4A1 in two mouse models showed that mice had a defect in B-cell maturation and defective Ca2+ transport (PMID: 23966626, 14688067) and partially recapitulate the human phenotype.  \n  \nIn summary, the level of evidence to support the gene-disease relationship of MS4A1 and autosomal recessive Common Variable Immunodeficiency 5 is limited. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/95480774-8709-4eb4-8f35-1ba1e2b01317","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/eba48c0f-53fa-48c9-8f4e-9892d095b515","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/eba48c0f-53fa-48c9-8f4e-9892d095b515_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10080","date":"2022-03-02T18:57:25.136Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/eba48c0f-53fa-48c9-8f4e-9892d095b515_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10080","date":"2022-03-02T18:57:14.677Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/eba48c0f-53fa-48c9-8f4e-9892d095b515_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/69f91fbf-2555-437e-ad2b-620080c20382_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0ff1adcd-543c-4096-bf65-c57d4011a79b","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The proband was homozygous for a 11-bp insertion and 2-bp deletion in intron 5, near the non-canonical splice donor (GC) - NM_152866.3:c.336+5_336+6insGACATATGGTTdelTA.

WT mice generated higher anti-AAV neutralizing Ab response compared with Cd20-/- mice. In response to sheep red blood cells, IgM (~45%) and secondary IgG (~47%) responses were significantly reduced in Cd20-/- mice. Of note, the patient described with CD20 deficiency in PMID: 20038800 is noted to have reduced-absent IgG but normal IgM. Cd20-/- mice also showed reduced germinal center B cell numbers. Calcium responses were found to be lower in Cd20-/- B cells compared to WT cells. Cross-linking the BCR in memory B cells using F(ab′)2 anti-mouse IgG resulted in lower magnitude of calcium flux in Cd20−/− B cells; however, no difference in the amounts of stored calcium were observed in these cells. B cell activation was also noted to be impaired in Cd20-/- mice. It is worth noting that the original paper (PMID: 20038800) that generated this mouse model did not find any major effect on B cell maturation due to Cd20 disruption. In human CD20 deficiency described in PMID: 20038800, the loss of CD20 did not disturb the differentiation of precursor B cells in the bone marrow.
