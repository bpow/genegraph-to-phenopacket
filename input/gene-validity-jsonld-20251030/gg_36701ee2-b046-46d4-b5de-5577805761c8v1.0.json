While various names have been given to the constellation of features seen in those with *LRPPRC*-related disorders, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the LRPPRC phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework. Of note, LRPPRC was first curated by this Expert Panel for its association with Leigh syndrome spectrum (LSS) on December 9, 2019 (SOP V7), with a final classification of Definitive. This current curation for the association with primary mitochondrial disease includes the cases included in the LSS curation.\n\nEvidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included six variants [two missense variants including NM_133259.4:c.1061C>T (p.Ala354Val) that is a founder variant from the French Canadian population, one in-frame deletion, one intronic variant, and two splice site variants) in 13 probands from five publications (PMIDs: 12529507, 21266382, 26510951, 38046674, 32972427). Clinical features in affected individuals include LSS, severe lactic acidosis, severe developmental delay, acute neurodegeneration, brain malformations, feeding difficulty, dysphagia, hypoglycemia, cardiomyopathy, and dysmorphic features. Complex IV deficiency is seen in muscle and skin fibroblasts. There have been reports of variants in *LRPPRC* being associated with primary ovarian insufficiency, however currently conclusive evidence is lacking to support this association (PMIDs: 32962729, 28284481).\n\nThe mechanism of disease is loss of function This gene-disease association is also supported by its known biochemical function of LRPPRC, functional alteration in patient and non-patient cells, and fruit fly and mouse model systems (PMIDs: 26510951, 25835550, 20677761, 25428350, 28575497, 22045337, 22045337).\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between *LRPPRC* and primary mitochondrial disease. This relationship has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on June 20, 2024 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/36701ee2-b046-46d4-b5de-5577805761c8","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/72f89e4d-6a21-4556-b601-ce87f4ab60d4","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/72f89e4d-6a21-4556-b601-ce87f4ab60d4_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2024-06-20T04:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/72f89e4d-6a21-4556-b601-ce87f4ab60d4_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2025-02-05T19:16:31.026Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/72f89e4d-6a21-4556-b601-ce87f4ab60d4_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cf9c543c-b38e-4259-a8d9-b353d12f917c_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7f96fe23-6691-4975-9008-35c5bbcc102c","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7f96fe23-6691-4975-9008-35c5bbcc102c_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32972427","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4f5928f6-9a30-4f7b-bd10-f4878a337cbf","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_133259.4(LRPPRC):c.2056A>G (p.Ile686Val)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA1638616"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":0.1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1c012b0c-94e6-4a40-b687-e37c3eca8f8f","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1c012b0c-94e6-4a40-b687-e37c3eca8f8f_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32972427","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9d3471fa-ef5e-4177-aa40-4bcc82b086d4","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_133259.4(LRPPRC):c.1921-7A>G","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA1638664"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cf9c543c-b38e-4259-a8d9-b353d12f917c","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32972427","rdfs:label":"Piro - Case","allele":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9d3471fa-ef5e-4177-aa40-4bcc82b086d4"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4f5928f6-9a30-4f7b-bd10-f4878a337cbf"}],"phenotypeFreeText":"This Italian boy was born preterm (28+6/7 weeks) and had severe global neurodevelopmental impairment, generalized hypotonia, dystonia, dysphagia, exophoria, visual and hearing impairment (unspecified), FTT, swallow dysfunction, and brain MRI abnormalities (cortical atrophy, hypoplasia of corpus callosum, cerebellar vermis hypoplasia, left lateral ventricular dilatation, unfolded hippocampi), dysmorphic features (prominent forehead, hypertelorism, broad nasal bridge, anteverted nares, flattened philtrum, thin upper lip, high arched palate).
