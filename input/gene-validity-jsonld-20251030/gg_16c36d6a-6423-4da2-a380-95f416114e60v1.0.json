Of these conditions, Schindler disease, type I, has been reported as the most severe. This disorder was first described in two German brothers with infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy, with rapid and severe progression (Schindler et al, 1989, PubMed: 2733734). Schindler disease, type III, is less severe and can present with developmental, neurologic, and psychiatric manifestations in childhood. A different clinical presentation of NAGA deficiency, Kanzaki disease, was first reported in a Japanese patient and is characterized by angiokeratoma corporis diffusum and mild sensory neuropathy (Kanzaki et al, 1991, PubMed: 1907616). Of note, several sibling pairs have been reported with low NAGA activity, abnormal urine glycoproteins, and biallelic variants in NAGA, with one sibling presenting with severe clinical symptoms and an older sibling reported to asymptomatic, or having only mild symptoms. Furthermore, the severity of symptoms does not appear to correlate with the residual enzyme activity. Therefore, the clinical symptoms associated with NAGA deficiency are unclear and, presumably, additional factors have a role in the phenotypes reported in these patients (Keulemans et al, 1996, PMID: 8782044). For the purposes of this curation, reported cases have been lumped under the umbrella term, alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase deficiency (NAGA deficiency) (MONDO:0017779 ). Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in molecular mechanism or inheritance pattern in patients with NAGA deficiency. The biochemical phenotype (low NAGA activity and abnormal urine glycoproteins) appears to be consistent between patients even though the clinical symptoms in these patients is variable.\nNAGA deficiency is a rare condition. In this curation, data from 9 probands with 8 unique variants (7 missense, 1 nonsense) from 7 publications were collected (Wang et al, 1990, PMID: 2243144; Keulemans et al, 1996, PMID: 8782044; Wang et al, 1996, PMID: 8040340; Bakker et al, 2001, PMID: 11313741; Kodama et al, 2001, PMID: 11251574; Chabás et al, 2007, PMID: 17171432; Mohamed et al, 2020, PMID: 31468281) (Total 8.85 points for genetic evidence). The mechanism of pathogenicity is loss of function. \nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence. This includes the biochemical function of NAGA, which is consistent with the biochemical findings in patients (Hermann et al, 1998, PMID: 9602128; Mohamed et al, 2020, PMID: 31468281), and a knock out mouse model with no evidence of neurological issues but widespread lysosomal storage of abnormal material in the nervous system and other organs, and focal axonal swellings or spheroids in the central nervous system (in “Schindler disease: deficient α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase activity\", in Rosenberg's Molecular and Genetic Basis of Neurological and Psychiatric Disease (Sixth Edition) Volume 1: 2020, Pages 589-598).\nIn summary, NAGA is definitively associated with autosomal recessive NAGA deficiency. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Lysosomal Disorders Gene Curation Expert Panel on September 29, 2022 (SOP v9).\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/16c36d6a-6423-4da2-a380-95f416114e60","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/94962878-05e3-4cc0-a6d7-e9cd86f49b1d","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/94962878-05e3-4cc0-a6d7-e9cd86f49b1d_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10110","date":"2022-09-29T14:39:13.066Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/94962878-05e3-4cc0-a6d7-e9cd86f49b1d_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10110","date":"2022-09-29T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/94962878-05e3-4cc0-a6d7-e9cd86f49b1d_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/437a4d13-e0c2-4551-a395-efeb31a24af9_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9e354d65-93b0-47b5-980a-5e87987b17e2","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1.0,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9e354d65-93b0-47b5-980a-5e87987b17e2_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"When expressed in COS-1 cells, the variant did not increase alpha-NAGA activity above endogenous values, compared to wild type which increased endogenous activity by 30 fold.","functionalDataSupport":"Yes"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9e354d65-93b0-47b5-980a-5e87987b17e2_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8040340","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3b4e2906-c9bb-495a-83a2-963df84838a1","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000262.3(NAGA):c.985C>T (p.Arg329Trp)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA127849"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:AlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":1.0},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/437a4d13-e0c2-4551-a395-efeb31a24af9","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8040340","rdfs:label":"First Kanzaki syndrome patient","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":59,"allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3b4e2906-c9bb-495a-83a2-963df84838a1"},"detectionMethod":"RT-PCR followed by sequencing of the coding region of NAGA.","firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypeFreeText":"\"diffuse angiokeratoma\" appearing at around age 28 years on lower torso and then spreading; peripheral neuroaxonal degeneration; dilated, tortuous vessels in ocular conjunctiva and fundi; sensory nerve conduction studies showed a marked decrease in amplitude with normal velocity.\nAt 59 years (PMID 15136691), worsening numbness and muscle weakness in the extremities, since age 40 years.
