SRPS is characterized by a constricted thoracic cage, short ribs, shortened tubular bones, and a 'trident' appearance of the acetabular roof. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in molecular mechanisms or inheritance pattern, with lethality dependent on the size of the thoracic cage being the primary difference in phenotypic variability. Therefore, the following disease entities have been lumped into one disease entity, short-rib thoracic dysplasia 2 with or without polydactyly (OMIM:611263), short-rib thoracic dysplasia (SRTD), asphyxiating throracid dystrophy (ATD), and Jeune syndrome. 16 variants (missense, in-frame indel, nonsense, frameshift, canonical splice site) that have been reported in 12 probands in 6 publications (PMIDs: 17468754, 19648123, 23339108, 29068549, 30767363, 33452237) are included in this curation. The mechanism of pathogenicity is known to be loss of function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by models replicating human phenotypes and ciliary alterations in Tetrahymena thermophila, zebrafish, and mice (PMIDs: 17468754, 17468754, 21227999). In summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *IFT80* and autosomal recessive *IFT80*-related short-rib thoracic dysplasia. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Skeletal Disorders GCEP on the meeting date August 5, 2024 (SOP Version 10).\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/09d6159c-b2d2-41bd-a444-a81f16a36597","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/19aad708-aeaf-4601-976b-6bc2809e583e","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/19aad708-aeaf-4601-976b-6bc2809e583e_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10065","date":"2024-08-05T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/19aad708-aeaf-4601-976b-6bc2809e583e_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10065","date":"2025-01-07T16:43:41.537Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/19aad708-aeaf-4601-976b-6bc2809e583e_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/19aad708-aeaf-4601-976b-6bc2809e583e_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c852b1a9-268a-4064-a9f0-9f9535c1a9d5","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Downgraded due to another model as part of the same study.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/99a10b7e-1f92-4b93-b764-1ecc488a31cd","type":"Finding","dc:description":"This ciliate is decorated with around 750 basal bodies and cilia and is amenable to gene engineering.

Mutations in genes encoding other complex B IFT proteins have been shown to result in spinal cord patterning abnormalities secondary to defective Smo and Gli3 function affecting hedgehog signaling10,11,12. We therefore examined ptc1 gene expression as a measure of altered hedgehog signaling in the morphant fish (ptc1 expression is activated by hedgehog signaling). ptc1 was downregulated in ift80 morphants, with real-time quantitative PCR indicating 43% of control expression. Moreover, the upregulation of ptc1 seen when the Sonic hedgehog (Shh) pathway was activated by ptc1 morpholino injection was abrogated by coinjection of ift80 morpholino, suggesting that ift80 acts downstream of ptc1.
