Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working group, while the molecular mechanism is not yet fully understood, individual variants appear to segregate with specific phenotypes and we have therefore split curations for the disease entities BWS and ADNSHL. ACTG1 was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant nonsyndromic hearing loss in 2003 (Zhu et al., PMID: 13680526). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data and experimental evidence. MIssense variants in this gene have been reported in at least 24 probands with ADNSHL in 15 publications (Zhu et al., 2003 PMID: 13680526; van Wijk et al., 2003 PMID: 14684684; Rendtorff et al., 2006 PMID: 16773128; Morin et al., 2009 PMID: 19477959; de Heer et al., 2009 PMID: 19548389; Liu et al., 2008 PMID: 18804074; Miyagawa et al., 2013 PMID: 24130743; Miyagawa et al., 2015 PMID: 25792668; Baek et all., 2013 PMID: 22938506; Park et al., 2013 PMID: 23506231; Vona et al., 2014 PMID: 24875298; Wei et al., 2014 PMID: 25388789; Cabanillas et al., 2018 PMID: 29986705; Lee et al., 2018 PMID: 29620237; Wang et al. 2018 PMID: 30599039). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in >100 additional family members. Although most de novo variants are seen in cases of BWS due to reduced reproductive fitness, de novo variants have been observed in individuals with ADNSHL (LMM unpublished data; Cabanillas et al. 2018 PMID: 29986705; Wang et al. 2018 PMID: 29357087). No loss-of-function variants have been reported in affected individuals, and one individual with a large deletion on chromosome 17 encompassing the ACTG1 gene did not have any of the major features of BWS including hearing loss (Riviere et al. 2012 PMID: 22366783). Additionally, no changes in protein levels of ACTG1 in patient cell lines containing pathogenic variants in ACTG1 were observed (Riviere et al. 2012 PMID: 22366783). These data suggest haploinsufficiency is not a mechanism of either ADNSHL or BWS and suggest both disorders may be due to gain-of-function through two distinct effects. Yeast models support functional effects of some of the reported hearing loss-causing variants (Bryan et al. 2006 PMID: 16690605, Bryan et al. 2009 PMID: 19419963; Morin et al., 2009 PMID: 19477959), and there is evidence that the amino acid position 118 is a mutational hot spot (Wang et al. 2018, PMID: 30599039). A homozygous ACTG1-null mouse model demonstrates progressive hearing loss which supports a role of the ACTG1 gene in hearing (Belyantseva et al. 2009, PMID: 19497859); however, this model constributed only limited experimental support given the mismatch in mutational mechanism to the human cases. Perrin et al., 2010 (PMID: 20976199) studied an ACTG1 conditional mouse model, however this model did not contribute additional data beyond the first mouse model given that the gene was knocked out as well. In summary, ACTG1 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant nonsyndromic hearing loss, based primarily on many human case observations with extensive segregation. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hearing Loss Working Group on 01/07/19.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/53f6bfa8-e315-45df-a5cd-c1b2c056564a","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/db9f5d19-5ebc-4a1a-a4c3-79ff27f69a0e","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/db9f5d19-5ebc-4a1a-a4c3-79ff27f69a0e_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2019-01-07T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/db9f5d19-5ebc-4a1a-a4c3-79ff27f69a0e_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/db9f5d19-5ebc-4a1a-a4c3-79ff27f69a0e_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/db9f5d19-5ebc-4a1a-a4c3-79ff27f69a0e_ad_dn_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6c5b5880-5e6c-42b7-830e-126e2c35ca23_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Variant is de novo.

At time of publication, connection to BWS had not been discovered so other phenotypes beyond hearing were not investigated. Null mice exhibited progressive hearing loss that began after 6 weeks of age. By 24 weeks they were profoundly deaf. Heterozygotes had normal hearing at 24 weeks. Implicates ACTG1 in hearing but mechanism (LOF) is inconsistent. (Riviere 2012 showed BWS patient cells had no decrease in ACTG1 protein levels). While mice were viable, they were born at one-third expected mendelian ratio suggesting some degree of embryonic lethality. Overall development of null mice appeared normal but were ~20% smaller than WT and hets. Other types of actin were upregulated in null mouse tissues.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19497859","rdfs:label":"Belyantseva Animal Model","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":399,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria6","strengthScore":13,"subject":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/V8o50bwG1eY","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0019497","gene":"hgnc:144","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"1.0","websiteLegacyID":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/assertion_db9f5d19-5ebc-4a1a-a4c3-79ff27f69a0e-","@context":{"@vocab":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"},"curationReasons":{"@type":"@vocab","@container":"@set"},"GCISnapshot":{"@type":"@id"},"dc:isVersionOf":{"@type":"@id"},"websiteLegacyID":{"@type":"@id"}}}
