At least 13 unique missense variants affecting exon 344 of the titin A band have been reported in over 50 affected individuals. \n\nPer criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we determined the unique genetic basis (missense variants in exon 344 of the titin A band) and clinical presentation of autosomal dominant hereditary proximal myopathy with prominent respiratory failure warranted a split curation from autosomal recessive titinopathies and from autosomal dominant tibial muscular dystrophy.\n\nEvidence ​supporting this gene-disease relationship includes ​case-level data from 17 probands in 6 publications (PMID: 22577215, PMID: 23446887, PMID: 23514108, PMID: 23606733, PMID: 25253871, PMID: 30666435) as well as familial segregation data (6.6 points). \n\nThis gene-disease association is also supported by biochemical and expression evidence supporting the role of *TTN* in affected tissues (PMID: 20551232, PMID: 16949617, 1 point). \n\nIn summary, there is moderate evidence to support the relationship between *TTN* and ​autosomal dominant hereditary proximal myopathy with prominent respiratory failure. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Congenital Myopathies Gene Curation Expert Panel on 8/23/2021 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/41fd528d-b50e-4d94-b8a2-67a45b95fa11","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bade9ef3-17fa-42ee-a2d7-9c9b985b1503","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bade9ef3-17fa-42ee-a2d7-9c9b985b1503_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10031","date":"2022-03-14T20:51:28.874Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bade9ef3-17fa-42ee-a2d7-9c9b985b1503_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10031","date":"2022-03-14T20:51:17.630Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bade9ef3-17fa-42ee-a2d7-9c9b985b1503_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bade9ef3-17fa-42ee-a2d7-9c9b985b1503_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b3fdadc3-d0c2-46b4-b434-eb947cc3a10b","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b74fd214-febf-422e-b566-db39e18101be","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Defects in striated muscle leading to muscle weakness are consistent with the well-described role of titin in the assembly and function of the sarcomere.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20551232","rdfs:label":"Titin in sarcomere assembly and function","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0306509f-44ce-4415-b698-7c6cb56b0bee","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Both Human Protein Atlas and GTEx report enhanced TTN expression in human skeletal and heart muscle.","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d1be8cfc-1c24-43e9-8b8c-328d2f40a5c2","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Microarray and RT-qPCR experiments demonstrate the enhanced expression of TTN in adult skeletal muscle, adult heart, and fetal skeletal muscle, with 313 of the 363 TTN exons expressed to some degree in adult skeletal muscle.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16949617","rdfs:label":"TTN expression in striated muscle","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bade9ef3-17fa-42ee-a2d7-9c9b985b1503_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/68d9a37c-f922-4961-8310-2fdb6ce500f8","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The TTN NM_001267550.2:c.95372G>A variant observed in heterozygosity in this proband results in a missense change  (p.Gly31791Asp) and is not reported in gnomAD v2.1.1.
