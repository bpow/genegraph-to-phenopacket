At least two unique variants (1 missense, 1 nonsense) that were reported in two individuals with CHD (PMID: 35422912, 37406974) were included in this curation. There are other individuals reported with variants in *SOX7* in the literature, however they were not included due to inconsistent mechanism of pathogenicity or high frequencies in gnomAD v4 (PMIDs: 24009689, 35260939). Of note, several individuals with CHD were also identified with CNVs that included *SOX7* and other genes including *GATA4* (PMID: 22318994, 33846290, 36816019). This gene-disease relationship is also supported by evidence of biochemical function studies, expression in embryonic human and mouse heart, protein interaction with *GATA4*, and a knockout mouse model replicating the disease phenotype (PMIDs: 35260939, 33846290, 37000005). In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Congenital Heart Disease GCEP on the meeting date October 1st, 2024 (SOP Version 11).\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3041933a-b31c-439a-828e-40bc0ed63af6","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a18a4aac-acfb-4059-949c-75c1cf9fac4f","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a18a4aac-acfb-4059-949c-75c1cf9fac4f_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10130","date":"2024-10-01T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a18a4aac-acfb-4059-949c-75c1cf9fac4f_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10130","date":"2024-11-15T19:31:42.418Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a18a4aac-acfb-4059-949c-75c1cf9fac4f_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d40dab21-713e-4aea-8573-315b58258fb7","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d40dab21-713e-4aea-8573-315b58258fb7_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"Dual-luciferase reporter analysis revealed that Gln104* mutant SOX7 failed to transactivate its two important target genes, GATA4 and BMP2, and invalidated the cooperative transactivation between SOX7 and NKX2.5","functionalDataSupport":"Yes"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d40dab21-713e-4aea-8573-315b58258fb7_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35422912","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/db36ba3f-bbda-4413-9ecd-c6837188cb7b","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_031439.4(SOX7):c.310C>T (p.Gln104Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA370286171"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Heterozygous"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b5242f3e-1e0f-4fe8-8e07-5b76adb50987","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b5242f3e-1e0f-4fe8-8e07-5b76adb50987_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37406974","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/06c425f2-0482-4179-827f-8584993381ba","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_031439.4(SOX7):c.515C>G (p.Pro172Arg)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA370285456"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Heterozygous"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":0.1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a18a4aac-acfb-4059-949c-75c1cf9fac4f_seg_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0ea3cda6-2e43-42c7-b159-e406bb5b4a4d_proband_segregation","type":"FamilyCosegregation","dc:description":"There are only 3 segregations with CHD and the SOX7 variant.
