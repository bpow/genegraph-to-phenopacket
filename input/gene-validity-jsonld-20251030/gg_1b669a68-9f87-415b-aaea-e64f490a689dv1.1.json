Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, there was evidence of differences in their inheritance pattern. Therefore, the following disease entities have been split into multiple disease entities: autosomal dominant focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (OMIM: 607832) and autosomal recessive focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (OMIM: 607832).\n\nThe preferred disease name suggested for this grouping of disorders is focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS).\n\n*CD2AP* was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant focal segmental glomerulosclerosis in 2003 (Kim et al., PMID: 12764198). Clinical manifestation involves proteinuria, nephrotic syndrome (NPHS), and progressive loss of renal function. It is a common cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) (Meyrier, 2005). The mechanism of pathogenicity is known to be loss of function.\n\nTwo variants (frameshift and a large intronic deletion involving a canonical splice site) have been reported in 2/2 probands 2/2 publications (PMIDs: 12764198, 34408996 included in this curation). A total of 3/12 pts. for genetic evidence was reached.\n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by expression studies, animal models, and rescue assays. *CD2AP* is expressed in developing podocytes and the glomerular basement membrane (PMID: 10997929). Additionally, variation in *CD2AP* has been shown to result in the improper formation of the slit diaphragm and the protein filtration barrier of the kidney (PMIDs: 10514378, 16889564). One mouse model demonstrated that mice heterozygous for altered *CD2AP* presented glomerular lesions similar to FSGS in humans (PMID: 12764198). The homozygous mice died of proteinuria. A second study of the same mouse model demonstrated that podocyte-specific expression of *CD2AP* rescued the renal defects of the *CD2AP*-deficient mice (PMID: 15951437). A total of 5/6 pts. for experimental evidence was reached.\n\n\nIn summary, there is moderate evidence supporting the relationship between *CD2AP* and autosomal dominant FSGS. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1b669a68-9f87-415b-aaea-e64f490a689d","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2cae2640-258f-4ba1-8510-2b4db97cf36c","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","changes":[{"id":"cg:sopChange"},{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"},{"id":"cg:moiChange"},{"id":"cg:classificationChange"},{"id":"cg:summaryChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2cae2640-258f-4ba1-8510-2b4db97cf36c_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10068","date":"2024-06-28T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2cae2640-258f-4ba1-8510-2b4db97cf36c_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10068","date":"2024-06-28T20:45:55.659Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2cae2640-258f-4ba1-8510-2b4db97cf36c_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4019e1f7-f355-4ed4-a7c1-1d164da32259","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4019e1f7-f355-4ed4-a7c1-1d164da32259_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12764198","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b7c38ea5-9c11-4403-ba24-06c6b3e91dc5","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_012120.3(CD2AP):c.730-1_730delinsCT","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA117700"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:AlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Heterozygous"}},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4019e1f7-f355-4ed4-a7c1-1d164da32259_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"To confirm that splicing does not occur at this site, we used reverse transcription (RT)-PCR to amplify mRNA that encoded exons 6 to 8 from immortalized B cells generated from these two patients. All sequenced products contained only the wild-type cytosine, with no evidence of thymidine at the sequence that corresponds to the beginning of exon 7, confirming that splicing to exon 7 did not occur on the polymorphic allele. RT-PCR amplification of a larger segment of the CD2AP mRNA demonstrated a truncated message that corresponds to splicing between exons 4 and 18. Because exon 18 codes for part of the 3' untranslated region, the predicted protein product of this variant message would lack more than 80% of the CD2AP protein (Fig. 4C).\n\nImmunoblot analysis of CD2AP expression from lysates of immortalized B lymphocytes confirmed that CD2AP expression was indeed lower in these two patients, compared to a control sample with no detectable CD2AP mutations (Fig. 4D).
