Four variants (missense, frameshift) that have been reported in 4 probands in 3 publications (PMID: 18830233, 30293987, 31570783) are included in this curation. There are more variants reported in individuals with CHD in 6 publications, all of which were not scored due to a high minor allele frequency (>0.00001) in gnomAD v.4, being located in the 5’ untranslated region of the gene, the proband having a syndromic phenotype, and/or the proband having an unclear phenotype (PMID: 18830233, 27418595, 28358424, 30293987, 32552793, 34328347). The mechanism of pathogenicity is reported to be loss-of-function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by expression data in mouse embryos (PMID: 10331975), protein interaction data (PMID: 19366374, 26744331), and a mouse model showing heart defects (PMID: 10331975). In summary, there is limited evidence supporting the relationship between *TLL1* and autosomal dominant congenital heart disease. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Congenital Heart Disease GCEP on the meeting date May 13th, 2024 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7d5bc0a0-5cb3-4106-9f85-73a0e049057f","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/37ed8aea-d2e0-4bab-9e21-4f5ac823ce99","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/37ed8aea-d2e0-4bab-9e21-4f5ac823ce99_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10130","date":"2024-06-27T16:03:43.962Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/37ed8aea-d2e0-4bab-9e21-4f5ac823ce99_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10130","date":"2024-05-13T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/37ed8aea-d2e0-4bab-9e21-4f5ac823ce99_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cffd741a-0741-41aa-ad2b-af6db164aa34","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cffd741a-0741-41aa-ad2b-af6db164aa34_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31570783","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b1c73e28-70a9-48c4-8040-5acffce9def0","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_012464.5(TLL1):c.1379-2A>G","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA358684644"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:DeNovoAlleleOrigin"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:Heterozygous"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8e386433-3c13-423c-8f1e-f952b0325835","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8e386433-3c13-423c-8f1e-f952b0325835_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"Functional
