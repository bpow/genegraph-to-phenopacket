{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7a25fbbf-ae2f-4453-84a7-bed4fcd2e1c2v1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"*NEK1* was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) type 24 in 2015 (Cirulli et al., PMID: 25700176). *NEK1* encodes never in mitosis gene a-related kinase 1 (Nek1) and has a role in cell cycle control and cilia regulation. *NEK1* has also been associated with autosomal recessive short-rib thoracic dysplasia 6 with or without polydactyly. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found a difference in molecular mechanism, inheritance pattern, and phenotypic variability between this disease and ALS type 24. Therefore, the following disease entities have been split into two disease entities: ALS type 24 (OMIM: 617892) and short-rib thoracic dysplasia 6 with or without polydactyly (OMIM:263520). The association between *NEK1* and ALS was first established in an exome-wide gene burden analysis that identified an association between loss of function rare variants in the gene and the phenotype based on the exome sequencing of 2874 ALS cases and 6405 controls (Cirulli et al., PMID: 25700176). This curation also includes an additional 13 case-control analyses from 11 publications (PMIDs: 25700176, 26945885, 27455347, 28935222, 29149916, 30940688, 30976013, 31768050, 32920598, 34544842, 31475037). Additionally, 40 variants, including missense, nonsense, frameshift, and splicing variants, reported in 40 probands in 10 publications (PMIDs: 26945885, 28935222, 30093141, 31108397, 31475037, 32462798, 32772750, 32920598, 33445179, 34564799) are included in this curation. Based on this curation, the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss of function, although missense variants have also been reported in ALS probands. This gene-disease association is also supported by experimental evidence describing physical interaction with other known ALS associated genes and functional alterations in mutated patient cells (PMIDs: 30992335, 29929116, 25700176), although experimental evidence remains marginal overall. In summary, *NEK1* is definitively associated with autosomal dominant ALS type 24. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings as shown by the genetic evidence and has been upheld over time. Although, we believe that more experimental evidence is needed to gain a greater understanding of the involvement of *NEK1* in ALS pathophysiology. It is important to understand that in the clinical diagnostic setting the identification of missense variants of uncertain significance may be common and variant interpretation must be completed with caution. This classification was approved by the ClinGen ALS GCEP on 02/24/2021 (SOPv8).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7a25fbbf-ae2f-4453-84a7-bed4fcd2e1c2","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bb4f311c-df33-4d9e-8ac6-731b43b93615","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bb4f311c-df33-4d9e-8ac6-731b43b93615_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10096","date":"2022-04-29T19:25:26.542Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bb4f311c-df33-4d9e-8ac6-731b43b93615_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10096","date":"2022-04-29T20:48:49.809Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bb4f311c-df33-4d9e-8ac6-731b43b93615_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bb4f311c-df33-4d9e-8ac6-731b43b93615_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/68785106-6155-4add-8e1d-b036b7d4a52b","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4105d5b7-b4a9-4829-91cb-8ea41d43e830","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Motoneurons derived from ALS-patients show signs of increased DNA damage and impaired DNA damage repair after irradiation and during aging.\nFollowing irradiation, ALS patient-derived C9orf72 and NEK1 c.2434A>T motor neurons displayed elevated numbers of γH2A.X+ foci compared to controls at early development, and differences were even greater at later stages of development.

After 24 hours patient-derived cell lines C9orf72 and NEK1c.2434A>T showed less efficient DDR machinery, as the number of cells displaying γH2A.X+ foci were still increased compared to CNTL cells, with the mutant NEK1 cells showing again the strongest pathological phenotype. In 42 days old MNs, both patient-derived cells showed high level of DNA damage (Category III) with significant differences to both controls for line NEK1c.2434A>T.
