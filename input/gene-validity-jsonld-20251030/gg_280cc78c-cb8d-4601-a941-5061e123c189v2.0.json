(PMID:15015131). At least 14 unique variants (missense, nonsense) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level, segregation, and experimental data. MYH14 is thought to play a beneficial role in the protection of the cochlea after acoustic over-stimulation and that loss of function leads to progressive hearing loss (PMID: 28101381). In summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hearing Loss Working Group on 8/31/2020. Of note, MYH14 has also been associated with a neuropathy phenotype that includes hearing loss, but that evidence was not included in this curation.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/280cc78c-cb8d-4601-a941-5061e123c189","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/007697a5-2f83-40d0-b2ea-914e458a1452","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","changes":[{"id":"cg:classificationChange"},{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"},{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},{"id":"cg:sopChange"},{"id":"cg:newEvidence"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/007697a5-2f83-40d0-b2ea-914e458a1452_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2020-09-16T19:23:38.503Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/007697a5-2f83-40d0-b2ea-914e458a1452_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2020-08-31T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/007697a5-2f83-40d0-b2ea-914e458a1452_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/007697a5-2f83-40d0-b2ea-914e458a1452_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/69c0e92f-5c72-4609-9619-7f26e8bc0ca7","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d8e86cc9-ee20-44c8-9d1b-bcab1ef5e2ab","type":"Finding","dc:description":"RT-PCR of the Myh14 gene in mouse cochlea revealed high levels of expression.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15015131","rdfs:label":"RT-PCR of MYH14 in Mouse Cochlea","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b6029ed1-5ecb-48bf-8c7c-5341097087e4","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/94fff316-95c1-4aaf-87a3-4e66b2ecbf17","type":"Finding","dc:description":"RT-PCR and western blot analysis confirmed cochlear expression of MYH14, but they also found that the expression levels of MYH14 were dependent on noise exposure.
