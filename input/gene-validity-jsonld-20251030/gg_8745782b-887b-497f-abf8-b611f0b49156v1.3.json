Cohen-Gibson syndrome is an overgrowth disorder characterized by increased somatic growth parameters with neonatal onset and variable intellectual disability. Affected individuals have dysmorphic facial features, advanced bone age, and skeletal abnormalities, including flaring of the metaphyses of the long bones, large hands with long fingers and camptodactyly, and often scoliosis or cervical spine anomalies. Other features may include hypotonia, difficulty walking due to skeletal anomalies, and umbilical hernia (PMID: 27868325). \n\nNine variants (8 missense and one insertion-deletion) that primarily arise *de novo* or are assumed *de novo* have been reported in 11 probands in 8 publications (PMIDs: 25787343, 27193220, 27868325, 28229514, 28475857, 29410511, 30793471, 30858506) and are included in this curation. Though all variants reported to date have been missense, loss of function has been postulated as the mechanism of disease as a functional copy of *EED* is essential for proper EZH2-mediated methyltransferase activity at H3K27 via the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2). This was supported by western blotting of H3K27me3 as a marker of PRC2 methyltransferase activity; wild-type *EED* rescued normal levels of H3K27me3 whereas at least two reported missense variants failed to do so (PMID: 28229514). This gene-disease relationship is also supported by biochemical function in the PRC2 which maintains gene silencing to play a role in neurogenesis and embryogenesis, and protein interaction with EZH2 to support methyltransferase activity (PMIDs: 9584199, 15225548,  27578866).\n\nIn summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship.

","EED was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant Cohen-Gibson syndrome in 2015 (Cohen et al., PMID: 25787343). Cohen-Gibson syndrome (COGIS) is an overgrowth disorder characterized by increased somatic growth parameters with neonatal onset and variable intellectual disability. Affected individuals have dysmorphic facial features, advanced bone age, and skeletal abnormalities, including flaring of the metaphyses of the long bones, large hands with long fingers and camptodactyly, and often scoliosis or cervical spine anomalies. Other features may include hypotonia, difficulty walking due to skeletal anomalies, and umbilical hernia (Cooney et al., 2017). Nine variants (missense and one insertion-deletion) that primarily arise de novo or assumed de novo have been reported in 11 probands in 8 publications (PMIDs: 25787343, 27193220, 27868325, 28229514, 30793471, 29410511, 30793471, 30858506) and are included in this curation.
