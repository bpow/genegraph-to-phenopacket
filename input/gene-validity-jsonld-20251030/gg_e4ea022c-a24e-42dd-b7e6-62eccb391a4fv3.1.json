At least 4 unique missense variants have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Four variants in this gene have been reported in at least 6 probands in 4 publications (PMIDs: 28289718, 31173466, 31108500, 34080768). This gene-disease association is supported by the interaction of MRAS with the Ras/MAPK pathway, which is associated with the Noonan Syndrome phenotype (PMID: 23875798), as well as interaction with SHOC2 and PPP1CB in the SHOC2-MRAS-PP1C holophosphatase complex (PMID: 35831509). The ClinGen RASopathy Expert Panel has assessed MRAS for associations with Noonan syndrome-like disorder with loose anagen hair, Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines, Costello syndrome, and cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome, however no evidence was reported. In summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged. This curation was approved by the ClinGen RASopathy Expert Panel on 8/27/20. This gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the ClinGen RASopathy Expert Panel on 8/27/20. It was reevaluated on 12/14/22. As a result of this reevaluation, the classification did not change (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e4ea022c-a24e-42dd-b7e6-62eccb391a4f","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/04ca29c1-6b44-474c-b54b-1c8be52de172","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","changes":[{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/04ca29c1-6b44-474c-b54b-1c8be52de172_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10021","date":"2022-12-14T18:49:01.082Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/04ca29c1-6b44-474c-b54b-1c8be52de172_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10021","date":"2022-12-14T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/04ca29c1-6b44-474c-b54b-1c8be52de172_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/04ca29c1-6b44-474c-b54b-1c8be52de172_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/53374b8d-ddac-4fee-ab23-97d8e6aa80ea","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/661254ce-f3fe-4f78-b63c-225c4d94cd31","type":"Finding","dc:description":"The MRAS gene is located in the RAS/MAPK pathway which is associated with Noonan syndrome","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23875798","rdfs:label":"MRAS is in RAS/MAPK pathway","demonstrates":{"id":"obo:MI_0915"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1220b2bd-97c0-444c-a644-22223cbfb01d","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4efaa3f3-6c03-481b-a9b8-8f210c797f69","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Activation of MRAS leads to membrane localization of the SHOC2–MRAS–PP1C (SMP) complex and to the dephosphorylation of proteins of the RAF family at a key inhibitory phosphorylation site, resulting in the release of autoinhibition and the potentiation of RAF activation.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35831509","rdfs:label":"Structure-function analysis of the SHOC2-MRAS-PP1C complex","demonstrates":{"id":"obo:MI_0915"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4aa86719-d48c-4c67-81de-3f7293d005ef","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/387dd105-ceb4-41f9-a000-490e0e9397d3","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Activation of MRAS leads to membrane localization of the SHOC2–MRAS–PP1C (SMP) complex and to the dephosphorylation of proteins of the RAF family at a key inhibitory phosphorylation site resulting in the release of autoinhibition and the potentiation of RAF activation.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35831509","rdfs:label":"Structure–function analysis of the SHOC2–MRAS–PP1C complex","demonstrates":{"id":"obo:MI_0915"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/04ca29c1-6b44-474c-b54b-1c8be52de172_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f27eb5ee-9988-46dc-8f53-5fdeefd8b26b","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Functional evidence was upgraded due to its support of a GOF disease mechanism.","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f27eb5ee-9988-46dc-8f53-5fdeefd8b26b_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34080768","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/875dbf39-85d5-4b6a-8505-2eedfe391f74","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001085049.3(MRAS):c.203C>T (p.Thr68Ile)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/635782"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:AlleleOrigin"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"No","zygosity":{"id":"cg:Heterozygous"}},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f27eb5ee-9988-46dc-8f53-5fdeefd8b26b_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"Raf-RBD pulldown followed by Western blotting in transfected HEK293T/17 cells demonstrated a 4.2-fold increase in GTP loading compared with WT.
