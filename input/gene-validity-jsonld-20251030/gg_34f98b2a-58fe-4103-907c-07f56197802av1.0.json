One missense mutation in ID2 was reported in a human causing developmental and epileptic encephalopathy, however the congenital heart phenotype was not mentioned (PMID: 31175295). The mechanism of disease is unknown. This gene-disease relationship is supported by two expression studies in the heart (PMID: 15472070, 17604724), and one mouse model that exhibits features of congenital heart disease including atrioventricular septal defect (PMID: 21330551). In summary, the evidence to support the gene-disease relationship between ID2 and congenital heart disease is disputed. More evidence is needed to either support or entirely refute the role ID2 plays in this disease.
