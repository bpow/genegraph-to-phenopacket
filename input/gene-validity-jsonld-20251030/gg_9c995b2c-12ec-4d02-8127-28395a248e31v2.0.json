To date, three publications have identified a total of 30 independent variants predicted to be deleterious of which eight predict premature truncation in the autosomal dominant form of pulmonary hypertension (Graf et al. 2018, Wang et al. 2019, Eyries et al. 2019). The gene disease relationship is supported by both mutation-specific in vitro studies (n=6), demonstration of aberrant BMP9 expression in patient cells (Wang et al, 2019), and rescue of PAH phenotypes by treatment of BMPR2 mutant mice with wild-type BMP9. No contradictory evidence has been reported. Recuration three years after the initial gene discovery report (March 16th, 2022) identified four additional PAH patients with heterozygous variants, three of which were missense variants with in vitro evidence of loss of function, and one nonsense variant (PMID 31661308, 33066286). Furthermore, a combined analysis of the PAH Biobank and the UK NIHR PAH cohort identified GDF2 as one of seven genes that were significantly associated with IPAH on a genome-wide basis (PMID 33971972). In summary, the evidence for GDF2 in the aetiology of pulmonary arterial hypertension is designated as definitive.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9c995b2c-12ec-4d02-8127-28395a248e31","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2d2e83fa-0af1-450f-af9c-5c61d4bc3106","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":[{"id":"cg:classificationChange"},{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"},{"id":"cg:newEvidence"},{"id":"cg:summaryChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2d2e83fa-0af1-450f-af9c-5c61d4bc3106_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10071","date":"2022-05-26T22:15:14.154Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2d2e83fa-0af1-450f-af9c-5c61d4bc3106_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10071","date":"2022-06-06T22:29:35.790Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2d2e83fa-0af1-450f-af9c-5c61d4bc3106_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2d2e83fa-0af1-450f-af9c-5c61d4bc3106_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ef0a2b1e-0a5a-4b6a-9463-74c436abff5c","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The experiment demonstrated inhibition of endothelial cell migration by exogenous BMP9, mediated by ALK1 (0.5 points).

Three mutations (V109L, S282fs and V423M) were chosen because patients with these mutations had early onset of disease. The other three mutations (R316S, S320C and A353T) were studied because the mutation carriers had severe clinical manifestations that decreased in a short period of time after diagnosis (supplementary table S3). Western blot demonstrated that the wild-type (WT) and five missense plasmids (V109L, V423M, R316S, S320C and A353T) expressed similar levels of pro-BMP9 protein either in cell lysis (supplementary figure S7) or in supernatants from human embryonic kidney HEK293E cells (figure 4a, right panel). However, a significant decrease in mature BMP9 was observed for all BMP9 mutants (figure 4a, left panel). For the truncated mutation S282fs, neither pro-BMP9 nor mature BMP9 could be detected (figure 4a and supplementary figure S7). These results were confirmed by ELISA assay (figure 4b). The mature BMP9 level was significantly decreased in the culture supernatant of HEK293E cells transfected with V109L, R316S and S320C, and was almost undetectable for S282fs, A353T and V423M. We then used the conditioned media from V109L-, R316S- and S320C-transfected cells to examine their ability in activating the BMP signalling pathway (figure 4c). BRE (BMP response element)-luciferase activity assays revealed that R316S exhibited decreased activity compared with WT BMP9. Furthermore, pre-treatment of WT BMP9 conditioned media protected pulmonary arterial endothelial cells (PAECs) from apoptosis induced by tumour necrosis factor-α in the presence of cycloheximide. However, all of the three mutants were unable to prevent PAEC apoptosis (figure 4d).","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30578397","rdfs:label":"Wang function 2"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fc46fa1f-b783-49da-99af-658d3756274f","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a91139b8-73cf-4479-bb5b-c5d9179b8953","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"The active form of BMP9 circulates in the blood and is crucial for the regulation of vasculature tone [18].

The BMP9 levels were significantly different among the three groups (p<0.0001, Kruskal–Wallis test) (figure 3). Compared with healthy controls, the plasma BMP9 level was lower in IPAH patients lacking BMP9 mutations (median (IQR) 19.8 (15.2–43.4) versus 36.2 (20.8–60.7) pg·mL−1; p=0.005, Mann–Whitney test). Importantly, the BMP9 level was even lower in BMP9 mutation carriers when compared with patients without mutations (median (IQR) 12.1 (8.6–21.8) versus 19.8 (15.2–43.4) pg·mL−1; p=0.002, Mann–Whitney test) (figure 3).
