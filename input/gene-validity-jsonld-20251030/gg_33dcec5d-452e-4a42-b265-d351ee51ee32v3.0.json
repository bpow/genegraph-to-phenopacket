SCP2 encodes two proteins, SCPx and SCP2 due to transcription initiation from two different promoters. SCPx is a peroxisome-associated thiolase involved in oxidation of branched-chain fatty acids while SCP2 is an intracellular lipid transfer protein. \n\nSCP2 was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive sterol carrier protein 2 deficiency in 2006 (Ferdinandusse et al, PMID: 16685654). Only three loss of function variants have been reported in this gene in relation to this disease. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. \n   \nSummary of Case Level Data (9 points):\nAt least 3 patients from unrelated families in 4 publications have been reported with the null  variants (PMID: 16685654, 26497993, 28033445, 37905191). The mechanism of disease is expected to be biallelic loss of function. \n  \nSummary of experimental data (4.5 points):\nThis gene-disease association is supported by mouse models that recapitulate human disease (PMID: 9553048, 15574183, 17068117). The protein is localized to the peroxisomes in hepatocytes (PMID: 2925789 ) and it interacts with PEX5 and has a role in peroxisomal fatty acid metabolism (PMID: 21375735). \n  \nThis gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the Peroxisomal GCEP on Nov 4, 2022. It was re-evaluated on February 7, 2025. As a result of this reevaluation, the classification increased from Moderate to Definitive with the addition of a new case and protein interaction evidence (PMIDs: 37905191, 36407094).
