AP4 deficiency results in severe early-onset developmental delay with motor and speech delay, intellectual disability, hypotonia in infancy followed by spastic paraplegia and later tetraplegia, microcephaly, and seizures (PMID: 32979048). At least 53 individuals from 40 families with biallelic AP4B1 nonsense, frameshift, splicing and missense variants leading to loss of protein function have been reported (PMIDs: 21620353, 29193663, 24781758, 32979048). The gene-disease association is further supported by biochemical and functional evidence demonstrating loss of AP4 complex function and impaired protein localization in fibroblasts from patients with biallelic AP4B1 loss-of-function variants, with the impaired protein localization rescued upon re-expression of AP4B1 (PMID: 31915823). In summary, the AP4B1 gene is definitively associated with autosomal recessive AP4 deficiency syndrome. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism Working Group on 07/26/2021 (SOP Version 8).","*AP4B1* loss-of-function variants were first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Adaptor Protein 4 (AP4) deficiency syndrome in 2011 (PMID: 21620353).
