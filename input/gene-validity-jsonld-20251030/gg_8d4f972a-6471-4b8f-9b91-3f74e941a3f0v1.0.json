Neurofibromatosis type 2 is characterized by the formation of benign bilateral or unilateral tumors (schwannomas, meningiomas, gliomas, and/or neurofibromas) in the central nervous, most commonly on the eighth cranial nerve (reviewed on www.ctf.org). Current evidence suggests a prevalence of Neurofibromatosis type 2 of 1 in 25,000 (www.ctf.org). Numerous variants have been reported, in both ClinVar and in LOVD (https://databases.lovd.nl/shared/genes/NF2).  Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, functional data, and model organisms. This gene-disease relationship has been studied for more than 20 years, therefore a significant amount of case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data is available and the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) and experimental evidence (6 points) has been reached. Note, this curation effort may not be exhaustive of all literature related to this gene-disease relationship. In particular, earlier compelling evidence suggestive of the gene-disease relationship, such as linkage data, may not be reflected in the current curation.\n\n\nThe mechanism for the gene-disease relationship is protein loss of function, as the NF2 protein product, termed Merlin or Schwannomin, is a tumor suppressor protein (Trofatter et al., 1993; PMID: 8453669). NF2 tumor suppressor function is regulated by the protein confirmation, with the closed form acting as the active tumor suppressor form (reviewed in Cooper and Giancotti, 2014 PMID:24726726). \n\nNF2 has been associated with multiple disease entities and/or phenotypes, including: \n(1) Meningioma, NF2-related, somatic (MIM: 607174)\n(2) Schwannomatosis, somatic\n\nOf note, these other phenotypes are noted as somatic, and therefore are not represented/ counted in this gene-disease relationship, and will be assessed separately. \n\n\nIn summary, NF2 is DEFINITIVELY associated with autosomal dominant Neurofibromatosis Type 2. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen General Gene Curation Expert Panel on February 27, 2019.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8d4f972a-6471-4b8f-9b91-3f74e941a3f0","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a185a859-a499-4c4a-bebe-996b16fb3cf3","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a185a859-a499-4c4a-bebe-996b16fb3cf3_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10026","date":"2019-02-27T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a185a859-a499-4c4a-bebe-996b16fb3cf3_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10026","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a185a859-a499-4c4a-bebe-996b16fb3cf3_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a185a859-a499-4c4a-bebe-996b16fb3cf3_ad_dn_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2db8c9ed-90f9-4ca4-99d0-8b161e2ddf48_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e522fa7e-704d-4f7d-83d1-a1e86b988e7f","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7913580","rdfs:label":"16215","ageType":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/","ageUnit":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/","detectionMethod":"The mutation of interest in NF2 was found by either SSCP or restriction enzyme digest, as well as PCR followed by direct sequencing, or a combination thereof.","firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypeFreeText":"“Criteria used to determine affected and unaffected status were those of the NIH (Mulvihill et al, 1990), as modified by Evans et al.

PBD1 resides in the region encoding amino acids 50-70, which carries a number of different pathogenic mutations for NF2. PBD2 resides in the region encoded by amino acids 425-450 (exons 12-13), again, another region harboring several mutations linked to NF2 development. Two NF2 patient derived mutations, also showed reduced binding to paxillin, emphasizing the importance of this association for Merlin function (Figure 4-5).\n\nExpression of Xpress-tagged NF2 with PBD mutations, indicates loss of NF2 protein membrane localization and polarization of rat Schwann cells.
