ADTKD-*MUC1* is characterized by slowly progressive tubulointerstitial kidney disease that leads to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) between ages 20-70 years. Age of end-stage kidney disease is variable and the reasons for this variability are unclear. Patients with ADTKD-*MUC1* have a bland urinary sediment without proteinuria or hematuria. The kidney ultrasound shows changes that are commonly found in chronic kidney disease and in general is not helpful in making this diagnosis. The key diagnostic parameter is a family history of chronic kidney disease. There are no other primary clinical manifestations of this disease (PMIDs: 24509297, 23946964; 32450155, 36250282). *MUC1* contains within the coding region a domain of multiple variable-number tandem repeats called the \"VNTR domain\" [NC_000001.10:g.(155160963_155162030)]. Mutational analysis of the *MUC1* VNTR region is extremely difficult due to its repetitive nature and high guanine/cytosine content (>80%) (PMIDs: 31116938, 27157321). In approximately 95% of cases the ADTKD-*MUC1* pathogenic variant is the insertion of an extra cytosine within a heptanucleotide cytosine tract of a VNTR unit (PMIDs: 23396133, 29967284, 29217307). Less common is the insertion of a different nucleotide (e.g., adenine, guanine). At least 7 unique variants in the VNTR domain of *MUC1*, and one variant located immediately before the VNTR (PMIDs: 29156055, 29967284), have been reported in humans. *MUC1* pathogenic variants result in the creation of the +1 frameshifted MUC1 protein (MUC1-fs). Expression of MUC1-fs is toxic to kidney cells and is responsible for slowly progressive chronic kidney disease, the sole manifestation of this disorder. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data and experimental data. Summary of Case Level Data: 12 POINTS. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 600 individuals (from more than 300 families) and segregated with the disease (PMIDs: 24509297, 23946964, 29217307, 29156055, 32450155, 36250282;). *MUC1* pathogenic variants causing ADTKD-*MUC1* result in the creation of the same frameshifted protein (MUC1-fs). This protein accumulates within the endoplasmic reticulum Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) (PMIDs: 31348885, 29967284, 36250282). In individuals with ADTKD-*MUC1*, MUC1-fs is found in all cell types normally expressing MUC1 (including breast, gastric mucosa, and lung) (PMID: 29967284); however, clinical manifestations of disease only occur in the kidney, where its deposition leads to accelerated apoptosis, tubular cell death, nephron dropout, and progressive chronic kidney disease. Summary of Experimental Evidence: 4 POINTS. This gene-disease association is supported by immunohistochemical studies of MUC1-fs in patient kidney biopsies, urine derived cells from patients, kidney organoids derived from ADTKD-*MUC1* patients and a MUC1-fs knock-in mouse model (PMIDs: 29967284, 29217307, 31348885). In summary, *MUC1* is definitively associated with autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease due to *MUC1* frameshifting mutations mainly in the VNTR (ADTKD-*MUC1*). This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Cystic and Ciliopathy Disorders GCEP Working Group on 01/13/2021 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0359c4b0-c3a1-4ed3-aea2-cb569a09d0ae","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/effa2b38-35c6-4071-b0d1-ce6970bb6ec1","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/effa2b38-35c6-4071-b0d1-ce6970bb6ec1_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10066","date":"2021-01-13T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/effa2b38-35c6-4071-b0d1-ce6970bb6ec1_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10066","date":"2023-04-03T13:20:02.883Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/effa2b38-35c6-4071-b0d1-ce6970bb6ec1_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/effa2b38-35c6-4071-b0d1-ce6970bb6ec1_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ba45b8ce-0c9b-4feb-a051-dbdb10c64f16","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e9d79176-fc40-47e9-af43-c46cba357b4c","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Mice carying mutant (MUC1-fs) allele developed progressive kidney disease while parental or wt (MUC1-wt) have no pathologic changes.

In critical region were excluded differences in CNVs, mutations in coding and non-coding regions by and large structural variation (del, ins, dup, inversions). At this point was concluded that the causal mutation is located in VNTR of MUC1 located in candidate region. The causal mutation was identified by clonning, subclonning, Sanger sequencing of individual subclones and de novo assembly for each MUC1 VNTR allele of affected individuals (in details described in PMID: 23396133).","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23396133","rdfs:label":"Family 3","estimatedLodScore":3.61,"family":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/941abf2a-90c7-4f43-b403-d25861a9ea95","type":"Family","rdfs:label":"Family 3","ethnicity":{"id":"cg:UnknownEthnicity"},"member":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a09a848e-6819-43c3-ae8b-e7401c1a7d78","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23396133","rdfs:label":"III-13","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":38,"allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/dd6c344a-7689-4827-8876-2448c58a64c3"},"detectionMethod":"Linkage analysis: Affymetrix 6.0 platform, Linkage mapping was performed using the Merlin package under a rare, autosomal dominant model. \nADTKD-MUC1 in this family is caused by insertion of one cytosine within MUC1 VNTR, typically missed by NGS due to poor sequence coverage, because of VNTR of MUC1 is GC-rich and contains 20-120 repetitions (one repetition consist of 60-bp).
