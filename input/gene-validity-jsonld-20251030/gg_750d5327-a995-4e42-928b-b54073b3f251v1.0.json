Clinical features of Christianson syndrome include microcephaly, profound intellectual impairment, global developmental delay, early-onset seizures, absent speech, craniofacial dysmorphism, and hyperkinesis. Christianson syndrome primarily affects hemizygous males, but heterozygous females can be mildly affected (Sinajon et al 2016). The mechanism of disease is loss of function. Missense and truncating variants in the SLC9A6 gene have been reported in Christianson syndrome patients, and variants have either arisen de novo or been inherited from a mildly affected mother. Two distinct mouse models lacking the SLC9A6 gene have had phenotypic features consistent with Christianson syndrome (Ouyang et al 2013, Xu et al 2017). In summary, SLC9A6 is definitively associated with Christianson syndrome in an X-linked manner. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.
