One missense variant that has been reported in one proband in one publication (PMID:24558368) is included in this curation. The mechanism of pathogenicity is unknown. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by an animal model and rescue animal model (PMID:10930438) In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the Congenital Heart Disease GCEP on November 27th, 2023 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/14a38dae-8e4e-48c1-8050-8325a3debc72","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/613d44ec-b161-43e6-9571-eecf427dc8de","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/613d44ec-b161-43e6-9571-eecf427dc8de_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10130","date":"2023-11-27T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/613d44ec-b161-43e6-9571-eecf427dc8de_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10130","date":"2024-10-07T20:20:10.555Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/613d44ec-b161-43e6-9571-eecf427dc8de_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/613d44ec-b161-43e6-9571-eecf427dc8de_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1e8fef36-dab9-4fc7-97a1-e320180a21d4","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Downgraded due to not recapitulating the phenotype.
