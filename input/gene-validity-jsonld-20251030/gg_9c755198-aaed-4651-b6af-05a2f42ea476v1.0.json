Patients diagnosed with the specific disease entity, retinitis pigmentosa 75 (MONDO:0014871, OMIM:615900), most commonly exhibited rod-cone dystrophy, nyctalopia, reduced visual acuity, bone spicule pigmentation of the retina, cataracts, and/or constriction of peripheral visual fields.  All of the probands were diagnosed during adulthood, although onset of ocular symptoms could occur during childhood. Many probands were also found to have hearing loss. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping & Splitting Working Group, the molecular mechanism (biallelic loss of function in the AGBL5 gene product) and mode of inheritance (autosomal recessive) were found to be consistent among unrelated patients with this diagnosis. The phenotypic variability among the diverse cases appeared to represent a spectrum of disease rather than separate disease entities. Therefore, these cases have been lumped for the purposes of this gene curation into a single disease entity, referred to as AGBL5-related retinopathy.\n\nThis curation includes 16 variants (9 missense, 2 frameshift, 4 nonsense, and 1 non-canonical splicing disruption) that have been collectively reported in 15 probands in 7 publications (PMID: 26720455, PMID: 26355662, PMID: 39672920, PMID: 35892439, PMID: 27764769, PMID: 27842159, and PMID: 38078364). Overall, the variant types suggest that the mechanism of pathogenicity is loss of function.\n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by multiple forms of experimental evidence, including biochemical studies indicating that *AGBL5* encodes an enzyme (also known as CCP5) that is responsible for deglutamylating tubulin (PMID: 24022482). Mouse models of *Agbl5* loss show disruption of this post-translational modification in the retinal cilia and recapitulate the abnormal retinal morphology in human probands (PMID: 39528655).\n\nIn conclusion, *AGBL5* has a Definitive association with AGBL5-related retinopathy. This classification has been clearly demonstrated in both research and diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time without the emergence of conflicting evidence. This classification was approved by the Retina GCEP on March 6th, 2025 (SOP Version 11).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9c755198-aaed-4651-b6af-05a2f42ea476","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cb9b01dc-10a2-4307-8b51-e956f71c4b65","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cb9b01dc-10a2-4307-8b51-e956f71c4b65_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10072","date":"2025-06-13T19:25:10.488Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cb9b01dc-10a2-4307-8b51-e956f71c4b65_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10072","date":"2025-05-01T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cb9b01dc-10a2-4307-8b51-e956f71c4b65_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cb9b01dc-10a2-4307-8b51-e956f71c4b65_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e298449f-efdc-426b-9770-411f02d8f54b","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Downscored due to lack of phenotypes.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/18dc1b1a-2cf0-49bb-902f-c86af8018bf9","type":"Finding","dc:description":"The abnormal retinal morphology found in the model recapitules the affected retinal morphology in human probands.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39528655","rdfs:label":"Mercey et al. 2024","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cb9b01dc-10a2-4307-8b51-e956f71c4b65_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/be6c76a5-a98a-4a56-af7a-dceb12df44ff","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a41449ae-874d-446a-9a0e-e36260c11a9c","type":"Finding","dc:description":" The process of glutamylation in the model is representative of the activity that is seen in human retinas.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24022482","rdfs:label":"Berezniuk et al. 2013","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cb9b01dc-10a2-4307-8b51-e956f71c4b65_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c88674db-f8d8-4056-8488-11f713c597f1_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7455d466-7960-4b03-b93f-14c1d93f81d2","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":3.0,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7455d466-7960-4b03-b93f-14c1d93f81d2_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27842159","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/770ac043-3f3e-4454-ab85-e47387317252","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_021831.6(AGBL5):c.1775G>A (p.Trp592Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA1567964"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":3.0},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c88674db-f8d8-4056-8488-11f713c597f1","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27842159","rdfs:label":" Patient F1-IV:3","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":32,"allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/770ac043-3f3e-4454-ab85-e47387317252"},"detectionMethod":"WES.","phenotypeFreeText":"Patient F1-IV:3 was referred to the Rotterdam Eye Hospital at age 32 with end-stage RP complicated by cystoid maculopathy.

Prior to presenting at our clinic, he was observed to have retinal pigment and bilateral optic nerve edema. CT, MRI, and MRV were all normal. Lumbar puncture showed monocytes and lymphocytes but was otherwise normal. Given the lack of radiologic abnormalities and some recent weight gain, the diagnosis of pseudotumor cerebri was made and he was pre-scribed acetazolamide.\n\nDuring the visit at our clinic, the patient reported a history of nyctalopia and some floaters in the right eye. He recalled, after starting the acetazolamide, some intermittent photopsia and visual obscurations. He was otherwise well and had lost 12 pounds over the last 2 months at the request of his doctor.\n\nOn our examination, best corrected visual acuity was 20/20–2 in each eye (−3.75 + 2.25 × 80 OD, −4.00 + 2.25 × 95 OS).

Fundus examination showed “bone spicule” pigmentary clumping scattered for 360 degrees in the mid periphery of each eye, internal limiting membrane irregularities over the macula, and a posterior vitreous detachment in the right eye (Figure 1a). The optic nerves were raised and irregular, consistent with optic nerve drusen (Figure 1b). There was no active edema or subretinal fluid.\n\nOCT showed a distinct loss of photoreceptors outside the central macula. The subfoveal ellipsoid zone was also patchy in each eye (Figure 1c). Fundus autofluoresence (FAF) showed a hyperfluorescent ring within the macula and blocking of pigment beyond the macula (Figure 2a). Goldmann visual field testing showed an enlarged blind spot in each eye and generalized constriction of the isopters, in particular the I4e (Figure 2b). Multifocal electroretinogram (ERG) was severely abnormal with some central sparing. Full field ERG was isoelectric.

She is the second of two sisters born to reportedly non-consanguineous parents from a small local community. Her medical history is insignificant with no cases of hearing loss and/or RP in the family (Fig. 1a).\n\nThe patient, from Italy, presented night blindness since the age of 14 years, and received a diagnosis of RP at the age of 19 years. At the last ophthalmological examination (55 years), she had a hand motion visual acuity in both eyes, an RP fundus with bone-spicule pigmentation (BSP) in mid-periphery, and macular atrophy (Fig. 2a). FAF imaging revealed reduced autofluorescence at the posterior pole, with focal areas of absent autofluorescence surrounding the optic disc and in the macular area (Fig. 2a). SD-OCT imaging revealed a diffuse retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) dystrophy with epiretinal membranes but without cystoid macular edemas (CME) (Fig. 2a). Scotopic and photopic ERG responses were unrecordable in both eyes (Table 2), and she had bilateral pseudophakia. She also suffers from post-verbal hearing loss with a reported onset at the age of 18 years and she is currently using hearing aids (auditory prostheses). The most recent audiological examination confirmed the diagnosis of moderate, bilateral and symmetric sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) with a Pure Tone Average (PTA) of 59 dB in both sides and a sloping audiogram at intermediate-high frequencies (500 Hz–8000 Hz) (Fig. 3).

Slit lamp examination was normal with the exception of bilateral, dense, superior posterior subcapsular cataract, which did not involve the visual axis. Goldmann applanation tonometry was normal. Fundus examination showed moderate optic atrophy, moderate retinal vessel attenuation, almost 360 degrees of “bone spicule” pigmentary clumping, attenuation of the retinal vessels, and bilateral preserved central foveal islands of normal retina (Figure 4a). No optic nerve drusen were seen in the fundus examination. OCT showed an almost complete loss of photoreceptors, except for the subperifovea in both eyes (Figure 4b). FAF of the right eye was of poor quality. FAF of the left eye had marked peripapillary hypofluorescence (Figure 4c).
