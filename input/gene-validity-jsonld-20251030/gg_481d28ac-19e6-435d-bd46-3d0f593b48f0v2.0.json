Congenital defects found in VCRL2 include segmentation defects, cardiac defects such as hypoplastic heart, hypoplastic kidneys, missing kidneys, clinodactyly, radial deviation, and polydactyly. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. At least 14 unique variants (e.g. missense, nonsense, frameshift, splicing, and large deletion) have been reported in 11 probands from 5 publications (PMIDs: 28792876, 33942433, 31923704, 17334708, 34200361). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 1 additional family member. The gene *KYNU* encodes Kynureninase, one of the enzymes responsible for the biosynthesis of NAD from Trpytophan. This gene-disease association is further supported by its biochemical function in the kynurenine pathway (PMID: 8706755) and a knockout mouse model (PMID: 28792876) which recapitulates the phenotype on a NAD-restricted diet. In summary, *KYNU* is definitively associated with autosomal recessive vertebral, cardiac, renal, and limb defects syndrome 2. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.\n\nThis gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the Aminoacidopathy GCEP on 07/10/2020. It was reevaluated on 08/01/2022. As a result of this reevaluation, the classification increased from Moderate to Definitive with the addition of 5 new cases (PMIDs: 33942433 and 34200361).\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/481d28ac-19e6-435d-bd46-3d0f593b48f0","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/70d2f25f-b3f0-4f1b-b7bf-ad8d3562c959","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":[{"id":"cg:newEvidence"},{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"},{"id":"cg:sopChange"},{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},{"id":"cg:classificationChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/70d2f25f-b3f0-4f1b-b7bf-ad8d3562c959_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10011","date":"2022-10-14T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/70d2f25f-b3f0-4f1b-b7bf-ad8d3562c959_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10011","date":"2022-10-17T14:39:06.669Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/70d2f25f-b3f0-4f1b-b7bf-ad8d3562c959_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/70d2f25f-b3f0-4f1b-b7bf-ad8d3562c959_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9d20d8d0-7e02-4cc4-8406-caf9380f63e9","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Insertion of the human KYNU coding sequence into a eukaryotic expression vector yielded relatively high amounts of the active enzyme in human embryonic kidney HEK-293 cells.
