{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/667d2f2a-b9ac-4d81-aed0-a862565cd7abv1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"The relationship between RNASEH1 and Leigh syndrome spectrum was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of September 21, 2020. The RNASHE1 gene encodes ribonuclease H1, an endonuclease, present in both the nucleus and mitochondria, that digests the RNA component of RNA-DNA hybrids. However, the nucleus has a second ribonuclease (RNase H2) that mitochondria do not, therefore the RNase H1 enzyme plays a critical role in mitochondrial DNA replication and maintenance.\n\nThe RNASEH1 gene has been reported only once in relation to autosomal recessive Leigh syndrome spectrum, in 2019 (PMID: 31271879).  Of note, many individuals with RNASEH1-related disease have chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO) as well as a more generalized, cerebral, cerebellar, and brainstem atrophy distinct from what is seen in Leigh syndrome spectrum. \n\nEvidence supporting the gene-disease relationship between RNASEH1 and Leigh syndrome spectrum includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included one variant identified in one case from one publication (PMID: 31271879). No segregation data were available. Loss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease association is also supported by biochemical function, functional alternation in patient cells, and animal models (PMIDs: 28215579, 26094573, 12667461).\n\nIn summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on September 21, 2020 (SOP Version 7).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/667d2f2a-b9ac-4d81-aed0-a862565cd7ab","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fcf8b7a4-7bd5-45fe-824c-6a90825620f7","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fcf8b7a4-7bd5-45fe-824c-6a90825620f7_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2021-01-14T21:38:36.108Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fcf8b7a4-7bd5-45fe-824c-6a90825620f7_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2021-01-14T21:38:24.328Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fcf8b7a4-7bd5-45fe-824c-6a90825620f7_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0c10a425-a95a-477f-a3e4-b7b9cff7b18a_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Functional evidence: 26094573: Reyes et al.
