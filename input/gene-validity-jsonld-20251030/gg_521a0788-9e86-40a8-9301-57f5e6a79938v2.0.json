One missense variant occurring in the last exon and resulting in an extension has been reported to segregate with disease in a family with hearing loss. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data and experimental data. This gene-disease association is supported by multiple mouse models, functional alteration studies, protein interaction studies indicating that GRXCR2 interacts with TPRN, and inner ear expression studies (Avenarious et al. 2012, 30157177; Avenarius 2012, a PhD thesis; Liu et al. 2018, 30380417). In summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease association. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hearing Loss Working Group on 3/26/2021.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/521a0788-9e86-40a8-9301-57f5e6a79938","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/207f12b7-3148-4a8f-88f8-f78ac5bb294c","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","changes":[{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},{"id":"cg:sopChange"},{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"},{"id":"cg:newEvidence"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/207f12b7-3148-4a8f-88f8-f78ac5bb294c_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2021-03-26T15:57:58.345Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/207f12b7-3148-4a8f-88f8-f78ac5bb294c_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2021-03-26T15:57:48.643Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/207f12b7-3148-4a8f-88f8-f78ac5bb294c_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/207f12b7-3148-4a8f-88f8-f78ac5bb294c_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e6de8532-0006-4d47-9d12-171538ebb344","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ad2a85ba-2d63-40c1-8893-f9d2a9cad23a","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Found that GRXCR2 was concentrated at the base of the stereocilia and was critical for taperin localization using whole mount staining","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30380417","rdfs:label":"Stereocilia expression of GRXCR2","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/64135210-3ab2-4ec4-b72c-377149831a18","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/878dfb3a-efef-4113-8c17-c34c0b3d152a","type":"Finding","dc:description":"RT-PCR analysis of mice missing exon 1 of GRXCR2 and heterozygous mice showed that heterozygous and WT mice expressed GRXCR2 in the sterocilia of the cochlea while KO mice did not have full length transcripts of GRXCR2 and exhibited disorganized sterocilia","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30157177","rdfs:label":"GRXCR2 cochlear expression","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f88c7355-b124-4052-8a16-33a01957ce3f","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6c26599c-2b0f-4169-8b50-358793464122","type":"Finding","dc:description":"This study showed that GRXCR2 forms a complex with TPRN by geneticlaly engineering mice (using CRISPR cas9) that were TPRN deficient, GRXCR2 deficient, or both TPRN deficient and GRXCR2 deficient.
