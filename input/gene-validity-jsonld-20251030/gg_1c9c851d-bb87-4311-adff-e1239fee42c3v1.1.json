Genetic variants in this gene cause primary systemic carnitine deficiency, an autosomal recessive disorder. Homozygote or compound heterozygote variants in SLC22A5 have been identified in unexplained SCD or resuscitated cardiac arrest cases with abbreviation of the QT interval and without overt extra-cardiac manifestations (PMIDs 26190315, 31472821). Because the QT interval abbreviation was reversible by oral carnitine supplementation, the Expert Panel viewed this gene as a SQTS-mimic but as a cause of true SQTS classified it as ‘disputed’.
