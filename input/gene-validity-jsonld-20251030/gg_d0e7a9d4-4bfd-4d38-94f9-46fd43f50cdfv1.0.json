The SMARCAL1 gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Schimke immune-osseous dysplasia (SIOD) in 2002 (Boerkoel et al., PMID 11799392). At least 13 unique variants (nonsense, frameshift, splice, missense) have been reported in humans. Diagnostic features include spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia, renal dysfunction, lymphocytopenia and/or T-cell immunodeficiency. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least eight probands in at least four publications (Bétous et al., 2002, PMID 11799392; Dekel et al., 2008, PMID 18356746; Liu et al., 2017, PMID 29282041; Jin et al., 2019, PMID 31275356). Variants were reported in unaffected carrier parents and were not identified in additional affected family members. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. This gene-disease relationship is supported by a zebrafish model that recapitulates phenotype (Huang et al., 2010, PMID 20036229) and in vitro rescue studies in patient fibroblasts (Bansbach et al., 2010, 21327070). In summary, ​SMARCAL1​​ is definitively associated with autosomal recessive Schimke immune-osseous dysplasia. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Syndromic Disorders Gene Curation Expert Panel on the meeting date 19Feb2021 (SOP Version 8).\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d0e7a9d4-4bfd-4d38-94f9-46fd43f50cdf","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/58700233-acb6-4ea8-911b-b3f474906aaa","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/58700233-acb6-4ea8-911b-b3f474906aaa_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10060","date":"2021-07-30T13:05:48.284Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/58700233-acb6-4ea8-911b-b3f474906aaa_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10060","date":"2021-07-30T13:06:00.187Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/58700233-acb6-4ea8-911b-b3f474906aaa_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/58700233-acb6-4ea8-911b-b3f474906aaa_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1ceaea1c-b4eb-4783-9b13-55c8573e408d","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/20fc53b1-c671-404b-b914-d1fd49c1b99b","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Authors utilized AB and Tg (fli1:GFP) zebrafish for this research. Evaluating the smarcal1 cDNA of Zebrafish authors were able to determine that 62.2% identity and 78.5% similarity to human SMARCAL1 (Fig 1A). Of particular interest is the consistency of the domains found in mammalian SMARCAL1, including two HepA-related protein (HARP) domains at N-terminus that exhibit ssDNA-dependent ATPase activity, one SNF2 family N-termial (SNF2_N) domain that involves in transcription regulation, DNA repair, DNA recombination and chromatin unwinding, as well as one helicase superfamily C-termial (Helicase_C domain near the C terminus. Rt-PCR showed the smarcal1 transcript was found from 1-cell through adult (Fig 1C).\n\nEmbryos were injected with smarcal1 MO1 and no obvious gross morphological abnormality during the first 24 h was detected (Figs 3A-C). At 2 days post fertilization (dpf), development of defects were observed in the smarcal1 MO1 and MO2 morphants. By 4 dpf morphants had severe gross morphological defects, death, delayed growth, heart edema, shorter trunk, smaller head and eyes, and lower heart rates compared to WT and control MO embryos (Fig 3D-F, Supplementary Fig S3B).\n\nAlcian blue staining showed WT and control MO injected zebrafish revealed normal cartilage development. Smarcal1 morphants had severely reduced growth of pharyngeal cartilages (Supplementary Fig. S4A-D). \n\nUsing O-dianisidine staining, knockdowns were found to have fewer red blood cells compared to uninjected and control MO embryos (Fig 3G-I). \n\nMicroangiography showed that parachordal vessel and sub-intestinal vessel were normal in uninjected and control MO embryos, but absent in smarcal1 morphants at 3 dpf. This demonstrates alterations in vessel formation/maintenance and may be consistent with migraines, cerebral ischemia, and transient ischemic attacks, which may be from arteriosclerosis which are exhibited in SIOD patients.\n\nCell cycle analysis showed uninjected and control MO embryos with 62% and 60% of cells at G0/G1, 15 and 16% at S, and 23 and 23% at G2/M phase. Smarcal1 morphants exhibited cell accumulation at G0/G1 phase at 91% and reduction at both S and G2/M phase indicating that the cell cycle was arrested in morphants. Using TUNEL to detect apoptotic cells in embryos and tracking over 14 to 34 hpf, positive TUNEL cells were dramatically increased in the brain, eyes, trunk, tail and ICM (Figs. 5V, W, Z, Z) indicating developmental defects of smarcal1 morphants may be partially caused by increased apoptosis.\n\nBased on the cell cycle regulation E2F6, a cell cycle regulating transcription factor, was investigated. E2F binding sites in both human and zebrafish smarcal1 were identified (Supplementary Fig S6). A SMARCAL1 promoter sequence containing E2F binding sites was cloned into pGL3 vector and luciferase reporter assay was done. E2F6 significantly suppressed SMARCAL1 transactivity by over-expression of E2F6 (Fig 7b). Transactivity of SMARCAL1 promoter sequence without E2F binding sites was not altered (Fig 7B). The mRNA level was examined in E2F6 transfected 293T cells by RT-PCR. Over-expression of E2F6 decreased SMARCAl1 expression (Figs 7C, D) and indicates E2F6 suppresses SMARCAL1. In vivo testing by injecting E2F6 mRNA into 1-2 cell zebrafish embryos. Embryo development was significantly disrupted and resulted in phenotypes similar to those observed in smarcal1 morphants (Figs 7E, F). \n\nZebrafish knockdowns caused multi-system developmental defects including growth restriction, craniofacial abnormalities, reduced thymic development, and defects in both primitive and definitive hematopoiesis and angiogenesis.

Silencing SMARCAL1 causes hypersensitivity in cells to replication stress agents like hydroxyurea (HU), camptothecin, and aphidicolin. Leading authors to hypothesize that SMARCAL1 activity is critical for genome maintenance during replication. Replication stress triggers SMARCAL1 localization to sites of stalled replication with RPA and other stalled fork markers. Authors aimed to identify if loss of the genome maintenance function of SMARCAL1 at stalled replication forks is associated with SIOD disease. \n\nExpression of the patient variant in cells where the endogenous allele is silenced using RNAi fails to complement the loss of SMARCAL1 maintenance activity. The SIOD patient cells undergo mitosis more slowly than wild-type cells. Authors suggest this establishes a link between SIOD disease and a defect in replication stress response.\n\nIf loss of maintenance activity of SMARCAL1 causes SIOD, authors suggested that an increase in DNA damage during S-phase in SIOD patient cells would be expected. Using patient fibroblasts derived from SIOD patient authors found elevated levels of γH2AX, which is normally the result of damage signaling in the cell. The patient derived fibroblasts were able to be rescued with the introduction of WT SMARCAL1 (fig 1A). While the p.Arg764Gln and SMARCAL1-deltaN (truncated SMARCAL1 that only includes replication protein A (RPA) binding site) were not able to rescue the cell and reduce the amount of γH2AX. Re-introduction of SMARCAL1 to SIOD fibroblasts reduced RPA phosphorylation following HU treatment compared to cells only expressing the empty vector (Fig. 1B)\n\nAuthors suggest that SMARCAL1 activity is important for preventing degeneration of DNA forks and that the absence of this activity contributes to SIOD.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21327070","rdfs:label":"Patient Fibroblast Rescue","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:PhenotypeRescue"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellRescueCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":3},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/58700233-acb6-4ea8-911b-b3f474906aaa_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7a8a89fb-131c-4771-a2f7-4dc6b2261790","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"While the data is consistent for the missense variants.

Authors generated a series of truncated SMARCAL1 proteins and examined the affinity for a forked DNA substrate (Fig. 3A). Authors were able to identify that truncations including the Hep-A-related protein (HARP) domains severely altered the DNA-binding and ATPase activities of SMARCAL1 (Fig. 3B-E). Authors evaluated HARP domain alterations (Fig 4A) and found that deleting HARP1 allows for SMARCAL1 to bind with slightly reduced affinity compared with WT (Fig. 4B, C). Deleting HARP2 (either alone or combined with HARP1) severely altered DNA binding and ATPase activation. Authors also altered residues within each domain as point mutations and found that the missense alterations demonstrated the same DNA-binding and ATPase activity consistent with the corresponding deletions (Fig 4G-I). The missense alterations in HARP1 slightly impaired annealing helicase activity, while missense alterations in the HARP2 domain completely abolished SMARCAL1's ability to anneal an RPA-coated plasmid substrate (Fig 4). Authors indicate that HARP2 is critical for DNA-binding, ATPase, and annealing helicase activities. - functional alteration in non-patient cells\n\nSMARCAL1 was also shown to bind to 3 and 4 way Holliday junctions (Fig 6A, B) and both substrates activated SMARCAL1 ATPase (Fig. 6C). With the ability to bind and stimulate ATPase activity authors also evaluated SMARCAL1's ability to induce branch migration. Using synthetic Holliday junctions of two homologous and two heterologous arms (like prior branch migration studies) authors found SMARCAL1 does catalyze branch migration in an ATP-dependent manner (Fig 6E, F). Using SIOD patient-derived ATPase-defective variant (p.Arg764Gln) authors were able to show the variant failed to promote branch migration even with the ability to bind DNA (Fig. 6G, H). Authors also tested the previous HARP missense variants and found HARP1 was able to branch-migrate the Holliday junction like WT, while the HARP2 variant severely reduced activity (Fig 6I, J)\n\nThe role of SMARCAL1 at stalled replication forks was also evaluated. Authors evaluated the SMARCAL1 affinity to model forks with no nascent DNA strands, a leading strand, a lagging strand, or both. SMARCAL1 was able to bind and be activated by each of these structures (Fig. 7A-C). A substrate monitor was used to evaluate fork regression (Fig 7D) and SMARCAL1 was found to catalyze displacement of \"nascent\" DNA strands and annealing of the parental strands (Fig. 7E, F).
