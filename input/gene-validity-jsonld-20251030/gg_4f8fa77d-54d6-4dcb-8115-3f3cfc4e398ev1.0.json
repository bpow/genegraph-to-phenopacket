CVID is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous entity, primarily presenting as an antibody deficiency with low levels of serum IgG, IgA, and/or IgM, functional antibody deficiency, and recurrent sinopulmonary bacterial infections. In addition, non-infectious complications linked to underlying immune dysregulation are present in a subset of patients. One missense variant (Ser551Asn) has been reported in one proband in one publication (PMID: 27016798), segregating in two additional affected family members. An additional patient with the IRF2BP2 c.1180A>C; p.Thr394Pro variant has been reported in an individual affected with CIVD in an abstract for the American college of allergy, asthma & immunology 2018 annual scientific meeting (Joseph 2018; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anai.2018.09.308). This gene-disease association is supported by its role as a transcriptional corepressor, participating in the adaptive immune response by influencing the maintenance, production, and secretion of cytokines (PMID: 21576369), and the alteration of B-cell maturation found in patient cells (PMID: 27016798). In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4f8fa77d-54d6-4dcb-8115-3f3cfc4e398e","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/025487e5-9447-4c7b-88ad-f650103e09cf","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/025487e5-9447-4c7b-88ad-f650103e09cf_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10080","date":"2021-03-16T12:55:17.978Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/025487e5-9447-4c7b-88ad-f650103e09cf_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10080","date":"2021-03-16T12:54:03.252Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/025487e5-9447-4c7b-88ad-f650103e09cf_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/025487e5-9447-4c7b-88ad-f650103e09cf_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/48347eb1-7235-47d6-82f9-a2bed90ea4ce","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The normal function of IRF2BP2 in B-cell maturation was not well defined but in vitro decreased B-cell maturation, as shown here, is common in immunodeficiency disorders.","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1794e100-a595-4135-b3f0-56baa6f4fb4b","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Stimulation of the patient’s PBMC with IL-21, CD40L, and CPG for 7 days showed decreased formation of B-cell plasmablasts (CD19+CD27+CD38high) in comparison with control PBMC in response to all stimulants.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27016798","rdfs:label":"B-cell maturation"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/025487e5-9447-4c7b-88ad-f650103e09cf_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c7644011-29ac-452b-b8a1-ce30503bf48a","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Demonstrated that IRF2BP2 is a partner of NFAT1, an important regulator of T cells activation and differentiation.
