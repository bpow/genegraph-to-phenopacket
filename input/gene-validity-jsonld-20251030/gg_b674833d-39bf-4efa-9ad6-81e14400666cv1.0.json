The BTD gene encodes biotinidase, the enzyme responsible for recycling biotin. Biotin is an essential vitamin and coenzyme for four mitochondrial carboxylases necessary for metabolism in humans: acetyl-CoA carboxylase, propionyl-CoA carboxylase, 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase, and pyruvate carboxylase.\n\nThe BTD gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Leigh syndrome spectrum (LSS) in 2008 (PMID: 18645204). It is important to note, however, that there were many earlier reports of biotinidase deficiency resulting in a phenotype consistent with LSS, however genetic testing was not routinely performed at the time of these early case reports. By the time genetic testing was more widely utilized, biotinidase deficiency had been adopted into many newborn screening programs and was being treated presymptomatically, therefore preventing manifestation of LSS. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included one variant identified in two cases from two publications (PMIDs: 21907891, 18645204), although as stated above there are many other probands in whom LSS was prevented with biotin treatment. No segregation data were available. Loss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease association is also supported by biochemical function, expression, and animal models (PMIDs: 27977873, 25613900, 21051254).\n\nIn summary, there is currently limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. However, the expert panel agreed to increase this gene-disease association to moderate, primarily due to the fact that there would be many more cases to score if this was not a treatable condition that is screened for at birth in many countries. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on October 12, 2020 (SOP Version 7).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b674833d-39bf-4efa-9ad6-81e14400666c","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/74599afe-02f9-4225-9e50-63306f04a552","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/74599afe-02f9-4225-9e50-63306f04a552_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2021-06-14T14:03:27.018Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/74599afe-02f9-4225-9e50-63306f04a552_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2021-06-14T14:04:17.015Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"There is currently limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship.

These symptoms were preceded by 5 days of an upper respiratory infection that was treated symptomatically.\nThe child’s past medical history was unremarkable. He had an uneventful perinatal course. He attained most developmental milestones at the appropriate age. However, his speech was delayed based on his inability to combine words\nand his limited vocabulary. His parents are first cousins, and the mother had 1 miscarriage at 2 months gestation. An 8- month-old sibling was healthy. MRI of the spine revealed nonenhancing cervicothoracic cord lesion. His cerebrospinal fluid showed normal cellular and biochemical markers, and cultures of his blood, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid were negative. He was diagnosed with transverse myelitis and treated with a 5-day course of steroids followed by intravenous immunoglobulin (total dose of 2 g/kg). Despite this treatment, he continued to deteriorate over the ensuing few weeks. Subsequently, he was unable to stand or walk. Child was lethargic and tachypneic with normal oxygen saturation and normal vital signs. There was sparsity of the hair without skin rash or hepatosplenomegaly. He was normocephalic with normal cranial nerve function and a normal funduscopic examination.He had truncal hypotonia with severe head lag. Motor examination revealed decreased strength in the lower extremities to trace movement and 3/5 in the upper extremities. There was no evidence of muscle atrophy. Tone was increased in all limbs with deep tendon reflexes were increased at the patella, biceps, and triceps bilaterally. There were few beats of bilateral ankle clonus with an extensor plantar response (Babinski reflex). Sensory level could not be accurately determined due to poor cooperation; however, the patient had decreased response to pain in all limbs. Abdominal reflexes were decreased. The bladder was palpable and the anal tone was present, however, he did have significant constipation. MRI of the brain and spine showed abnormal signal intensity in the midbrain and cervicothoracic spinal cord (Figures 2A and 3A). Magnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed a lactate peak at 1.33 ppm on the right basal ganglia voxel (Figure 4A). A flash visual evoked potential study showed no abnormalities. An auditory brainstem evoked response demonstrated delayed I–III interpeak latency in the right ear and absent potentials in the left ear suggestive of disruption in the peripheral pathway between the acoustic nerve and the pons. An arterial blood gas revealed metabolic acidosis overcompensated by respiratory alkalosis (pH = 7.51, pCO2 = 20 mmol/L, HCO3 – = 8 mmol/L). Serum and cerebrospinal fluid lactate concentrations were elevated at 6 mmol/L and 9 mmol/L, respectively. Plasma ammonia was mildly elevated at 99 μmol/L. Tandem mass spectroscopy of his blood revealed elevated hydroxy C5-carnitine concentration with normal free carnitine. Urine gas chromatography mass spectroscopy showed an elevated 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid concentration. Serum biotinidase activity was undetectable on 2 occasions.\nThe child was diagnosed with profound biotinidase deficiency and started on oral biotin (15 mg twice daily). There was considerable improvement in mental status and motor function during the first few weeks of therapy. At 6 months following the initiation of therapy, he was able to ambulate independently and his hair had grown back. However, he continued to exhibit mild residual spasticity in his lower limbs. Repeat tandem mass spectroscopy of his urine\nand his serum lactate were normal. An MRI showed significant resolution of the midbrain and cervicothoracic lesions (Figures 2B and 3B). Magnetic resonance spectroscopy showed significant reduction in lactate peak and improvement of N-acetylaspartate/choline ratio reflecting restoration of neuronal integrity and energy stores (Figure 4B). His auditory brainstem evoked response became normal. The child’s younger brother had normal biotinidase activity.","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6b071be0-a887-48c7-b325-7e6d82bd0d15_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18645204","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c5fdab99-132f-41d8-8dff-461230aaa3b2","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001370658.1(BTD):c.1279C>T (p.His427Tyr)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA278332"}}}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3d797398-9c4f-42fc-9962-ee7c1e2b3f64_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Applied reduced default score - no functional evidence, seen in two unrelated individuals, in silico predictions supportive of pathogenicity: VarSome: Pathogenic computational verdict based on 7 pathogenic predictions from DEOGEN2, FATHMM-MKL, M-CAP, MVP, MutationTaster, PrimateAI and SIFT vs 4 benign predictions from DANN, EIGEN, MutationAssessor and REVEL.

Birth and developmental history were unremarkable, nonconsanguineous family. Presented age 7 years with progressive weakness in all four limbs and breathing and swallowing difficulties, frequent falls and intermittent \"sighing\" respirations. Quadraplegic with the lower limbs more prominently affected but also upper limb weakness. Examination revealed a normal sensorium, hypophonic speech, bulbar palsy, and spastic quadriplegia. He did not manifest hearing impairment, skin rashes, or alopecia. History of similar illness evaluated elsewhere aged 5 years. Demonstrated no evidence of infection, and investigations involving a hemogram and blood culture were normal. His arterial blood gas was normal. A routine examination of cerebrospinal fluid produced normal results. However, his cerebrospinal fluid lactate levels were significantly elevated (at 77.7 mg/dL; normal range, 10.8-18.9 mg/dL). Multiplanar, multi-echo plain and contrast magnetic resonance imaging scans of the brain and spine were performed, including single and three-dimensional multivoxel spectroscopy. Magnetic resonance imaging indicated diffuse T2 hyperintensity, with involvement of the septum pellucidum, the posterior part of the corpus callosum, and fornix in the midline, with bilateral symmetric lesions in the medial thalamus, dorsal midbrain, periaqueductal gray matter, dorsal pons, and medulla (Fig 1). His optic tracts and optic chiasm also demonstrated signal changes. Diffusion-weighted imaging revealed restricted diffusion at the septum pellucidum, medial thalamus, and fornix. Spinal cord lesions extended from the medulla up to the T12 vertebral level (Fig 2). Magnetic resonance spectroscopy through the lesions demonstrated a mild reduction in the N-acetyl aspartate peak, with the presence of a lactate peak. Moreover, the spectra through the ventricles and basal ganglia indicated a lactate peak. Nerve conduction studies demonstrated borderline slow lower limb conduction velocities.His biotinidase levels were significantly low (1.0 nmol of PABA liberated/minute/mL; normal range, 12-17 nmol of PABA liberated/minute/mL). He was treated with supplements of oral biotin, 20 mg daily. In about 1 week, bulbar signs showed evidence of resolution, and after 1 month of treatment, he regained ambulation. At follow-up after 3 months of treatment, the only evident abnormality was residual spasticity of the bilateral triceps surae muscles.","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3d797398-9c4f-42fc-9962-ee7c1e2b3f64_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21907891","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c5fdab99-132f-41d8-8dff-461230aaa3b2"}}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/74599afe-02f9-4225-9e50-63306f04a552_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/74599afe-02f9-4225-9e50-63306f04a552_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2893b595-a521-48fb-b6eb-0d31c9e4c22e","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8bb68712-21a3-46f3-8fb5-63e602a6eeb9","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Recapitulates phenotypes seen in human subjects.
