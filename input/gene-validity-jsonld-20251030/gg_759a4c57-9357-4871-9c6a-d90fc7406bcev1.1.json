KIZ is a protein necessary for centromere stabilization during mitosis. Mutations in *KIZ* are thought to cause defects in photoreceptor connecting cilium, leading to retinal disorders such as RP. There is significant heterogeneity in RP,  however patients with *KIZ*-associated retinopathy have been reported to have fundus findings typical of RP, that is, vascular attenuation and peripheral retinal atrophy with pigment migration. A perifoveal ring of increased autofluorescence on fundus autofluorescence imaging and a rod-cone dystrophy have also been described.\n\nFour suspected pathogenic variants (two nonsense, one frameshift, and one found in the *KIZ* initiation codon) that have been reported in 14 probands across six publications (PMIDs: 24680887, 29057815, 32052671, 31556760, 28837078, 32098976) are included in this curation. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be biallelic loss of function. \n\nThis gene-disease association is also supported by experimental evidence that *KIZ* is non-specifically expressed in retina tissue (PMID:25613900). Multiple RT-PCR experiments have confirmed the expression of *KIZ* in human retina samples (PMIDs: 24680887 and 29057815). Finally, using microarray and RT-PCR data, Strunnikova et al. found that *KIZ* was highly expressed in the RPE layer of the retina (PMID: 20360305). Experiments have also shown that KIZ colocalizes with the cilium markers α-tubulin and γ-tubulin in the basal body of cilia in photoreceptors in mouse retina (PMID: 29057815) and in human fibroblasts (PMID: 24680887).\n\nIn summary, *KIZ* is definitively associated with KIZ-related retinopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Retina GCEP on February 2, 2023 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/759a4c57-9357-4871-9c6a-d90fc7406bce","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f0705bfe-f3fa-495f-8a5d-77561d0afe91","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f0705bfe-f3fa-495f-8a5d-77561d0afe91_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10072","date":"2023-02-02T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f0705bfe-f3fa-495f-8a5d-77561d0afe91_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10072","date":"2024-06-29T04:15:33.644Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["DiseaseNameUpdate"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f0705bfe-f3fa-495f-8a5d-77561d0afe91_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f0705bfe-f3fa-495f-8a5d-77561d0afe91_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b0f0731b-3fd9-4520-a88c-1e0752c5221f","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e9ae321e-c6eb-4adc-abb8-c454de00c682","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Therefore, we performed a global expression profiling of native and cultured human fetal and adult RPE and determined a set of highly expressed ‘signature’ genes by comparing the observed RPE gene profiles to the Novartis expression database (SymAtlas: http://wombat.gnf.org/index.html) of 78 tissues.

The clinical diagnosis was based on pre- senting symptoms, family history, fundus examination, and subsequently supported by clinical imaging, full-field electroretinography (ffERG), and/or genetic testing. Ophthalmic examinations included a slit-lamp and dilated funduscopic examination, best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), short-wavelength fundus autofluorescence (SW- AF, 488 nm excitation), and spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). The inclusion criteria for this study were the diagnosis of RP and genetic characterization of the disease, while the exclusion criteria precluded monocular patients or those without SD-OCT or SW-AF imaging","previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"not mentioned","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/06e99913-187d-40f2-9247-c797928ea022_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32098976","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c7ff7629-fe68-4a02-9b14-90a1e919f318"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"}}},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/06e99913-187d-40f2-9247-c797928ea022","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"- homozygous\n- unsure of genotyping method\n- large allele frequency","calculatedScore":3.0,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/06e99913-187d-40f2-9247-c797928ea022_variant_evidence_item"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":1.0}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria","strengthScore":1.0}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":8615,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria9","strengthScore":13.5,"subject":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/78JKufgzPoI","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0700232","gene":"hgnc:15865","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.1","websiteLegacyID":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/assertion_f0705bfe-f3fa-495f-8a5d-77561d0afe91-","@context":{"@vocab":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"},"curationReasons":{"@type":"@vocab","@container":"@set"},"GCISnapshot":{"@type":"@id"},"dc:isVersionOf":{"@type":"@id"},"websiteLegacyID":{"@type":"@id"}}}
