This classification was approved by the ClinGen Aminoacidopathy GCEP on June 29, 2020 (SOP Version 7). \n \nSupplementary remarks provided by the Prenatal GCEP:\nBiallelic variants in PHGDH lead to a disorder with phenotypic variability.  The severe presentation, classically defined as Neu-Laxova syndrome is characterized prenatally by severe fetal growth restriction, skeletal anomalies including contractures with or without pterygia, cataracts, dysmorphic features, collodion-like ichthyosis, variable MRI findings including lissencephaly, hydrocephalus, and cerebellar hypoplasia, microcephaly, and in severe cases, pre- or perinatal lethality.  Individuals with biallelic pathogenic variants in *PHGDH* and relevant prenatal phenotypes have been described in multiple publications with missense, nonsense, frameshift, and canonical splice variants described [PMID:24836451, 25913727, 26610677, 30838783, 31903955, 32579715].  Infantile onset *PHGDH* deficiency is characterized by neurodevelopmental delay, intellectual disability, spastic tetraparesis, microcephaly, variable MRI findings, epilepsy, and may also be associated with intrauterine growth restriction and congenital microcephaly [PMID:28440900]."],"dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ec13ca39-cecd-4659-8959-fcd8278e480b","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f1b4e8da-d6e7-4494-abb0-f2953548a722","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f1b4e8da-d6e7-4494-abb0-f2953548a722_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10011","date":"2025-07-07T13:40:03.253Z","role":"Publisher"},{"agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10106","role":"SecondaryContributor"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f1b4e8da-d6e7-4494-abb0-f2953548a722_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10011","date":"2020-06-29T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","curationReasons":["ErrorClarification"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f1b4e8da-d6e7-4494-abb0-f2953548a722_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f1b4e8da-d6e7-4494-abb0-f2953548a722_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/77d7ba69-8203-4790-bb18-da897a09755b","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The full-length rat 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase was expressed in E.coli and purified.
