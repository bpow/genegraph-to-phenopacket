More than 100 unique variants have been reported in the literature (PMID: 32135084). Approximately half of the variants observed in humans are missense, although nonsense, frameshift, splice site, and in-frame indel variants have also been reported. Eight variants were included in this curation to reach a classification of definitive, however more evidence is available in the literature (PMID: 26235985, 30349862, 30936465, 30734472). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 3 family members. More research is needed to determine whether disease is caused by haploinsufficiency or a dominant negative mechanism. This gene-disease association is supported by animal models, expression studies, and in vitro functional assays (PMID: 27179789, 27656019, 32135084). In summary, DDX3X is definitively associated with X-linked syndromic intellectual disability.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0154c14e-8bc5-470a-81ec-9eae7b5a6c28","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3b7c89d4-ccb2-4d4e-ad11-9d6051a40b6d","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3b7c89d4-ccb2-4d4e-ad11-9d6051a40b6d_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2020-05-05T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3b7c89d4-ccb2-4d4e-ad11-9d6051a40b6d_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3b7c89d4-ccb2-4d4e-ad11-9d6051a40b6d_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3b7c89d4-ccb2-4d4e-ad11-9d6051a40b6d_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/14850455-c7e4-45f7-92f7-c76226d08ebf","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Downgraded because the ID phenotype is not recapitulated and the model uses a full deletion instead of a missense, nonsense, frameshift, or indel variant observed in humans.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8de4c5fe-b1e0-4d59-b2c2-062939489095","type":"Finding","dc:description":"The maternally derived Ddx3x mutant allele resulted in fetal growth restriction and 100% lethality for both male and female mice.
