Defects of this protein lead to complex I deficiency.  \n\n*MT-ND1* was first reported in relation to primary mitochondrial disease in 1991 (PMID: 1928099). While various names have been given to the constellation of features seen in those with *MT-ND1*-related disease, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *MT-ND1* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework. Of note, *MT-ND1* was previously curated by this panel for its association with Leigh syndrome spectrum (LSS) on April 12, 2021 (SOP v8), with a final classification of definitive. This current curation for the association with primary mitochondrial disease includes cases with LSS.\n\nEvidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation includes eight variants (m.3460G>A, m.3481G>A, m.3688G>A, m.3697G>A, m.3890G>A, m.3902_3908delinsGCAAGGT, m.3928G>C, m.3946G>A)  in 13 probands from 12 publications (PMIDs: 1928099, 15466014, 10775530, 16492986, 18504678, 18977334, 23246842, 24063851, 27017994, 24830958, 31996177, 17535832). With the exception of one small inversion (m.3902_3908delinsGCAAGGT) all variants were missense. There were four recurrent variants (m.3697G>A, m.3890G>A, m.3635G>A, m.3902_3908delinsGCAAGGT). Cybrid studies further supported the pathogenicity of several variants (PMIDs: 1928099, 15466014, 16492986, 18977334, 23246842). Affected individuals present with a broad phenotypic spectrum of disease including Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON), mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS), LSS, and exercise intolerance phenotypes. The age of onset is also highly variable, ranging from infantile to adult. Muscle biopsies variably revealed focal subsarcolemmal accumulation of mitochondria, ragged red fibers, and isolated complex I deficiency. Metabolic screening labs showed elevated lactate and pyruvate in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood. Heteroplasmy levels in affected individuals ranged from 36% to homoplasmic in skeletal muscle, undetectable to homoplasmic in blood, 12% to homoplasmic in fibroblasts, 70% - 96% in urine, 87% - 95% in liver, and ranged from 85% - 93% in other tissues such as heart, hair follicles, and buccal sample; and ranged in healthy family members from undetectable to 3% in blood, undetectable to 3% in urine, 14% to 95% in hair follicles, 16% to 68% in buccal, and was undetectable in fibroblasts and muscle in healthy family members.\n\nLoss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease association is also supported by a known biochemical function shared with other genes associated with primary mitochondrial disease and functional alteration in cybrid cell lines and in an Escherichia coli model system (PMIDs: 27509854, 22079202, 17535832).    \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support this gene-disease relationship, including that more than three years have elapsed from the first proposal of the association. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on April 3, 2023 (SOP Version 9).

The d-NADH:DB oxidoreductase activity (at 100 μM DB) in membranes from the E36K mutant was almost totally abolished (Table 2) and could not be enhanced by increasing the DB concentration. The d-NADH:O2 activity, which utilizes endogenous UQ, was more severely affected than the d-NADH:UQ reductase activity with short-chained DB, presenting 4% and 13% of control activities, respectively. Also the d-NADH:HAR reductase activity was decreased, suggesting a decrease in the amount of fully assembled NDH-1 in cytoplasmic membranes (Fig 2). The I201V substitution, analogous to human p.I187V, had a small effect on the amount of NDH-1 in the membranes but the activity with DB was bot significantly decreased. 2.
