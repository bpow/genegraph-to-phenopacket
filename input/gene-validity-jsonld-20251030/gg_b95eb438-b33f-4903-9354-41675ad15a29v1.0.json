This protein is involved in the mitochondrial and lipid metabolism. C19orf12 was first reported in relation to Autosomal Recessive Neurodegeneration with Brain Iron Accumulation (NBIA) in 2011. (Hartig et al 2011, PMID:21981780). Hartig et al first described 25 NBIA cases with homozygous, or compound heterozygous frameshift, or missense variants in C19orf12. A total of 18 NBIA cases were found to have homozygous common founder mutation c.204_214del11 (p.Gly69ArgfsX10) with all individuals having common MRI brain findings of hypointensities in the globus pallidus and substantia nigra, and presenting features including speech, gait difficulties, extrapyramidal features (oromandibular dystonia, generalized dystonia and parkinsonism), spasticity, hyperreflexia, psychiatric symptoms, and optic atrophy. C19orf12 was previously reported in two Malian sisters presenting with spastic paraplegia with gait difficulty, spasticity and peripheral neuropathy without brain abnormalities. (Landoure et al 2013 (PMID: 23857908); Meilleur et al 2009 (PMID: 20039086)). Both disease assertions have overlapping features in the central and peripheral nervous systems, with NBIA individuals having additional MRI brain abnormal findings in globus pallidus/substantia nigra, and ophthalmological features (e.g. Optic atrophy).\nMonfrini et al first published a case report of a patient with NBIA with novel heterozygous pathogenic variant c.265_266delAT (p.Met89Glyfs*12) in C19orf12 (Monfrini et al 2018, PMID:29295770). This was followed by Gregory et al that published 18 heterozygous cases of C19orf12-related NBIA from 13 families (Gregory et al 2019, PMID:3108752). The individuals with autosomal dominant form of NBIA were clinically similar to individuals with autosomal recessive form of NBIA. Gregory et al proposed that the nonsense truncating variants located in the final exon of C19rf12 impairs the function of the wild-type protein, producing a dominant-negative effect and leading to loss of function (Gregory et al 2019, PMID:3108752). Another proposed dominant disease mechanism was haploinsufficiency (Gregory et al 2019, PMID: 3108752)\n \nEvidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level and experimental data. Heterozygous variants in C19orf12  (including nonsense and frameshift) were identified in at least 19 patients with clinical features suggestive of Autosomal Dominant Neurodegeneration with Brain Iron Accumulation (NBIA) (Gregory et al 2019, PMID: 3108752; Monfrini et al 2018, PMID:29295770; Rickman et al 2021, PMID:33260061; Fraser et al 2021, PMID:34041867; Yang et al 2022, PMID:35432442).\nAt least 13 unique variants (nonsense and frameshift) have been reported in humans and the information of six unique variants in C19orf12 is available in ClinVar database. This gene-disease association is supported by biochemical function studies, non-human model organism studies, and functional alteration analysis. (Hartig et al 2011, PMID:21981780; Landouré et al 2013, PMID: 23857908; Mori et al 2019, PMID 31548400; Mignani et al 2020, PMID: 33425903; Iuso et al 2014, PMID:24586779; Venco et al 2015, PMID: 26136767; Shao et al 2022, PMID: 35182730).\nIn summary, the C19orf12 gene has a moderate association with Autosomal Dominant Neurodegeneration with Brain Iron Accumulation (NBIA).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b95eb438-b33f-4903-9354-41675ad15a29","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c78e8a8a-49db-40f5-96a3-d126a3834976","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c78e8a8a-49db-40f5-96a3-d126a3834976_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10060","date":"2023-02-28T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c78e8a8a-49db-40f5-96a3-d126a3834976_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10060","date":"2024-03-25T20:05:34.139Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c78e8a8a-49db-40f5-96a3-d126a3834976_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c78e8a8a-49db-40f5-96a3-d126a3834976_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fd2f00b8-7bd2-4489-92a1-beffe0d7a7e5","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f5f43d54-523f-4bf6-873a-90c71a767d1f","type":"Finding","dc:description":"The authors have demonstrated that with knock down of gene a (ortholog) in zebrafish embryo, the large majority of them (171/206, 83.0%) showed perturbed brain morphology with smaller brain size and eyes, reduced yolk extension along with a curved and thinner tail, and defected somite development (mild category). A small number of embryos (15/206, 7.3%) were characterized by a dramatic alteration of the structure, with severe perturbation of the antero-posterior axis, cardiac edema and compromised somite development (evere category) and the remaining embryos (20/206) showed a normal phenotype. Besides that, the authors have also analysed neuronal development, musculature development and locomotor behaviours of the the zebrafish with mild phenotype using different methods. i) Using transgenic lines expressing EGFP under neurogenin1 (neurog1) or neuronal differentiation 1 (neurod1) promoters, there is suggestion that there were reduced signals in the midbrain-hindbrain boundary, particularly at the level of optic tectum and retina. The analysis of the transgenic lines suggests that downregulation of gene a may affect the early stages of development in neurons in trunk, or cells located in retina, tectum opticum and the midbrain-hindbrain boundary. ii) The ATG-morphants showed an overall reduction in birefringence pattern (bright birefringence indicative of highly organized skeletal muscle) that was suggestive of a disorganized skeletal muscle structure. iii) Objective motor function measurement was obtained through calculation of spontaenous tail coil movement at 24 hpf, touch-evoked swimming movement test at 48 hpf, and the downregulation of gene a expression is associated with significant loss of motor performance of embryos in injected embryo compared to control embryo.

Mitochondrial function was determined by seahorse assay which revealed impaired mitochondrial respiration activity in C19orf12 KO M17 cells as evidenced by significantly reduced maximal oxygen consumption rate (OCR) (Fig. 1D and E). It was noted that non-mitochondrial respiration was increased in C19orf12 KO M17 cells (Fig. 1G). Collectively, these data demonstrated that loss of C19orf12 caused mitochondrial deficits in neurons. MPAN is characterized by massive iron accumulation in cerebral tissues [4]. We hypothesized that loss of C19orf12 protein might affect cellular iron pool to disturb cellular homeostasis. To test this hypothesis, the labile iron pool was analyzed with two specific cellular iron probes BioTracker 575 and Calcein-AM. Live cell imaging revealed that BioTracker 575 fluorescence was increased while Calcein-AM was quenched following chelation of low-mass labile iron, suggesting both cytosolic ferrous and ferric iron pools were increased in C19orf12 KO cells (Fig. 2A and B). Consistent with increased iron levels in the cytosol but not in mitochondria, there were significantly increased ROS levels in the cytosol but no changes of ROS levels in the mitochondria in C19orf12 KO cells. Accompanying the increased cytosolic ROS, lipid peroxidation levels measured by BODIPY C11 for probe by live cell imaging showed significant increase of oxidized membrane lipids in C19orf12 KO cells (Fig. 2E), suggesting impaired membrane integrity of cellular organelles in cells with loss of C19orf12 proteins.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35182730","rdfs:label":"KO cells-mitochondrial dysfn, lipid peroxidation, iron accum","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCellCultureModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8a44622c-e04e-41db-9465-75e6c06a336e","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The phenotype abnormality seen in Zebrafish using a translation-inhibiting morpholino (ATG-MO) that is complementary to the -17/+5 region of gene a mRNA affects brain formulation and somite development - not completely translatable to human disease manifestation of NBIA.

About 43% (n D 132/305) of the co-injected embryos still showed a mild phenotype, but less than 2% (n D 6/305) a severe one (Figure 3C).
