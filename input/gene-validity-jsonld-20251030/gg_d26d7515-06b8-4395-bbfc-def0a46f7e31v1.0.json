Since then, seven variants in 15 families with CND have been reported in four studies. The phenotypes of patients with KCNC1-related CND vary from developmental delay/intellectual disability and hypotonia without seizures to seizures, global developmental delay, hypotonia, and ataxia. The onset varies from birth to 3 years of age. There is a recurrent variant, p.Ala421Val, which is associated with severe phenotypes with myoclonic and generalized tonic clonic seizures and intellectual disability. In addition to CND, KCNC1 is also associated with autosomal dominant progressive myoclonus epilepsy, which is curated separately. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss of function and dominant negative. Of the 15 reported probands, two had loss-of-function variants inherited from a parent and each received 1.5 pts. Of the remaining 13 families, 12 had de novo variants and received 0.5pt. Of these 12 families de novo variants, 11 had variants with their effects verified by functional studies and received additional 0.5 pts each. In total, maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts) has been reached. In summary, KCNC1 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant complex neurodevelopmental disorder. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time.\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d26d7515-06b8-4395-bbfc-def0a46f7e31","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5146494e-71e7-4e06-b10f-cc126429e3fb","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5146494e-71e7-4e06-b10f-cc126429e3fb_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10005","date":"2022-11-07T20:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5146494e-71e7-4e06-b10f-cc126429e3fb_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10005","date":"2022-11-08T06:13:17.506Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5146494e-71e7-4e06-b10f-cc126429e3fb_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6cb127fd-5ab6-4dbd-ad9d-5fc9b2abd78a","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The functional test is redundant since the variant is expected to cause nonsense mediated decay of RNA","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6cb127fd-5ab6-4dbd-ad9d-5fc9b2abd78a_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"Patch-clamp recording on Xenopus oocytes injected with the variant RNA showed  reduced current.

Briefly, libraries were prepared from 3 μg genomic DNA extracted from whole blood using an optimized SureSelect Human Exome kit (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) following the manufacturer's instructions. Captured, purified, and clonally amplified libraries targeting the exome were then sequenced on a HiSeq 2000 (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Obtained sequence reads were aligned to the human genome (hg19) using BWA software. Downstream processing was carried out with Genome analysis toolkit (GATK), SAMtools, and Picard Tools (http://picard.sourceforge.net/).14, 15 Single-nucleotide variants and indels were subsequently called by SAMtools suite (mpileup, bcftools, vcfutil). All calls with a read coverage ≤5 × and a Phred-scaled SNP quality of ≤20 were filtered out. Substitution and variation calls were performed with SAMtools pipeline (mpileup). The variants were annotated with an in-house Paris Descartes bioinformatics platform pipeline based on the Ensembl database (release 67).16 An autosomal dominant approach was applied for candidate gene identification. After exome analysis, each selected variants were confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using genomic DNA from the patients and their parents and direct sequencing using BigDyedideoxy terminator chemistry and an ABI3130xl genetic DNA analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).","ethnicity":{"id":"cg:UnknownEthnicity"},"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"The affected girl was born at term after an uneventful pregnancy and delivery.

To determine potential dominant‐negative effect, we performed coexpression experiments, where both WT and mutant cRNA of the same concentration were injected at a 1:1 ratio. Two variants that showed very small or no currents, (Arg317His and Arg339X) caused a significant reduction compared to the WT current amplitude indicating a dominant‐negative effect (Fig. ​(Fig.3A3A and ​and3).3). For the coexpression of the Gln492X with the WT, the normalized current amplitudes were as follows: WT + H20 – 1.00 ± 0.03 (n = 111) and WT + Gln492X – 1.02 ± 0.12 (n = 21). In both cases, the injected amount of WT cRNA was the same, so that the resulting current amplitude of the coexpression should be the sum of the expressed WT + H2O (1.00 ± 0.03) and half of the amplitude recorded for the Gln492X alone (0.7 ± 0.1; Fig. ​Fig.2C),2C), that is, with a value of about 1.3. Since this predicted value is larger than the recorded one this might suggest the dominant‐negative effect of the Gln492X.  The conductance‐voltage relationships for Ala421Val + WT, Arg317His + WT, Gln492X + WT, and Arg339X + WT did not differ from the wild type alone. With no changes seen in the voltage dependence of activation, the observed reduction in current amplitudes may be explained by other mechanisms such as reduced number of mutant channels reaching the membrane or reduced open probability of these channels.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31353855","rdfs:label":"Current analysis"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5146494e-71e7-4e06-b10f-cc126429e3fb_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5637de95-841c-46af-8c15-a298c85f840b","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"In the Epilepsy GCEP meeting, we decided that we do not need this evidence.","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Inconclusive","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5201f3f7-49bf-482c-8edc-e8165feb1f1a","type":"Finding","dc:description":"This result shows that KCNC1 plays a role in maintaining high frequency firing of neurons by rapid repolarization.

As previously reported in rat (Sekirnjak et al. 1997; Weiser et al. 1995) Kv3.1b immunoreactivity was most prominent in the cerebellar cortex. Other regions with strong labeling for Kv3.1b were the hippocampus, the reticular thalamic nucleus, the neocortex and several structures in the brain stem. Consistent with observations on the distribution of splice version-specific mRNA transcripts (Perney et al. 1992), Kv3.1a immunostaining was seen in similar areas, although signals were weaker for this isoform, particularly in the brain stem. On the other hand, there were a few structures, most notably the olfactory bulb, where Kv3.1a immunoreactivity was stronger. In fact, while the olfactory bulb was one of the areas showing highest levels of Kv3.1a protein, this structure expressed Kv3.1b weakly.   \n\n Kv3.1b  proteins  were prominently  expressed  in  the  somatic  and  proximal  dendritic  membrane of specific neuronal populations in the mouse brain. The axons of most of these neurons also expressed Kv3.1b protein. In contrast,Kv3.1a proteins were prominently expressed in the axons of some of the  same  neuronal  populations,  but  there  was  little  to  no  Kv3.1a protein expression in somatodendritic membrane. Exceptions to this pattern were seen in two neuronal populations with unusual targeting of  axonal  proteins,  mitral  cells  of  the  olfactory  bulb,  and  mesencephalic  trigeminal  neurons,  which  expressed  Kv3.1a  protein  in  dendritic  and  somatic  membrane,  respectively.
