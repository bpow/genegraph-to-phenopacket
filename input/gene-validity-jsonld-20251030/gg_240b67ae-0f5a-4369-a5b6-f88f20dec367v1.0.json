{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/240b67ae-0f5a-4369-a5b6-f88f20dec367v1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"The relationship between *MRPL39* and primary mitochondrial disease was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of January 29, 2024. The *MRPL39* gene encodes the mitochondrial ribosomal protein L39, one of 52 mitochondrial large ribosomal protein subunits that form the mitochondrial ribosome. \n\n*MRPL39* was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive primary mitochondrial disease in 2023 (PMID:18771761), in three affected individuals presenting with a broad phenotype spectrum of severe disease including Leigh syndrome spectrum (LSS). Clinical features included developmental delay, hypotonia, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, feeding difficulty and faltering growth, together with brain abnormalities detected by MRI and elevate blood lactate. The age of onset ranged from birth to early infancy and cases showed variability in the severity of the clinical course.  While various names have been given to the constellation of features seen in those with *MRPL39*-related disease, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *MRPL39* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework.\n\nEvidence supporting the gene-disease relationship between *MRPL39* and primary mitochondrial disease includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation includes four unique variants in three probands from one publication (PMID: 18771761). Variant types included one missense, one frameshift, and two splice region variants. Loss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. \n\nThis gene-disease association is also supported by known biochemical function and functional alteration observed in fibroblasts from affected individuals (PMIDs: 33340416; 18771761).\n\nIn summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on January 29, 2024 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/240b67ae-0f5a-4369-a5b6-f88f20dec367","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9b112a15-0b02-4942-bd93-7cac3305f3b9","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9b112a15-0b02-4942-bd93-7cac3305f3b9_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2024-03-29T00:24:29.230Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9b112a15-0b02-4942-bd93-7cac3305f3b9_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2024-01-29T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9b112a15-0b02-4942-bd93-7cac3305f3b9_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9b112a15-0b02-4942-bd93-7cac3305f3b9_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5d6321fd-2b78-4fa0-84f0-b667623b6d1a","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2432b391-e9bd-4cad-aaeb-9ec636d25165","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Fibroblast cell line derived from three affected patients showed reduced levels of MRPL39 protein as well as reduced levels of other MRP large proteins, suggesting instability of the large mitochondrial ribosomal subunit (Fig 4B) .​\n\nOverexpression of MRPL39 through lentiviral transduction of a MRPL39 cDNA construct restored levels of the MRPL proteins (Fig 4C-D).
