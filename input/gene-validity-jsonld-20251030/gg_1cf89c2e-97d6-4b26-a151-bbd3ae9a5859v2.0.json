Evidence supporting this gene-disease curation includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data. A tandem 77.9kb duplication on chromosome 10 that encompasses the PLAU gene is the only variant associated with QPD.  Quebec Platelet disorder was originally found in two co-probands from a large family from the Canadian province of Quebec and has since been described in at least 3 dozen additional people who also have the tandem duplication. In 2004, it was determined that the original co-probands and additional 3 dozen people are all members of a single family (McKay et al, PMID: 15026313) limiting the genetic evidence that could be used in this curation. The gene-disease relationship is supported by its altered expression in platelets (PMID: 11435291) and the functional alteration observed in patient cells (PMID: 19029443).  Further support is provided in a mouse model in which the human phenotype is partially recapitulated (PMID: 12689937).\nIn summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence, specifically more probands, are needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. Although this curation has less than 3 probands, the Hemostasis and Thrombosis GCEP upgraded the gene-disease curation to moderate due to the very large pedigree with more than 3 dozen affected family members. \n \nThis gene-disease classification was originally approved by the ClinGen Hemostasis and Thrombosis Gene Curation Expert Panel on January 5, 2022 and re-evaluated on February 5, 2024. No new genetic or experimental evidence emerged subsequent to the original curation date, and as a result, the classification did not change.\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1cf89c2e-97d6-4b26-a151-bbd3ae9a5859","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6ffd0133-1004-4a53-b38d-940c257e56c1","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","changes":[{"id":"cg:sopChange"},{"id":"cg:summaryChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6ffd0133-1004-4a53-b38d-940c257e56c1_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2024-02-05T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6ffd0133-1004-4a53-b38d-940c257e56c1_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2024-05-01T16:33:43.039Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["RecurationTiming"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6ffd0133-1004-4a53-b38d-940c257e56c1_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6ffd0133-1004-4a53-b38d-940c257e56c1_seg_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4028d323-45bf-4937-a9a5-637e7dae5fd5_proband_segregation","type":"FamilyCosegregation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18988861","rdfs:label":"QPS- Diamandis","family":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4028d323-45bf-4937-a9a5-637e7dae5fd5","type":"Family","rdfs:label":"QPS- Diamandis"},"meetsInclusionCriteria":true,"phenotypePositiveAllelePositive":28,"phenotypes":["obo:HP_0000421","obo:HP_0001934","obo:HP_0000978","obo:HP_0005261","obo:HP_0040232"],"proband":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e974cc21-fd5f-4f7f-81f0-7440a6701636"},"publishedLodScore":8.4,"sequencingMethod":{"id":"cg:CandidateGeneSequencing"}},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0a3cfba1-f4f3-4fdb-b141-187fe60820ac_proband_segregation","type":"FamilyCosegregation","dc:description":"LOD score cannot be used due to limited QPD patients studied in this paper.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20007542","rdfs:label":"QPS - Paterson","family":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0a3cfba1-f4f3-4fdb-b141-187fe60820ac","type":"Family","rdfs:label":"QPS - Paterson","member":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/233ccc35-1ff7-4182-a042-c4c2e5ac2783","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20007542","rdfs:label":"QPD 1&2 - Paterson","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/04e06b76-67ed-40c2-8c74-9b1949ad1798","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NC_000010.9:g.75329022_75406959dup","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/29921"}},"detectionMethod":"Using microarray technology, 1M SNV and copy number variation (CNV) was analyzed.
