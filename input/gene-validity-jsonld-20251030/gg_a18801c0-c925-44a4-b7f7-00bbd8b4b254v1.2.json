At least 8 unique variants (nonsense, frameshift, splice-site) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 7 probands in 3 publications (PMIDs: 28017374, 28220527, 31133047). The mechanism for disease is homozygous loss of function. This gene-disease association is supported by animal models and expression studies. In summary, MYPN is definitively associated with autosomal recessive MYPN-related myopathy.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a18801c0-c925-44a4-b7f7-00bbd8b4b254","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6aeb67cc-c960-4511-a708-b0acadb34588","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6aeb67cc-c960-4511-a708-b0acadb34588_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10031","date":"2020-11-16T14:38:07.637Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6aeb67cc-c960-4511-a708-b0acadb34588_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10031","date":"2020-06-17T19:46:36.472Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6aeb67cc-c960-4511-a708-b0acadb34588_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ee89f48c-37ab-4e3a-84b4-928a05120a49_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Individual is from a consanguineous family.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/162c8eae-3f81-4d70-a744-c413aad32d5d","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31133047","rdfs:label":"Merlini Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":35,"detectionMethod":"We performed whole-exome sequencing on both affected sibling and consanguineous healthy parents.
