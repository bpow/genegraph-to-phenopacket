PU.1 is a key transcriptional regulator required in the development of multiple hematopoietic lineages. The phenotype associated with agammaglobulinemia 10 due to *SPI1* variants is characterized by early childhood onset of recurrent viral and bacterial infections affecting various organ systems, sinopulmonary infections with encapsulated bacteria, absent or low B cells and hypo or agammaglobulinemia. (Le Coz et al, 2021; PMID: 33951726). SPI1 was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant agammaglobulinemia in 2021 (Le Coz et al, 2021; PMID: 33951726). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. \nSummary of Case Level Data (10.5 points): There have been 8 unrelated patients from 3 publication with germline, heterozygous variants in *SPI1* (PMIDs: 33951726, 38500873, 39052144). The 7 variants reported included 2 frameshift variants, 3 nonsense variants and 2 missense variants. Segregation analysis performed on 4 of the individuals revealed that the variant was de novo in all 4 of these probands (PMID: 33951726). The mechanism of disease is expected to be haploinsufficiency. Functional studies in patient cells and in-vitro cultures of mutant-transfected cells suggest that the variant impacts include the decay mRNA transcripts, destabilization of the PU.1 protein, interferance with PU.1 nuclear localization and / or alteratrion of PU.1 ETS domain-DNA binding. (PMID: 33951726)\nSummary of experimental data (3 points): This gene-disease relationship is supported by its biochemical function (PMID: 15469848) and expression in B cells (PMID: 2180582), as well as both cell culture and mouse model evidence. Adoptive transfer of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) from a patient’s unaffected sibling normalised PU.1 expression and resolved B cell and cDC deficiencies (PMID: 33951726). A cell culture model using CRISPR/Cas9 to edit the SPI1 locus in human HSPCs showed that myeloid and B cells were not tolerant to frameshift edits (PMID: 33951726). Germline homozygous *SPI1* knock-out mice were embryonically lethal with testing of embryos showing elimination of B lineage progenitors (PMID: 8079170). Conditionally knocked out mice were found to partially recapitulate the cellular phenotype seen in humans demonstrating a deficiency of cDC cells (PMID: 30611612).\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *SPI1* and autosomal dominant Agammaglobulinemia 10. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.\n\nThis gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the Antibody Deficiencies GCEP on August, 16 2022. It was reevaluated on December 12, 2024. As a result of this reevaluation, the classification changed from Strong to Definitive due to the replication of this gene-disease relationship over time and two additional case reports (PMIDs: 38500873, 39052144).\n","The relationship between *SPI1* and Agammaglobulinemia 10, an autosomal dominant disorder, was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework. *SPI1* encodes an ETS-domain transcription factor (PU.1).
