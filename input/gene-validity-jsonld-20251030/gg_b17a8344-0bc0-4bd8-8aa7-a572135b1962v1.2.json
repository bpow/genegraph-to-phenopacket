Six variants, including truncating variants and missense variants resulting in loss of function, have been reported in seven unrelated families (PMIDs: 11889465, 12525535, 21584729, 26350204, 31981491, DECIPHER). Four families have multiple affected males (PMIDs: 11889465, 12525535, 21584729). Males have intellectual disability of variable severity and language impairments, without facial dysmorphism; some have autism spectrum disorder or autistic behavior. Carrier females with sequence variants or genomic deletions in *ACSL4* show a completely skewed X-inactivation and highly variable cognitive capacities, ranging from moderate or borderline ID to normal intelligence. The mechanism of pathogenicity is loss of function.\n\n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence, including a drosophila model. *ACSL4* encodes long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase 4, an enzyme involved in fatty acid metabolism. Analysis of *ACSL4* enzymatic activity in lymphoblastoid cell lines or blood shows a marked reduction in affected individuals (PMIDs: 11889465, 12525535).\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *ACSL4* and non-syndromic X-linked intellectual disability. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel on January 10, 2023 (SOP Version 9). This gene-disease relationship was originally evaluated on October 20, 2017 and given a Moderate classification. Curation of additional genetic evidence resulted in the classification being updated.\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b17a8344-0bc0-4bd8-8aa7-a572135b1962","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b4da722c-f7fc-4dc4-ad19-1d1b023d488f","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b4da722c-f7fc-4dc4-ad19-1d1b023d488f_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2023-01-10T19:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b4da722c-f7fc-4dc4-ad19-1d1b023d488f_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2023-02-08T20:22:48.375Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b4da722c-f7fc-4dc4-ad19-1d1b023d488f_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/60b3e0a9-92d7-4490-ad3a-cf938b3dbd42","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Maternally inherited.\n","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/60b3e0a9-92d7-4490-ad3a-cf938b3dbd42_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19344873","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6081454d-31ac-404d-bcf2-443c06eed301","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001318510.2(ACSL4):c.1181dup (p.Asn394LysfsTer?)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA2573332862"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Hemizygous"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0c34a622-e558-45a5-987c-0d10b32c1883","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"This missense variant is recurrent, reported previously by Longo et al.
