{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a50f2232-856e-4fa4-b023-22ab5649e974v2.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"*TTN*: Arrythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy\nMode of Inheritance: Autosomal dominant inheritance (HP:0000006)\nHGNC:12403\t MONDO:0016587 \nExpert Panel: Arrythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy\n\nNine papers were reviewed related to *TTN* and ARVD (23297410, 23299917, 25157032, 29750433, 24055113, 24082139, 25445213, 29221435, 21810661). In a paper the authors found in 11 of 35 ARVD patients missense variants in *TTN*. After evaluation of the family members they conclude that *TTN* missense variants had either a very low penetrance or negligible pathogenicity on the disease (29750433). Gonzalez-Garay et al found a missense variant in an ARVD patient that was also found 19 times in gnomAD (25157032). Only in two papers from the same group potentially relevant information was found. 38 ARVD families were analyzed  for the *TTN* gene because previously analyzed ARVD linked genes (DSC2, DSG2, DSP, and PKP2) were negative. Eight unique *TTN* nonsynonymous variants were identified in seven unrelated ARVC probands with one proband that was a compound heterozygote having two *TTN* variants. This is not strange to find because the gene is huge and in reference alleles in gnomAD missense variants are very common. Five of these variants occur relatively often in gnomAD (between 18 and 1134 times) making them less likely as a disease causing variant. One of these variants could be of interest. The variant NM_133378.4 (TTN): c.8687C>T; p.T2896I showed co-segregation (published lod score of 2.41) in 9 (probably) affected with the genotype of whom six of them had ARVD (21810661, 25157032). The variant, present in an Ig10 domain, was further tested in an in vitro functional assay by two independent groups (21810661, 23297410). Both found that the variant introduced an aberrant function. Unfortunately only a very small part of the protein was tested and the TTN protein contains many of these domains therefore making it difficult to judge if the variant will alter the mutant protein in the patient. Total awarded points = 1.00; Final classification = limited.\n\nThis gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy GCEP on August 6, 2019. It was re-evaluated on October 15, 2025 by the Hereditary Cardiovascular GCEP. As a result of this reevaluation, the classification was changed from Limited to Disputed given the lack of evidence in the originally curated cases and the lack of any new cases since the original curation that have convincing evidence of isolated arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy due to monogenic variation in *TTN*. \n\n\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a50f2232-856e-4fa4-b023-22ab5649e974","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a93ab74d-c9fa-4e74-b849-c8c6e8366050","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"NoKnownDiseaseRelationship","changes":[{"id":"cg:expertPanelChange"},{"id":"cg:classificationChange"},{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"},{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},{"id":"cg:sopChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a93ab74d-c9fa-4e74-b849-c8c6e8366050_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10104","date":"2025-10-28T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a93ab74d-c9fa-4e74-b849-c8c6e8366050_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10104","date":"2025-10-30T16:03:37.422Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"No cases with variants that are sufficiently rare (<0.0001), in the I-band, or with functional evidence of variant impact were reported in the original curation or since (variants originally reported in 2011 with original ARVC GCEP curation in 2019).
