CSGALNACT1 is a highly conserved gene mapped to chromosome 8p21. It encodes chondroitin sulfate N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 1 (CSGalNAct-1) and plays a major role in the chondroitin sulfate chain biosynthesis and therefore in the synthesis of glycosaminoglycans. Persons with this condition typically present with mild skeletal dysplasia, advanced bone age, non-proportional short stature, hyperlordosis, pes planus, and joint laxity (PMIDs: 27599773, PMID:31325655, 31705726). Six variants (including missense, frameshift, and intragenic deletions) reported in 4 probands in 3 publications are included in this curation [PMIDs: 27599773, 31325655, 31705726]. The mechanism of pathogenicity is known to be loss of function. This gene-disease relationship is supported by functional evidence, including significantly reduced CSGalNAct-1 activity in vitro (PMIDs: 27599773, 31705726). Further evidence comes from the observed skeletal dysplasia reminiscent of CSGALNACT1-/- mice (Watanabe et al., PMIDs:20812917, 31705726). The most recent report suggests the term CSGALNACT1-CDG (PMID: 31705726). In summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation GCEP on the meeting date June 5, 2025 (SOP Version 11).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2ce98345-8a35-4709-b798-07e7dfce9698","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1ba7e544-2e7d-4314-b011-74210faae113","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1ba7e544-2e7d-4314-b011-74210faae113_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10135","date":"2025-06-25T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1ba7e544-2e7d-4314-b011-74210faae113_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10135","date":"2025-06-25T15:52:32.559Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1ba7e544-2e7d-4314-b011-74210faae113_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0612a069-2b66-484c-9fa6-d5672c08f38e_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2165bc9d-590b-424d-89ab-8fa3c777ad28","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2165bc9d-590b-424d-89ab-8fa3c777ad28_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"In COS7 cells, expression of the P384R mutant was considerably lower than the wildtype enzyme.

The presence of the WT CSGalNAcT‐1, but not the mutant enzymes, was detected in the conditioned medium by immunoblotting (Figure S3). In contrast, the protein expression levels in the cell fraction were comparable between the WT and the mutant enzymes (Figures 3e and S3).\n\nGalNAc‐transferase activities of p.Asp432Tyr‐CSGalNAcT‐1 and of p.Asn264Ser‐CSGalNAcT‐1 from the cell lysates toward chondroitin (Figure 3e) and toward pNP‐GlcUA (Figure S3) were significantly decreased compared to WT‐CSGalNAcT‐1 (p < .0001 and p < .0005, respectively). These data indicate that both CSGALNACT1 variants lead to a loss of enzyme function. \n","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31705726","rdfs:label":"CsGalNAcT-1 functional evidence","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionB"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":3}],"evidenceStrength":"Moderate","sequence":10677,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria11","strengthScore":11,"subject":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/AnCc6bWnEu8","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0030029","gene":"hgnc:24290","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","websiteLegacyID":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/assertion_1ba7e544-2e7d-4314-b011-74210faae113-","@context":{"@vocab":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"},"curationReasons":{"@type":"@vocab","@container":"@set"},"GCISnapshot":{"@type":"@id"},"dc:isVersionOf":{"@type":"@id"},"websiteLegacyID":{"@type":"@id"}}}
