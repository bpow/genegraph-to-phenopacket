At least 5 variants (nonsense and frameshift) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data.  Summary of case-level and experimental data: 9.5 points. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 5 probands in 4 publications (PMIDs: 22499341, 30581454, 26783368, 32181496). This gene disease relationship is supported by in vitro functional assays (PMID: 18353969, 22499341, 28108524, 32224193). In summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged. This gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the Peroxisomal Disorders GCEP on April 15, 2022. It was reevaluated on May 2, 2024. As a result of this reevaluation, the classification did not change.
