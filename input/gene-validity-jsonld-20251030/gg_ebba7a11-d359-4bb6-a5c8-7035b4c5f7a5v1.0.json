IMDDHH is a multisystem disorder characterized by immunodeficiency, mildly delayed psychomotor development, poor overall growth from infancy, and hypohomocysteinemia. Patients may also present with additional features such as congenital heart defects, potential liver damage, subcortical T2-weighted white matter abnormalities and other more variable phenotypes. At least 4 variants (all missense) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data.\n\nIn summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ebba7a11-d359-4bb6-a5c8-7035b4c5f7a5","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1472f697-3de2-466b-9e76-beea2ec6ddc3","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1472f697-3de2-466b-9e76-beea2ec6ddc3_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10081","date":"2025-08-17T22:14:06.665Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1472f697-3de2-466b-9e76-beea2ec6ddc3_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10081","date":"2025-08-17T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1472f697-3de2-466b-9e76-beea2ec6ddc3_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1472f697-3de2-466b-9e76-beea2ec6ddc3_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9a49bb20-8b46-4c9e-8737-8b64ac8e5c08","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Interaction requires both Nrf2 and Keap1 domains.

As these phenotypes have not been observed in mice with systemic double deficiency of Keap1 and Nrf2 genes, we surmise that the poorer survival and growth retardation are caused by Nrf2 activation in tissues other than the squamous epithelium.\n\nIn addition to the renal phenotypes, we found mild anaemia, growth retardation and poor survival in NEKO mice. Anaemia, growth retardation and poor survival are not recapitulated in renal tubular-specific Keap1-deficient mice (Keap1-TKO), indicating that these phenotypes are independent of Nrf2 activation in the renal tubules. The growth retardation of NEKO mice may be due to Nrf2 activation in the skeletal muscle and adipose tissues, as Keap1 deletion in the skeletal muscle reduces body weight, and loss of Keap1 represses differentiation of adipose cells. As NEKO mice likely have other phenotypes that have not yet been studied, further analysis of NEKO mice will provide new insights to understand the physiological function of Nrf2.\n\n---\n\nHistology results observed a mildly damaged glomeruli and infiltration of inflammatory cells in NEKO mouse kidney. \n\nMurine phenotypes of loss-of-Keap1-mediated Nrf2 hyperactivation, such as oesophageal hyperkeratosis and a urinary concentrating defect, suggests that Nrf2 regulates not only cytoprotective genes such as antioxidant and detoxifying genes, but also other genes involved in cell fate and function for organismal homeostasis.\n\nOur study indicates that a development stage-specific Nrf2 target gene is responsible for the renal phenotype, this suggests that the general induction of antioxidant genes by Nrf2 is unlikely to be responsible for the polyuria phenotype.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28233855","rdfs:label":"Observed IMDDHH phenotypes in NEKO","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1472f697-3de2-466b-9e76-beea2ec6ddc3_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3f8d14d3-ce03-47cd-ae85-be64aa2ce377","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3f8d14d3-ce03-47cd-ae85-be64aa2ce377_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29018201","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/84c92c14-6360-49e0-a569-6f64ee94f91a","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_006164.5(NFE2L2):c.91G>A (p.Gly31Arg)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA349381821"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:DeNovoAlleleOrigin"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"No","zygosity":{"id":"cg:Heterozygous"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bf0f9120-0b0b-4a26-8a73-3f2ff72fcb05","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bf0f9120-0b0b-4a26-8a73-3f2ff72fcb05_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"Western blot analysis -
