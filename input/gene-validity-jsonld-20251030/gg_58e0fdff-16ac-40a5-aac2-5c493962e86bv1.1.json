{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/58e0fdff-16ac-40a5-aac2-5c493962e86bv1.1","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"Pierre Robin Sequence (PRS), a collection of clinical features consisting of mandibular hypoplasia, cleft secondary palate, and glossoptosis leading to obstructive apnea and feeding difficulties, was first described in 1923 by P. Robin. (PMIDs: 8171154, 23799581). PRS can present in isolation as well as in association with various conditions such as Stickler syndrome.  Evidence supporting the SOX9-Pierre Robin Sequence gene disease relationship includes segregation data and experimental evidence including a mouse model. Deletions in the non-coding region of SOX9 have been identified in patients with PRS (PMIDs: 19234473, 23532965, 24934569). These variants have been found to cause reduced expression of SOX9 and KCNJ2 (PMIDs: 19234473, 17551083). In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the Skeletal Disorders Gene Curation Expert Panel on 8/3/2020.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/58e0fdff-16ac-40a5-aac2-5c493962e86b","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/951f7fcd-2b6a-46cd-be1d-7993ee5119c1","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","changes":{"id":"cg:sopChange"},"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/951f7fcd-2b6a-46cd-be1d-7993ee5119c1_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10065","date":"2024-08-06T18:00:16.176Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/951f7fcd-2b6a-46cd-be1d-7993ee5119c1_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10065","date":"2024-08-06T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["ErrorClarification"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/951f7fcd-2b6a-46cd-be1d-7993ee5119c1_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/951f7fcd-2b6a-46cd-be1d-7993ee5119c1_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1bf134d2-c6ce-4a7e-98e2-26f1c65c8ea4","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8ec70134-1c20-48de-bc93-36903394ca14","type":"Finding","dc:description":"In embryonic day (E) 12.5 limb buds, Sox9 is expressed in the cartilage anlagen of the developing limbs","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31358994","rdfs:label":"Functional dissection of the Sox9–Kcnj2 locus","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0f089494-7d41-4c2f-b8be-0d04314f448b","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b930b57a-7809-4ec1-814a-9a22eaaa7b27","type":"Finding","dc:description":"A transient transgenic assay using the wild-type HCNE-F2* showed strong activity in the craniofacial region in mouse embryos at 11.5 days post coitum.\n\n*F2: missense variant identified in the PRS-affected family that falls within the F1** deletion\n**F1: deletion between locus markers D17S795 and D17S929 identified in a family with 12 PRS affected members.
