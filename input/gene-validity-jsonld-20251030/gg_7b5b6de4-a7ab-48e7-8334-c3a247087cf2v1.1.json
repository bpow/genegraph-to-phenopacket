The disorder is typically characterized by later (adolescence to adulthood) neurologic deterioration, loss of skills, and progressive impairment. Many individuals were described as presenting in childhood with epilepsy and neurodevelopmental impairment or intellectual disability. The childhood presentation led to the inclusion of this gene on epilepsy panels with resulting earlier identification, broadened phenotypes, and reports of patients at younger ages. The expert panel decided to curate this gene for the X-linked complex neurodevelopmental disorder phenotype which represents a spectrum of neurologic presentations that can include epilepsy, autism, movement disorders, and intellectual disability. It should be noted that a review of the literature identified 34 adolescent and adult cases and 17 pediatric cases. Given the earlier identification, increased reporting, and variable phenotypes, the ultimate course and variability of this disorder may not yet be determined.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7b5b6de4-a7ab-48e7-8334-c3a247087cf2","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/85a54036-4d36-414d-8d26-944b9763a039","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":[{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},{"id":"cg:sopChange"},{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/85a54036-4d36-414d-8d26-944b9763a039_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10005","date":"2019-06-28T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/85a54036-4d36-414d-8d26-944b9763a039_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10005","date":"2021-12-08T14:45:54.568Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/85a54036-4d36-414d-8d26-944b9763a039_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/85a54036-4d36-414d-8d26-944b9763a039_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4ccda85d-d7ab-4010-8881-1602c167a63d","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/81522bb8-fa5e-4e5b-bdf7-8faab072ac19","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Blockage of lysosomal degradation by the lysosomal inhibitor chloroquine resulted in a higher amount of LC3-II (the membrane bound form) in the cells transfected with the mutants compared to the control cells, suggesting that the autophagic flux was blocked.\nFurthermore, HeLa cells transfected with the WDR45R134P and WDR45G168E mutants exhibited obvious cell swelling.
