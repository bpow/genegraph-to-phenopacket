Clinical features of this disorder include scoliosis, joint pain, and malformations of the hands, feet, and knees (GeneReviews, Bonafé et al., 2014). However, radiographic analysis and histopathology are also important in arriving at a diagnosis. At least 11 unique variants (including missense, splice site, and frameshift variants) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 9 probands in 8 publications (PMID: 10465113, 12525546, 20592910, 20525296, 24598000, 21922596, 21077204, 23613459). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 3 additional family members. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence has been reached. Of note, variants in this gene have also been shown to cause diastrophic dysplasia, atelosteogenesis type 2, and achondrogenesis type 1B, which comprise a spectrum of phenotypes (depending on level of residual sulfate transport) and have been definitively associated with SLC26A2. This gene-disease association is supported by expression studies and in vitro functional assays. In summary, SLC26A2 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive multiple epiphyseal dysplasia. This curation was approved by the Skeletal Disorders Gene Curation Expert Panel (GCEP) on 4/6/2020.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e5781291-86c3-47f2-acfa-a0b99688ce82","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b53d2317-709a-4b12-b846-fa51bfddf7e1","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b53d2317-709a-4b12-b846-fa51bfddf7e1_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10065","date":"2020-10-26T17:17:12.118Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b53d2317-709a-4b12-b846-fa51bfddf7e1_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10065","date":"2020-04-06T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b53d2317-709a-4b12-b846-fa51bfddf7e1_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0760003d-c7f6-4745-84ac-a3ec2bc5f29e_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/47054db6-04cc-4f36-84a6-ec043bd97572","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23613459","rdfs:label":"Syvanen proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":12,"detectionMethod":"SLC26A2 only was sequenced, but the method was not specified.","phenotypeFreeText":"According to the authors, “clinical and radiographic findings were regarded more compatible with rMED than DTD.”  Ultrasound at 17 weeks showed bilateral clubfoot deformity and short femora.
