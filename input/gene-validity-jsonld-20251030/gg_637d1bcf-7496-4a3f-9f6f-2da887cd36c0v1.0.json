At least three unique variants (missense and frameshift) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes both case-level data and experimental data.\nVariants in this gene have been reported in at least 3 probands in 2 publications (PMIDs:34176136, 35174513). Patient symptoms ranged from delayed psychomotor and speech development to apparently asymptomatic. No supporting segregation information is available. The disease mechanism appears to be biallelic loss-of-function, with a deficiency in HIBADH leading to an increase in 3-hydroxyisobutyric acid, a metabolite produced from the multi-step catabolism of Valine and potentially the phenotypes seen in conjunction with the biochemical abnormality. This gene-disease relationship is supported by the biochemical function of 3-Hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase, an enzyme responsible for the conversion of 3-hydroxyisobutyrate to methylmalonate semialdehyde. Biallelic variants in *ALDH6A1* encoding for methylmalonate semialdehyde dehydrogenase (MMSDH) are also associated with 3-hydroxyisobutyric aciduria, with patients presenting with phenotypes ranging from severe developmental delay to virtually asymptomatic (Limited Classification 10/14/2022). \nIn summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. In affected individuals, a low valine diet may improve phenotypes such as developmental delay, however there is insufficient evidence at this time to determine if the clinicla phenotypes observed in these patients are related to the 3-Hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase deficiency.  Although more evidence, genetic and experimental, is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. A classification of limited was approved by the ClinGen Aminoacidopathy GCEP on 3/24/2023 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/637d1bcf-7496-4a3f-9f6f-2da887cd36c0","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d9c11f5a-a86b-4d60-ba51-7c2c8592f60a","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d9c11f5a-a86b-4d60-ba51-7c2c8592f60a_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10011","date":"2023-04-27T14:42:24.765Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d9c11f5a-a86b-4d60-ba51-7c2c8592f60a_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10011","date":"2023-03-24T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d9c11f5a-a86b-4d60-ba51-7c2c8592f60a_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cd4b452f-c5ff-4d26-b8c4-532aee63b3c6_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d178c3ed-7b58-4878-85ce-37c02ccd317a","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Variant is absent from gnomAD.
