The NDUFA12 gene encodes the NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) subunit A12, a non-catalytic complex I accessory protein which plays a role in complex I assembly and function within the mitochondria. Defects of this protein lead to complex I deficiency.\n\nThe NDUFA12 gene has been reported in relation to autosomal recessive Leigh syndrome spectrum in a single publication in 2011 (PMID: 21617257). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data.\n\nThis curation included one homozygous variant identified in one case in one publication (PMID: 21617257).  No segregation data were available. Loss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease association is also supported by known protein interactions and functional alteration in non-patient cells (PMIDs: 24717771, 27509854).\n\nIn summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel August 21, 2019 (SOP Version 7).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d6c202fb-a393-4440-8e6e-11995fb9c6f1","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/81f38f43-5e0c-4cb8-9be8-091f2c8a2c71","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/81f38f43-5e0c-4cb8-9be8-091f2c8a2c71_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2019-11-25T16:08:15.348Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/81f38f43-5e0c-4cb8-9be8-091f2c8a2c71_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/81f38f43-5e0c-4cb8-9be8-091f2c8a2c71_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1eb0ec12-d72e-4a86-b3c2-6d1202de54ea_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The mitochondrial enriched fraction from patient fibroblasts showed an absence of NDUFA12 protein.
