The first reporting of a CHUK variant with symptoms of hypogammaglobinemia was in 2017 (Khandelwal et al., PMID:28513979) however only one pathogenic variant was found. The second pathogenic variant was identified in the proband documented in a current pre-print article by Riller et al., (PMID: 38798321). Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in molecular mechanisms and inheritance pattern; therefore, the following disease entities have been lumped into one disease entities, Cocoon syndrome (OMIM: 613630) and Popliteal pterygium syndrome, Bartoscas-Papas type 2 (OMIM: 619339). \u000b\nSix variants (missense and frameshift) that have been reported in three probands in three publications (PMIDs: 29523099, 34533979, 38798321 - pre-print) are included in this curation. These probands have recurrent upper and lower respiratory infections and hypogammaglobulinemia as well as abnormal skeletal morphology. There are no documented phenotypes reported in carriers of these variants. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss of function \n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence (animal models, expression studies, rescue, and in vitro functional assays,) (PMIDs: 29523099, 34533979, 38798321-pre-print). Expression studies and in vitro functional assays show that non-canonical NF-kB signaling is impaired through the disruption of NIK binding and lack of p100 processing. Expression studies from the pre-print, Riller et al., (2024) showcases that introduction of wildtype CHUK sequence is able to rescue p100 processing and increase nuclear translocation of RELB in transduced fibroblasts (PMID:38798321-pre-print). Animal models are able to capture proband phenotypes and showcase reduced mature B cells, a severe reduction in serum IgG and IgA levels, a reduction in memory and effector T cells, inability to respond to immunization, and recurrent infections.  \u000b\nIn summary, there is moderate evidence supporting the relationship between CHUK and autosomal recessive Popliteal pteryium syndrome, Bartoscas-Papas type 2. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the ClinGen SCID-CID GCEP on the meeting date June 7th, 2024 (SOP Version 10). \n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d6d309e3-fb66-4d98-b073-bf87d0ee7ab1","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c75e589b-683e-4b4f-b2f5-59e1eadf42d1","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c75e589b-683e-4b4f-b2f5-59e1eadf42d1_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10081","date":"2024-06-28T17:48:42.511Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c75e589b-683e-4b4f-b2f5-59e1eadf42d1_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10081","date":"2024-06-07T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c75e589b-683e-4b4f-b2f5-59e1eadf42d1_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c75e589b-683e-4b4f-b2f5-59e1eadf42d1_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1fd5b6f2-5dd0-498e-9498-85b849182361","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The mouse model created was able to showcase phenotypes of the proband that were documented.

They also included NEMOY/- SV40-fibroblasts (NEMO null), known to be unresponsive to TNFα stimulation, as well as the SV40-fibroblasts from a patient carrying the heterozygous NFKB2 p.R853* variant. Upon TNFα stimulation, TNFα induced-genes or genes from the TNFα signaling via NF-κB signature were significantly less upregulated in fibroblasts from the patient than in fibroblasts from controls. Accordingly, pathway activity inference based on previous knowledge (PROGENy) showed a profound defect in the activation of the TNFα signaling. This was confirmed by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (QIAGEN) showing that TNFα, IL1β and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), 3 potent activators of the canonical NF-κB pathway, were in the top 3 molecules predicted to be inhibited based on the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the patient’ cells and control cells. In contrast to the IKKa patient’ cells, the NFKB2 p.R853* patient’s cells were in the range of controls both after TNFα and TLR3 stimulation for NF-κB target genes while NEMO null cells were unable or less able to upregulate genes upon TNFα and TLR3 stimulation, as previously reported.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38798321","rdfs:label":"Riller canonical NF-κB pathway experiment"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ed26c19c-5dd4-4ac2-b02a-cb2265a52c3d","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"This experiment shows that the IKKα Y580C impairs the normal functioning of the protein and its ability to activate noncanonical NF-κB signaling.","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/54fba97c-05de-4f60-aa2f-130584277f82","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Activation of the noncanonical NF-κB pathway was severely impaired in the patient skin-derived fibroblasts, as evidenced by lack of p100 processing after cross-linking of LTβR with agonistic anti-LTβR monoclonal antibody (mAb).
