However, several variants were not scored due to lack of evidence for pathogenicity (PMID: 12136232). USH1C was first associated with this disease in humans in 1998 (Jain et al.). This gene-disease association is supported by 2 mouse models with deletions in the USH1C gene who were deaf but lacked the retinal phenotype of Usher Syndrome I as well as 1 expression study which showed that the longer transcript including the PDZ domain (which is thought to be the region affected to cause NSHL) was only expressed in the ear and not the retina. However, the mouse model from Williams 2009 was not scored because Johnson 2003 found that the mice displayed retinal degeneration at 9 months in addition to circling behavior (PMID: 19324851, 14519688). In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease association. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease association.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/16df4731-b923-43a3-a4cd-ba23489b4c12","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f4194490-1b41-4d6d-be63-4a2a8827bb85","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f4194490-1b41-4d6d-be63-4a2a8827bb85_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f4194490-1b41-4d6d-be63-4a2a8827bb85_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2018-06-11T04:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"Decrease segregation score to 1 point.
