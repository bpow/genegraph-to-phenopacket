Affected individuals develop chronic kidney disease with variable progression to end-stage kidney disease, with a mean age of end-stage kidney disease of approximately 60 years (range 45 to > 85).  Urinalysis reveals a bland urinary sediment.  Deep kidney biopsies or tissue obtained from nephrectomy reveal the deposition of medullary amyloidosis composed of the mutated *APOA4*.  Two missense variants that have been reported in two probands in this publication (PMID: 38096951) are included in the curation. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears related to medullary deposition of the abnormal apolipoprotein. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by expression studies (PMID: 38096951). \n\nIn summary, there is Limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Kidney Cystic and Ciliopathies Disorders GCEP on the meeting date February 28th, 2024 (SOP Version 10).\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d08e4beb-6d9f-43b2-acc4-0957f9ba00de","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/433a4c49-838e-4601-92af-caece99d62eb","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/433a4c49-838e-4601-92af-caece99d62eb_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10066","date":"2024-02-28T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/433a4c49-838e-4601-92af-caece99d62eb_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10066","date":"2025-04-11T18:48:12.567Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/433a4c49-838e-4601-92af-caece99d62eb_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4616517f-526f-4637-93ee-5654565caf15","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4616517f-526f-4637-93ee-5654565caf15_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"Expression
