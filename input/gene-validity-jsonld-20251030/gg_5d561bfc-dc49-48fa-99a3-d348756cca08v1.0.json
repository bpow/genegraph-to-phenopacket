{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5d561bfc-dc49-48fa-99a3-d348756cca08v1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"The relationship between *ISCU* and primary mitochondrial disease was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of October 19, 2023. The *ISCU* gene encodes an iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster assembly enzyme. This is a scaffold protein necessary for the de novo synthesis of Fe-S clusters within mitochondria. This is also important in iron homeostasis and for aconitase activity. There are two isoforms, one cytosolic and one mitochondrial, due to alternative splicing of pre-mRNA.\n\n*ISCU* was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive primary mitochondrial disease in 2008 (PMID: 18304497) in three individuals with myopathy and myoglobinuria (although these individuals were reported in manuscripts from 1991 and 1995, PMIDS: 1918374, 7616539, respectively). While various names have been given to the constellation of features seen in those with *ISCU*-related disease, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *ISCU* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework.\n\nEvidence supporting the gene-disease relationship between *ISCU* and primary mitochondrial disease includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation includes two variants (one splicing founder variant and one missense variant) in eleven probands across five publications (PMIDs: 18296749, 18304497, 19567699, 20206689, 35079622) although additional cases have been reported in the medical literature. Features seen in affected individuals include childhood-onset exercise intolerance/early fatigue, dyspnea, hyperkinetic circulation with tachycardia and palpitations on trivial exercise, ptosis, metabolic acidosis, and rhabdomyolysis. This condition is typically non-progressive with periods of stability. Muscle biopsy shows a distinctive deficiency of several mitochondrial Fe-S proteins (complex I, II, and III; mitochondrial aconitase) as well as iron overload in muscle fibers. Brain imaging was generally normal and affected individuals had variably elevated lactate at rest. \n\nLoss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by known biochemical function, functional alteration in patient cells, yeast models, and a transgenic mouse model expressing human mutated *ISCU* (PMIDs: 33340416, 1918374, 8254022, 20206689, 24573684, 27783661).  \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support this gene-disease relationship, including that more than three years have elapsed since the first proposal of the association. This relationship has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. No convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on October 19, 2023 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5d561bfc-dc49-48fa-99a3-d348756cca08","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/636c0bfd-1dfd-4eb8-af33-3cbb652a2634","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/636c0bfd-1dfd-4eb8-af33-3cbb652a2634_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2024-01-22T16:33:41.111Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/636c0bfd-1dfd-4eb8-af33-3cbb652a2634_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2023-10-19T04:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/636c0bfd-1dfd-4eb8-af33-3cbb652a2634_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2c8e3a98-928d-4675-b9aa-3a70235ec067_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9df86864-d81a-4cba-b6c4-6692686fc7bd","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"This is the scoring recommendation from this GCEP for a recurrent founder variant with strong functional evidence of deleterious impact.","calculatedScore":4,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9df86864-d81a-4cba-b6c4-6692686fc7bd_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"This is the scoring recommendation from this GCEP for a recurrent founder variant with strong functional evidence of deleterious impact.","functionalDataSupport":"Yes"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9df86864-d81a-4cba-b6c4-6692686fc7bd_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18304497","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1509b9de-edda-42c1-a272-c6b56eeac6d0","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_213595.4(ISCU):c.418+382G>C","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA357001"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2c8e3a98-928d-4675-b9aa-3a70235ec067","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18304497","rdfs:label":"Mochel_P2","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1509b9de-edda-42c1-a272-c6b56eeac6d0"},"phenotypeFreeText":"This is a 39y individual with lifelong exercise intolerance, muscle fatigue, shortness of breath, and tachycardia with minor levels of physical exertion and this is associated with episodes of myoglobinuria.
