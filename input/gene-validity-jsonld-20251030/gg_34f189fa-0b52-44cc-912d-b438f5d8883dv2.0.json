At least 5 unique variants have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Summary of Case-Level and Experimental data: 4.2 points. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 5 probands in 4 publications (PMIDs: 25041077, 21263211, 28993341, 17426099). An in vitro functional assay provided evidence that one variant slightly reduces repression of insulin promoter activity (PMID 17426099). \n\nLaver et al (PMID: 3510838) reported a lack of enrichment of ultra-rare (MAF<6x10-6) protein-truncating and missense variants in *BLK*, *PAX4*, and *KLF11* in a large cohort of cases with suspected MODY (n=1227) compared to population cohort (UK Biobank =185,898), gnomADv2 and gnomADv3. They also showed a similar lack of enrichment of protein-truncating variants of any frequency in *BLK*, *PAX4*, and *KLF11* in the MODY cohort. \n\nIn summary, there is limited evidence to support, and there appears to be strong evidence to contradict the *PAX4*-monogenic diabetes relationship that warrants refuting the association (originally asserted as maturity-onset diabetes of the young 9, MODY9, MIM: 612225).  \n\n*PAX4* variants may play a role in susceptibility to polygenic type 2 diabetes (MIM: 125853) and have also been described in relation to susceptibility to an atypical presentation of non-autoimmune diabetes sometimes referred to as “ketosis-prone diabetes” (KPD, MIM: 612227), neither of which will be curated at this time since the contribution would be in the form of common variants with a small effect and moreover, evidence is limited.\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/34f189fa-0b52-44cc-912d-b438f5d8883d","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e2e54103-c1c4-4095-8a12-d602e5326d90","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"NoKnownDiseaseRelationship","changes":[{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},{"id":"cg:sopChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e2e54103-c1c4-4095-8a12-d602e5326d90_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10016","date":"2022-12-14T02:17:48.633Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e2e54103-c1c4-4095-8a12-d602e5326d90_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10016","date":"2022-12-13T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"At the Diabetes UK Professional Conference 2018, Laver et al reported variants in BLK, PAX4, and KLF11 published as pathogenic having a higher frequency in gnomAD than the population frequency of MODY (>0.8% vs. ~0.01%, p < 0.0001), as well as a higher frequency of LoF variants in these genes in gnomAD than the population frequency of MODY.
