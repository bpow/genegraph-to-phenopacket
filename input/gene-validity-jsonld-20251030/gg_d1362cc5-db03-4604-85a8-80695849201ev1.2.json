CFB   codes for a single chain glycoprotein that is a component of the alternative complement pathway, is cleaved by Factor D, and where the C3bBb molecule represents the alternate pathway convertase. CFB was first reported associated with C3 glomerulopathy by Imamura et al (PMID: 25758434). Only three pathogenic variants associated with C3 glomerulonephritis have been reported, two of which have been described previously in atypical Haemolytic uremic syndrome. These variants are missense changes with functional data supporting pathogenicity and have been reported in different publications over time.  The mechanism of pathogenicity is Gain of Function. This gene-disease association for CFB is also supported by biochemical function, protein interactions, altered biochemical function in affected individuals, and by functional alteration in a cell culture model.\n\nIn summary, CFB has a limited association with  C3 glomerulopathy. The association  has been demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. The Expert panel expect that the association will be confirmed more robustly with the demonstration of more CFB variants in patients with C3 glomerulopathy.
