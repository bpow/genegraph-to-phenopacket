TNNI3 was first associated with this disease in humans in 1997 (Kimura et al, PMID 9241277).  At least 60 unique variants, with varying levels of evidence to support their pathogenicity, have been reported in humans (reviewed in Mogensen et al, 2015, PMID 26440512). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in at least 6 families (Kimura et al, 1997, PMID 9241277; Rani et al, 2012, PMID 22876777; Choi et al, 2010, PMID 20641121; Mogensen et al, 2004, PMID 15607392). More evidence is available in the literature , but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts) was reached. The mechanism for disease is likely dominant negative, as 91% of mutations reported are missense variants (Mogensen et al, 2015, PMID 26440512). The gene-disease association is supported by the function of the gene product, animal models, and in vitro assays. In summary, TNNI3 is definitively associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Gene Curation Committee, subgroup of the ClinGen Cardiovascular Working Group, on September 5, 2017.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ef9f6bf9-9a77-451a-9b2f-e1e72660bb4d","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4a7e6901-d478-44c4-bd03-2c344029d4bb","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4a7e6901-d478-44c4-bd03-2c344029d4bb_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10008","date":"2017-09-05T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4a7e6901-d478-44c4-bd03-2c344029d4bb_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10008","date":"2021-01-08T14:56:53.902Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4a7e6901-d478-44c4-bd03-2c344029d4bb_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4a7e6901-d478-44c4-bd03-2c344029d4bb_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/89b0f0c4-a3ff-4d19-ad08-6dbdeb511bf2","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/dc727aaf-a2ed-44dd-b3e9-3e11022acda8","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Using 2-DE and Mass spec, they identified 34 differentially expressed proteins with a 2-fold difference between the G203S OE mutant hearts compared to the WT OE hearts.

Overall: 8.442e-06; Taiwanese HCM cohort. Absent from 200 unrelated control chromosomes; GeneDx: The E124Q variant in the TNNI3 gene was identified in one proband and two of his affected relatives in a study of 38 Taiwanese probands diagnosed with HCM (Chiou et al., 2014). E124Q was not observed in approximately 6,300 individuals of European and African American ancestry in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project, indicating it is not a common benign variant in these populations. The E124Q variant is a semi-conservative amino acid substitution, which may impact secondary protein structure as these residues differ in some properties. This substitution occurs at a position where amino acids with similar properties to Glutamic acid are tolerated across species. Nevertheless, in silico analysis predicts this variant is probably damaging to the protein structure/function.

Van den Wijngaard et al. noted R145W is a founder mutation in the Dutch population and there is variable clinical expression in R145W carriers. Multiple functional studies have noted R145W is located in the region of the gene that is required for inhibition of human cardiac troponin I actomyosin ATPase activity and R145W showed a large increase in Ca2+ sensitivity of both force development, ATPase activity, and other functional impairments (Gomes A et al. 2005; Wen Y et al. 2009). R145W results in a non-conservative amino acid substitution of a positively charged Arginine with a non-polar Tryptophan, which is likely to impact secondary protein structure as these residues differ in polarity, charge, size and/or other properties. The R145 residue is highly conserved across species. Other mutations affecting the same residue (R145Q, R145G) and nearby residues (L144Q, L144P, S150C) have also been reported in association with cardiomyopathy, further supporting the functional importance of this residue and this region of the protein.
