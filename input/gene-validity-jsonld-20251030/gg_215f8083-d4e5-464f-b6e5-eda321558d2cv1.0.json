These variants lead to a variety of overlapping adult onset and congenital myopathies characterized by muscle weakness, hypotonia, myopathic facies, respiratory dysfunction, and rarely cardiac involvement. While nemaline myopathy is the most common presentation, several other myopathies have been reported in association with *ACTA1* mutations. Specific skeletal muscle structural lesions visible on muscle biopsy include actin accumulations, nemaline and intranuclear bodies, fiber-type disproportion, cores, caps, dystrophic features and zebra bodies. Disorders associated with *ACTA1* pathogenic variants can have autosomal dominant (90%) or recessive (10%) inheritance. Per criteria outlined by the Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found differences in molecular mechanism (dominant negative vs. recessive loss of function) and inheritance pattern actinopathy was split into dominant and recessive curations. The dominant curation includes phenotypes across a spectrum of disease including typical and severe infantile congenital myopathy as well as scapulohumeroperoneal myopathy (OMIM 616852, 161800, 620278).\n\n*ACTA1* was first reported in relation to dominant actinopathy in 1999 (Nowak KJ, et al., 1999, PMID: 10508519). At least 190 unique variants (predominantly missense) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 21 probands in 7 publications (PMIDs: 10508519, 25938801, 15468086, 15520409, 20303757, 25747004, 15198992). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in at least 25 additional family members. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence has been reached. In vitro studies suggest that abnormal folding, altered polymerization and aggregation of mutant actin isoforms are common properties of dominant *ACTA1* variants. Some of these effects are mutation-specific, and likely result in variations in the severity of muscle weakness seen in individual patients and to the common pathological hallmarks in skeletal muscle. This gene disease association is supported by its biochemical function in muscle contraction (PMID: 21314430), its skeletal muscle specific expression (PMID: 1743394), the functional alteration of contractility in patient cells (PMID: 29328520) and two knock-in mouse models (PMIDs: 21303860, 22067542) that recapitulate human disease. In summary *ACTA1* is definitively associated with dominant inheritance of actinopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/215f8083-d4e5-464f-b6e5-eda321558d2c","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ba47597e-07a0-45e3-a971-f15807e8a1a4","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ba47597e-07a0-45e3-a971-f15807e8a1a4_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10031","date":"2024-02-26T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ba47597e-07a0-45e3-a971-f15807e8a1a4_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10031","date":"2024-02-26T14:28:27.783Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ba47597e-07a0-45e3-a971-f15807e8a1a4_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d4c51039-3378-460d-b6b4-86ccfe9348a3","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d4c51039-3378-460d-b6b4-86ccfe9348a3_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"Val165Leu (reported by authors as Val163Leu) is supported by evidence from PMID: 15226407 this variant was found to have aberrant nucleotide binding based on tight association with CAP.","functionalDataSupport":"Yes"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d4c51039-3378-460d-b6b4-86ccfe9348a3_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10508519","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/90510c49-09e9-4533-bc69-1fe8dec3b46b","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001100.4(ACTA1):c.493G>C (p.Val165Leu)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA345148678"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:DeNovoAlleleOrigin"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"No","zygosity":{"id":"cg:Heterozygous"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8ae9c090-b207-44a6-98eb-0f7f07b47def","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8ae9c090-b207-44a6-98eb-0f7f07b47def_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"Gly17Arg (reported by authors as Gly15Arg) occurs within the actin domain and region involved in electrostatic interactions as well as hydrogen bonds with beta-phosphates of ATP and ADP.

mice expressing ACTA1(D286G) were created; the ACTA1(D286G) mutation utilized to generate this transgenic mouse model was identified in an isolated patient with severe nemaline myopathy. The force and functional deficits exhibited by Tg(ACTA1)D286G mice recapitulated the weakness observed in patients with ACTA1 mutations. Tg(ACTA1)D286G+/+.Acta1+/+ appeared smaller than littermates shortly after birth, and then presented with a severe splayed leg phenotype and hind limb immobility between postnatal Days 8–17, thus debilitating the pups and requiring them to be euthanized. As a result, Tg(ACTA1)D286G+/+.Acta1+/– mice recapitulate the severe phenotype of most patients with ACTA1 disease.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/772bcbe5-bba1-43e0-9f8c-6b34de605068","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Transgenic dominant KI mice were less active than wild-type individuals. Their skeletal muscles were significantly weaker by in vitro analyses and showed various pathological lesions reminiscent of human patients. Mice homozygous for the transgene and hemizygous for the endogenous skeletal muscle α-actin gene. Akin to most human patients, skeletal muscles from these offspring contained approximately equal proportions of ACTA1(D286G) and wild-type actin. Strikingly, the majority of these mice presented with severe immobility between postnatal Days 8 and 17, requiring euthanasia. Their skeletal muscles contained extensive structural abnormalities as identified in severely affected human patients, including nemaline bodies, actin accumulations and widespread sarcomeric disarray. The correlation between mutant ACTA1 protein load and disease severity parallels effects in ACTA1 families.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21303860","rdfs:label":"KI Mouse","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":3}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ba47597e-07a0-45e3-a971-f15807e8a1a4_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/318b265e-5218-4aca-91c5-529af9c562c5","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/65bba8bc-db38-478d-8c07-8c3062561f82","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Muscle fibers of NEM3 patients display a reduced maximal force generating capacity, which is caused by dysfunctional sarcomere contractility in the majority of patients, as revealed by contractility measurements in myofibrils.
