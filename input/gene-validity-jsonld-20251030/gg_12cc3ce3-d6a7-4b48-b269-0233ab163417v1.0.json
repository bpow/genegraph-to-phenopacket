At least 20 unique variants, mostly nonsense and frameshift, but also a few missense variants have been reported in humans. HPS4 is involved in organelle biogenesis associated with melanosomes, platelet dense granules, and lysosomes. Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome 4 is characterized by oculocutaneous albinism and a bleeding diathesis, but in some cases, also pulmonary fibrosis and granulomatous colitis. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data.  \n  \nSummary of Case Level Data: 12 Points \nVariants in this gene have been reported in at least 9 probands in 7 publications (PMIDs: 24433314, 15108212, 30990103, 30791930, 29108692, 11836498, 31415434). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. \n  \nThe mechanism for disease is homozygous loss of function (PMID: 11836498).   \t \n  \nSummary of Experimental Data: 5 Points \nThis gene-disease association is supported by animal models and in vitro functional assays. The \"light ear\" or le mouse that carries a spontaneously occurring mutation in Hps4 recapitulates the human HPS phenotype (PMID: 11836498). Another spontaneously occurring HPS4 mutation is identified to be the cause of albinism in channel catfish (PMID: 28289846). HPS4 interacts with HPS1 to form BLOC-3, which is involved in the biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles (PMID: 11836498, 23103514).  \n\nIn summary, HPS4 is definitively associated with Autosomal Recessive Hermasky-Pudlak syndrome 4. \nThis has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hemostasis/Thrombosis GCEP on May 27, 2020 (SOP Version 7).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/12cc3ce3-d6a7-4b48-b269-0233ab163417","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3649fe18-730d-4d46-ad60-b70d421abc02","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3649fe18-730d-4d46-ad60-b70d421abc02_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2020-09-16T19:23:10.948Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3649fe18-730d-4d46-ad60-b70d421abc02_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2020-05-27T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3649fe18-730d-4d46-ad60-b70d421abc02_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e70d9eeb-9d7a-4038-a4f0-9627fb6fc635_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The proband and his similarly affected sister were homozygous for the 1-bp duplication in exon 4 that results in a frameshift and premature termination in exon 10.
