At least 33 unique variants (e.g. missense, nonsense, and frameshifts) have been reported in humans. The unifying feature of all of the mutations is the\nability of the mutation to disrupt the assembly and/or function of a surface-expressed GP Ib-IX-V complex. How individual mutations affect complex assembly or surface expression can be variable. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and\nexperimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 8 probands in 8 publications (PMIDs: 9116284, 12693941, 12958615, 10887115, 12447957, 12945881, 16409472, 16978236). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 3 additional family members. More\nevidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic and experimental evidence has been reached. This gene-disease association is supported by its biochemical function in the GP1b platelet receptor for VWF (PMID: 3258770), its protein interactions with GP1BA\nand GP9 (PMID: 808914), functional alteration in non-patient cells (PMID: 16409472), a knock-out animal model (PMID: 15213102), and rescue of the animal model with human GP1BB (PMID: 27148783). In summary, GP1BB is definitively associated with autosomal recessive\nBernard-Soulier syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. Of note, this gene has also been implicated in autosomal dominant isolated inherited macrothrombocytopenia\n(MONDO:0016361). Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found interfamilial phenotypic variability is observed between individuals harboring the same genetic variant between different inheritance patterns and the difference in the inheritance\npattern for the disease entities is representative of a continuum of disease, i.e. mild carrier phenotypic features are observed in recessive disease. Thus the disease entities were lumped and the well-established autosomal recessive inheritance pattern has been curated here;\nadditional mono-allelic manifestations have also been reported (PMIDs: 28064200, 30609015, 25370924, 29527674).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8acbcb4a-e9e9-484e-a40f-0268119cd59a","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2064876d-ea54-4ace-be76-f700cfefbf90","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2064876d-ea54-4ace-be76-f700cfefbf90_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2019-06-06T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ceea43a3-a8c3-479a-926a-bc8bad88fb3e_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Unpublisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2064876d-ea54-4ace-be76-f700cfefbf90_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2064876d-ea54-4ace-be76-f700cfefbf90_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2064876d-ea54-4ace-be76-f700cfefbf90_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9987e68a-e756-4584-8a10-c5e071cf5329","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The null mouse model, in which a targeting vector replaced GP Ibβ exon 2 with a neo-r cassette, recapitulates human phenotypes of large platelets, thrombocytopenia, and prolonged bleeding times.
