These variants lead to a variety of overlapping adult onset and congenital myopathies characterized by muscle weakness, hypotonia, myopathic face, respiratory dysfunction, and rarely cardiac involvement. While nemaline myopathy is the most common presentation, several other myopathies have been reported in association with ACTA1 mutations. \nSpecific skeletal muscle structural lesions visible on muscle biopsy include actin accumulations, nemaline and intranuclear bodies, fiber-type disproportion, cores, caps, dystrophic features and zebra bodies. Disorders associated with ACTA1 pathogenic variants can have autosomal dominant (90%) or recessive (10%) inheritance. Per criteria outlined by the Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found the absence of clearly defined and/or distinct differences in molecular mechanism, coupled with noted phenotypic variability (both intra- and inter-familial) for individual variants, indicating that these entities are part of the same clinical spectrum. ACTA1 was first reported in relation to semidominant actinopathy in 1994 (Nowak KJ, et al., 1999, PMID: 10508519). At least 190 unique variants (primarily missense but also nonsense, frameshift, splicing, etc.) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 24 probands in 7 publications (PMIDs: 25938801, 25747004, 17187373, 15468086, 15520409, 20303757). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in at least 8 additional family members. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence has been reached. This gene disease association is supported by its biochemical function in muscle contraction, its skeletal muscle specific expression, the functional alteration of contractility in patient cells (PMID: 29328520) and both a null mouse (PMID: 12138199) and a knock-in mouse model (PMID: 21303860) that recapitulate human disease. In summary ACTA1 is definitively associated with semidominant inheritance of actinopathy.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/36d228c5-16d6-41e2-80e2-a086cb33c340","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9a8d04be-c08f-444b-b9cd-cd7de2e282c2","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9a8d04be-c08f-444b-b9cd-cd7de2e282c2_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10031","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9a8d04be-c08f-444b-b9cd-cd7de2e282c2_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10031","date":"2020-01-13T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9a8d04be-c08f-444b-b9cd-cd7de2e282c2_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8c121824-70fa-4522-b68a-1d4954643a7f_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The homozygous frameshift variant Tyr364Ter immediately generates a premature stop codon but is located in the final exon and not expected to result in NMD; however Western blot confirmed complete absence in patient muscle.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4ae48d51-67f4-4dbc-a036-bbedb4154f95","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17187373","rdfs:label":"Patient 2","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":4,"detectionMethod":"The α‐skeletal muscle actin gene (ACTA1) was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction amplification, and each of the six coding exons was sequenced.","firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypeFreeText":"absent antigravity movements","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001662","obo:HP_0003458","obo:HP_0002803","obo:HP_0001252","obo:HP_0002421","obo:HP_0030319","obo:HP_0002015","obo:HP_0002093","obo:HP_0011968","obo:HP_0001270","obo:HP_0003690"],"previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"Quadricep muscle biopsy showed excess connective and adipose tissue and multiple small nemaline rods.","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8c121824-70fa-4522-b68a-1d4954643a7f_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17187373","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2692ec4a-4efe-4ea7-9c4c-b4780ea7fdd2","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001100.3(ACTA1):c.1092del (p.Tyr364Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA915940544"}}},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:BiallelicHomozygous"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/52a21033-f2e5-4ecd-9330-72d481c4b4e0_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The compound heterozygous missense variants Leu96Pro and Glu261Val (reported by authors as Leu94Pro and Glu259Val) are not supported by functional evidence in PMID: 15226407; when expressed in reticulocyte lysates these variants were improperly folded and were not released from CCT and prefoldin.

In addition, zebrafish injected with RNA encoding either wild type or Glu197Asp human ACTA1 displayed no abnormalities in their morphology or muscle histology up to 6 days after fertilization, including no actin accumulations or sarcomeric disorganization.
