It forms the BCDX2 complex with RAD51B, RAD51C, and RAD51D, and is required for HR repair. XRCC2 was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Fanconi anemia, complementation group U in 2012 (Shamseldin HE, et al., PMID: 22232082). Fanconi anemia is a rare hereditary disease characterized by genomic instability, developmental abnormalities, bone marrow failure and cancer predisposition, mainly leukemia and solid tumors. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we have split autosomal dominant hereditary breast cancer into separate curations due to phenotypic variability and different inheritance patterns. Therefore, this curation solely focuses on autosomal recessive FA-U. The mechanism of pathogenicity is loss of function. One homozygous nonsense variant has been reported in one proband in two publications (3 Points, PMIDs: 22232082, 27208205) is included in this curation. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence (2 Points). in vitro functional assays (PMID: 27208205) showed that cells (900677A) from a previously identified patient with biallelic mutation of XRCC2 display cellular hypersensitivity to DNA interstrand crosslinking agent or IR, similar to cells with deficiencies with other well-known FA genes. Importantly, these cellular phenotypes can be rescued by expression of wildtype XRCC2. In summary, there is limited evidence supporting the relationship between XRCC2 and autosomal recessive inheritance Fanconi anemia, complementation group U . This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hereditary Cancer GCEP on the meeting date October 27, 2023 (SOP Version 9).
