At least 15 unique variants (primarily nonsense, along with other LoF splicing and frameshift variants, and few inactivating missense variants) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 18 probands in 6 publications (PMIDs: 18779414, 19234463, 19234460, 19064721, 21441448, 22139635). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in two additional family members. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic and experimental evidence has been reached. This gene-disease relationship is supported by the enhanced expression of FERMT3 in hematopoietic tissues, its biochemical function in integrin activation which is altered in patient cells but can be rescued, and a null mouse model which recapitulates both cellular defects and clinical phenotypes observed in human LAD-III patients. In summary, FERMT3 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive leukocyte adhesion deficiency 3. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/adfa3690-e31f-4008-a916-83e4897b8eac","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/df792161-5efb-45f7-91ed-5fe76045fa06","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/df792161-5efb-45f7-91ed-5fe76045fa06_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/df792161-5efb-45f7-91ed-5fe76045fa06_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2019-08-28T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/df792161-5efb-45f7-91ed-5fe76045fa06_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/df792161-5efb-45f7-91ed-5fe76045fa06_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/511d7e81-5ac3-4715-85be-d925ee859945","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The FERMT3 null mouse model recapitulates both cellular defects and clinical phenotypes observed in human LAD-III patients.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0ad32f90-90a9-4a51-8bf7-0b128344cbd5","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Both the mouse and human patients had osteopetrosis and severe hemorrhages with platelets that fail to aggregate in response to physiological agonists and are deficient in fibrinogen binding.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18278053","rdfs:label":"FERMT3 null mouse","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/79701d33-78b8-4506-acd9-a3741b2d9541","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The failure of lymphocytes from subjects with LAD-III to adhere and spread, as is typical of the LAD-III phenotype, is restored by expression of wild-type FERMT3.
