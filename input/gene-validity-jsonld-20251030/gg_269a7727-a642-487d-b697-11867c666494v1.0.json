At least 81 unique likely pathogenic or pathogenic variants (missense, nonsense, frameshift) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data. NPHP4 has been noted to be associated with nephronophthisis and Senior-Løken syndrome. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group we found no significant differences in molecular mechanisms and inheritance patterns, therefore, the disease entities have been lumped into the term NPHP-NPHP4. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 7 probands in 5 publications (PMIDs: 12244321, 23354436, 1577426, 23188109, 23559409). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 2 additional family members. The mechanism for disease is biallelic loss of function. This gene-disease association is supported by animal models, expression studies, rescued cell culture assays, and protein interactions (PMIDs: 15661758, 19755384, 16339905, 21078623, 15817158). In summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between NPHP4 and autosomal recessive NPHP-NPHP4. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Cystic and Ciliopathy Expert Panel on the meeting date 2/10/21 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/269a7727-a642-487d-b697-11867c666494","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cafd0d51-dd5d-4691-8725-86518345b097","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cafd0d51-dd5d-4691-8725-86518345b097_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10066","date":"2021-02-10T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cafd0d51-dd5d-4691-8725-86518345b097_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10066","date":"2021-02-26T18:06:20.290Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cafd0d51-dd5d-4691-8725-86518345b097_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cafd0d51-dd5d-4691-8725-86518345b097_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0305f6ab-99a4-4507-ae2b-7eb31be47330","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Downgraded because phenotype was not very specific but still shows that disruption of NPHP4 leads to an abnormal ciliary phenotype.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/045c54d0-dd7c-47d7-8614-3b48f2da4ec7","type":"Finding","dc:description":"While the overt phenotypes of the round worm and human do not overlap, the NPHP1-NPHP4 double mutants show defective polycysin-mediated mating behavior suggesting NPHP4 affects one of the many ciliary functions.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15817158","rdfs:label":"C. elegans worm model","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fccd077b-ad97-44be-afce-b178673b08f3","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Downgraded because these mice to do not display any abnormal renal phenotypes.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4d3698b2-ebf0-4d53-9bdd-2ee7f362d570","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Both humans and mice display retinal abnormalities suggesting some phenotypic overlap between the loss of function of NPHP4 in mice and humans.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21078623","rdfs:label":"Mouse Model","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/37812892-8c20-4cbb-b486-8ec9e87a48d9","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ea1e34e9-6da4-4db3-a4bc-1ff599aa9409","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Excising the sh-RNA led to rescue of more normal ciliary lengths and morphology and also led to rescue of expression of NPHP4","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19755384","rdfs:label":"Cre recombinase rescue in MDCK cells","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:PhenotypeRescue"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCellCultureRescueCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cafd0d51-dd5d-4691-8725-86518345b097_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/28320310-6476-4773-8ae9-0a59f89604ea","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/eeab086c-1109-4b94-ad55-a379d1300478","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Both NPHP1 and NPHP4 are associated with nephronopthisis and interact in human kidney cell types.
