Clinical characteristics of this disorder include limb shortening, hitchhiker thumbs, spinal deformities, joint contractures, and early-onset osteoarthritis (GeneReviews, Bonafé et al., 2013). However, radiographic analysis and histopathology are also important in arriving at a diagnosis. At least 12 unique variants (including missense, splice site, and nonsense variants as well as in-frame indels) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 7 probands in 6 publications (PMID: 30423444, 18553123, 29724173, 18925670, 15316973, 21155763) and segregated with disease in 1 additional family member. More evidence is available in the literature; however, the maximum score for genetic evidence has been reached. Of note, variants in this gene have also been shown to cause recessive multiple epiphyseal dysplasia, atelosteogenesis type 2, and achondrogenesis type 1B, which comprise a spectrum of phenotypes (depending on level of residual sulfate transport) and have been definitively associated with SLC26A2. This gene-disease association is supported by a mouse model, expression studies, and in vitro functional assays. In summary, SLC26A2 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive diastrophic dysplasia. This curation was approved by the Skeletal Disorders Gene Curation Expert Panel (GCEP) on 6/1/2020.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/848fdf14-6f8e-4ced-a97c-08745b733e51","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/311c9799-169e-4409-98bd-74b6d414904c","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/311c9799-169e-4409-98bd-74b6d414904c_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10065","date":"2020-06-01T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/311c9799-169e-4409-98bd-74b6d414904c_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10065","date":"2020-10-26T17:19:32.553Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/311c9799-169e-4409-98bd-74b6d414904c_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/311c9799-169e-4409-98bd-74b6d414904c_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/446bf3b1-283c-442d-a944-fdc7312d73d7","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fa104581-5222-4270-91f3-e5d71149fec2","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Immunohistochemistry

Short stature became obvious at 3 yr of age (at 4 yr, height was -3 SD).","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0011800","obo:HP_0001762","obo:HP_0032153","obo:HP_0004322","obo:HP_0001371","obo:HP_0009826","obo:HP_0005622","obo:HP_0001382"],"previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/061491f8-2ffc-4122-9c5c-344d81ce27b8_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18553123","allele":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/27bf6fb9-e4cb-46f3-88fc-a2581286ac2d","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000112.4(SLC26A2):c.1011_1013TGT[3] (p.Val341del)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA259846"}},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b6822b7e-75ab-4c53-8c07-0cd2aa19c9e3","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000112.3(SLC26A2):c.797C>T (p.Thr266Ile)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/550140"}}],"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:DeNovoAlleleOrigin"}}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":2.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/484179d0-0aa2-4723-9fd9-2a29e79cdbd6_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Inconclusive","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7fc88c2e-7afa-49e6-aff8-0b117c51ae4a","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30423444","rdfs:label":"Kausar patient II","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":5,"detectionMethod":"Method not specified.
