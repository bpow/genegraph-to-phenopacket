POLD1 was first reported as part of an autosomal dominant cancer susceptibility condition in 2013 (Palles et al, PMID: 23263490). Likely pathogenic/ pathogenic variants located within the region of the gene that encodes the exonuclease domain of POLD1 are associated with an increased risk of colon polyps and colorectal cancer. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in molecular mechanism(s), inheritance pattern and phenotypic variability between susceptibility to colon cancer and colon polyps. Therefore, the following disease entities have been lumped into POLD1-related polyposis and colorectal cancer syndrome (MONDO:0100351). However, due to the phenotypic difference and different molecular mechanism of the pathogenic variants autosomal dominant mandibular hypoplasia, deafness, progeroid features, and lipodystrophy syndrome (MDPL) OMIM 615381 - has been split from this curation. With regard to evidence, 9 missense variants that have been reported in three publications (PMIDs: 26133394, 25559809, 33948826) are included in this curation (10 points). This gene-disease association is also supported by experimental evidence (2.5 points) including mouse, yeast and cell culture models (PMIDs: 19966286, 26087769, 12429860, 19805137). Cells with  specific POLD1 variants mirroring those found in humans demonstrated low-fidelity DNA synthesis, leading to increased DNA damage. Pold1 mutant (D400A/D400A) mice also had increased spontaneous mutation rates and developed cancers. In summary, POLD1 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant POLD1-related polyposis and colorectal cancer syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the Colon Cancer Expert Panel on 04/10/2017. The ClinGen Hereditary Cancer GCEP reevaluated on 02/24/2023 (SOP Version 9). As a result of this reevaluation, the classification did not change although the  disease name was changed to mirror both features of the disorder.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e014e1bb-4c44-40df-a12f-237ced899fc4","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c064a017-9158-4eb5-8ea4-036e53798d2c","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c064a017-9158-4eb5-8ea4-036e53798d2c_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10023","date":"2023-07-05T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c064a017-9158-4eb5-8ea4-036e53798d2c_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10023","date":"2023-07-05T18:28:35.466Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c064a017-9158-4eb5-8ea4-036e53798d2c_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c064a017-9158-4eb5-8ea4-036e53798d2c_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/06ff72c3-aded-4a84-b0e6-ca1b25be4e50","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"No data about heterozygous Pold1 depletion mice.
