Deficiency of *CSF2RB* results in alveolar macrophage dysfunction, which leads to impaired clearance and accumulation of surfactant in the alveoli and terminal bronchioles. This accumulation results in *CSF2RB*-related surfactant metabolism dysfunction, or pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, with various characteristics including ground-glass opacities with interlobular or intralobular septal thickening, resulting in a “crazy-paving” pattern on radiograph, enlarged foamy alveolar macrophages, dyspnea, and respiratory failure (Tanaka T, et al., PMID: 21075760). The age of onset for those presenting with isolated interstitial lung disease ranges from childhood to adulthood. \n\nFour variants (2 frameshift, 1 nonsense, and 1 missense) that have been reported in 4 probands across 4 publications (PMIDs: 21075760, 21205713, 38259275, 38111540) are included in this curation. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss of function.\n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by expression studies showing reduced or absent expression of beta chain (*CSF2RB*) in patients with PAP (PMID: 9410898), biochemical function assays demonstrating the role of signaling pathways in surfactant clearance (PMID: 21075760), animal models that recapitulate the human phenotype and a rescue of that phenotype with pulmonary macrophage transplantation (PMID: 25274301). \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *CSF2RB* and autosomal recessive *CSF2RB*-related surfactant metabolism dysfunction. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Interstitial Lung Diseases GCEP on the meeting date September 17, 2024 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3cb3c895-f3a1-43ba-b3d6-793ff5f9d8c2","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/820769fa-c7cb-4d98-ae3d-fb2cd0ae93b9","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/820769fa-c7cb-4d98-ae3d-fb2cd0ae93b9_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10138","date":"2024-09-17T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/820769fa-c7cb-4d98-ae3d-fb2cd0ae93b9_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10138","date":"2024-12-02T21:27:29.329Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/820769fa-c7cb-4d98-ae3d-fb2cd0ae93b9_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/820769fa-c7cb-4d98-ae3d-fb2cd0ae93b9_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0cb42fb6-9ffc-4655-b180-1ea65e550980","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The CSF2RB mouse model recapitulates most human phenotypes both at the organ/organismal level and at the molecular/cellular level, and has a consistent mode of inheritance. \n","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/84a23ee0-4753-4540-9c84-165f0afdc21a","type":"Finding","dc:description":"CSF2RB KO mice develop a myeloid cell disorder which is identical to hereditary pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (HPAP/SMDP) in children with CSF2RA or CSF2RB mutations.
