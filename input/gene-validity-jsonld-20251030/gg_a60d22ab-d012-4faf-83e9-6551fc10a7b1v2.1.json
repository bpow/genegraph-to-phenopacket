Since that time, the range of common patient phenotypes has expanded to include reduced visual acuity, macular atrophy, nyctalopia, photopsia, constriction of peripheral visual field, photophobia, and chorioretinal atrophy. Additional extraocular phenotypes such as situs inversus totalis, asthenozoospermia, or reduced sperm motility have been reported as well. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping & Splitting Working Group, the mode of inheritance (autosomal recessive) and molecular mechanism (biallelic *ARL2BP* loss of function) have been found to be consistent among patients diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa 82 with or without situs inversus, while the phenotypic variability between cases appears to represent a spectrum of disease rather than separate disease entities. Therefore, cases caused by inherited biallelic *ARL2BP* variants have been lumped into a single disease entity, referred to as \"ARL2BP-related ciliopathy\".\n\nThis curation includes 7 variants ( 2 frameshift, 1 missense, and 4 disrupting canonical splice sites) that have collectively been reported in 7 probands in 5 publications (PMID: 23849777, 27790702, 31425546, 36507858, 38649918). All of the included probands were born into consanguineous families, and all were diagnosed during adulthood after experiencing a variety of ocular symptoms during childhood. Overall, the mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be biallelic loss of function, as indicated by the variant types found in the probands.\n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence that ARL2BP protein localizes to the base of the cilia in mouse fibroblast cells and human retinal pigment epithelial cells (PMID: 23849777). This matches the localizations of the retinopathy-related gene products RPGR, RP1 and MAK to the ciliary basal body and rootlet (PMID: 29718757). In the absence of ARL2BP, the length and formation of cilia are affected, and photoreceptor outer segment does not develop normally or have correct doublet microtubule formation, axoneme extension, or disk alignment (PMID: 23849777). Multiple mouse knockout models, including a global knockout generated by CRISPR-Cas9, showed loss of photoreceptor nuclei in the outer nuclear layer, consistent with retinal layer atrophy in affected human patients (PMID: 29718757, PMID: 31425546). The mouse model also exhibited situs inversus and immotile sperm (PMID: 31425546).\n\nIn conclusion, *ARL2BP* has a definitive association with ARL2BP-related ciliopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both research and diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time without the emergence of contradictory evidence. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Retina Gene Curation Expert Panel on January 2nd, 2025 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a60d22ab-d012-4faf-83e9-6551fc10a7b1","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/afe2baae-73d8-4f77-a106-a9163dbde4ce","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":[{"id":"cg:sopChange"},{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/afe2baae-73d8-4f77-a106-a9163dbde4ce_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10072","date":"2025-01-02T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/afe2baae-73d8-4f77-a106-a9163dbde4ce_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10072","date":"2025-06-13T19:45:34.263Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["DiseaseNameUpdate"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/afe2baae-73d8-4f77-a106-a9163dbde4ce_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/dd0052d6-a17c-403a-836c-ac172be7ef32_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/dd0052d6-a17c-403a-836c-ac172be7ef32","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27790702","rdfs:label":"CIC01154","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":36,"allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ac03a8e3-da99-4478-b0c4-5a1fbf9b7cae","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_012106.4(ARL2BP):c.207+1G>T","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA8074877"}},"detectionMethod":"WES.","phenotypeFreeText":"Moroccan female proband has an affected sibling, an unaffected sibling and consanguineous parents.\n\nThe proband's best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 20/200 on the right and counting finger on the left with visual fields below 10°.\n\nFundus examination (Fig. 1b) revealed typical signs of RCD with additional atrophic macular changes.","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0000510","obo:HP_0007663","obo:HP_0001123","obo:HP_0007401"],"sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0e0272aa-a2d9-4bd2-a829-584e48349ac6_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27790702","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ac03a8e3-da99-4478-b0c4-5a1fbf9b7cae"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"}}},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0e0272aa-a2d9-4bd2-a829-584e48349ac6","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Downscored for consanguinity.","calculatedScore":3.0,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0e0272aa-a2d9-4bd2-a829-584e48349ac6_variant_evidence_item"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/637791b6-f586-4598-a0b9-c495f915f140_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/637791b6-f586-4598-a0b9-c495f915f140","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23849777","rdfs:label":"IV-3","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":48,"allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6c692033-d9ae-4986-bf1e-b21e4ef59ae4","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_012106.4(ARL2BP):c.134T>G (p.Met45Arg)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA144805"}},"detectionMethod":"WES.","phenotypeFreeText":"The proband is a white male of European descent who has consanguineous parents.

Genetic analysis identified a likely pathogenic homozygous variant (c.294-1G > C) involving the splicing acceptor site of intron 4. Reported symptoms together with full-field stimulus threshold testing, electroretinogram and advanced multimodal imaging allowed us to recognize the typical characteristics of a mixed retinal dystrophy. Despite the end-stage retinal disease, this patient still retained a useful residual vision at 63 years and had a slow disease progression during the last 5 years of evaluation.\n\nThe patient reported a history of night blindness (NB) and visual field constriction (VFC) since he was 30 years old, preceded by photophobia and episodes of photopsia already noted ten years before. Diagnosis of arRP was made when he was 32 years old and both NB and VFC became prominent at 35, when light aversion also developed. The patient could no longer drive by the age of 39.\n\nWhen he was 49 years old, visual acuity was 20/200 in both eyes with a fundus characterized by attenuated vessels, rare bone spicule-like deposits scattered in mid-periphery and prominent patches of 360° chorioretinal nummular atrophy in far periphery. Goldmann Visual Field showed a marked constriction in both eyes (< 10° with the V/4e target) while optical coherence tomography (OCT) showed a widespread reduction of the outer nuclear layer and RNFL attenuation with RGC axonal loss, more evident in the right eye (RE) compared to the left (LE).\n\nAt 50 years a sudden drop in visual acuity occurred (BCVA RE: hand motion; BCVA LE: 20/400) with coincidental findings of an active anterior uveitis treated with periocular injections of depot steroids in both eyes.

Proband was first diagnosed with myopia at age 8 and developed night blindness and photopsia by the age of 26. Over the following 10 years, he developed a progressive loss of vision and bilateral constriction of the peripheral visual fields. The patient noticed a more pronounced reduction in visual acuity at age 37, associated with onset of photophobia (both eyes), and later, metamorphopsia in the right eye.\n\nAt age 42, his best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 0.2 in the right eye (OD) and 0.25 in the left eye (OS). Slit-lamp examination revealed moderate opacities of the crystalline lenses and generalized chorioretinal atrophy, including punched-out lesions, affecting the periphery and the posterior pole, upon dilated fundus examination (Fig 2A). Scarce pigment deposits were visible in the peripheral retina as well as bilateral optic disc pallor and attenuated retinal vessels (defining the characteristic triad of retinitis pigmentosa). Fluorescence angiography showed generalized window defects and atrophy of the photoreceptor/pigment epithelium complex. Fundus autofluorescence showed spotty areas of hypo-autofluorescence outside of the vascular arcades and a central ring of hyper-autofluorescence in the posterior pole (Fig 2C).\n\nAt last examination, at age 43, marked progression of peripheral visual field constriction was noted in both eyes, which was more severe in the OD (limited to the central 10–15 degrees). Spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) revealed pronounced atrophy of the retinal layers, with enhanced visualization of the choroidal vessels (Fig 2E). Electroretinograms (ERG) showed no response to light stimuli, either from cone or from rod photoreceptor cells (S1 Fig).\n\nThe patient’s past medical history revealed cardiac arrhythmia under bisoprolol treatment and infertility. Due to unsuccessful conception, a full spermiogram analysis was performed, the diagnosis resulting in severe asthenozoospermia (complete absence of motility).","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0003251","obo:HP_0012207","obo:HP_0001133","obo:HP_0000543","obo:HP_0007688","obo:HP_0000529","obo:HP_0000533","obo:HP_0032559","obo:HP_0030786","obo:HP_0011675","obo:HP_0007663","obo:HP_0000613","obo:HP_0000662","obo:HP_0012508","obo:HP_0000545"],"sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/96d8d52d-d183-45fa-b938-3d7d451a0950_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31425546","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ceaf0b76-5871-43ca-8b42-76f2ba2161a7"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"}}},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/96d8d52d-d183-45fa-b938-3d7d451a0950","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Downscored for consanguinity.","calculatedScore":3.0,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/96d8d52d-d183-45fa-b938-3d7d451a0950_variant_evidence_item"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e85c3168-aba3-4081-b895-899f570196f0_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e85c3168-aba3-4081-b895-899f570196f0","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31425546","rdfs:label":"LL89","ageType":"AgeAtDiagnosis","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":36,"allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a23561b4-7d36-4d30-9c73-70e5f226ac88","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_012106.4(ARL2BP):c.33_36del (p.Phe13ProfsTer15)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA2580617535"}},"detectionMethod":"WES and Sanger.","phenotypeFreeText":"Proband was born a from consanguineous union between first degree cousins of Portuguese origin. She was diagnosed with a classical form of retinitis pigmentosa at the age of 36 years.\n\nInitial visual complaints started with photophobia at 11 years of age and progressed to night blindness and photopsia by the age of 25. Constriction of the peripheral visual field was noted at the age of 28. Disease progression led to a sharp reduction in visual acuity at age 38 and to loss of color vision by the age of 40. The patient underwent cataract surgery at age 40 and 48. At 50 she developed metamorphopsia in the OS.\n\nAt the last ophthalmologic examination, patient P2 showed a BCVA of 0.3 in the OD, 0.16 in the OS, and severe constriction of the peripheral visual field, with bilateral tunnel-like vision, restricted to the 5 degrees central. Dilated fundus examination revealed attenuated retinal vessels, pale optic discs (Fig 2B) and a marked generalized chorioretinal atrophy in the posterior pole and in the periphery, with areas of complete atrophy in the inferior peripheral region of the right eye. Mild to moderate mottled pigment deposition in the retinal periphery, along with some irregular white patches in the posterior pole near the superior vessels, was also observed. Fundus autofluorescence was notable for generalized hypo-autofluorescence with a wide hyper-autofluorescent ring in the posterior pole (Fig 2D). SD-OCT revealed pronounced atrophy of the outer retinal layers and the presence of a foveal cyst (Fig 2F).\n\nP2 gave birth to two children.\n\nP2 displays a pale optic disc, vascular thinning and marked retinal changes, with opalescent areas of the retinal tissue in the periphery and central atrophic lesion. Scarse pigment deposition can also be found adjacent to the optic nerve head and periphery.\n\nP2 suffered from frequent migraines and recently underwent a cerebral CT imaging examination, which revealed normal ventricular volumes and absence of other morphological anomalies.","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0000543","obo:HP_0030786","obo:HP_0007663","obo:HP_0001133","obo:HP_0002076","obo:HP_0000662","obo:HP_0000551","obo:HP_0012508","obo:HP_0000533","obo:HP_0000613"],"sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a92d2754-44e1-4cff-9999-25b5690c3189_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31425546","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a23561b4-7d36-4d30-9c73-70e5f226ac88"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"}}},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a92d2754-44e1-4cff-9999-25b5690c3189","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Downscored for consanguinity.","calculatedScore":3.0,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a92d2754-44e1-4cff-9999-25b5690c3189_variant_evidence_item"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bcf3cee8-9e6e-423b-b670-b419de399f96_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bcf3cee8-9e6e-423b-b670-b419de399f96","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23849777","rdfs:label":"IV-2","ageType":"AgeAtDiagnosis","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":33,"allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0e1f6056-04b3-4b91-81ba-40b8af0b9e8d","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_012106.4(ARL2BP):c.101-1G>C","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA10575604"}},"detectionMethod":"WES.","phenotypeFreeText":"Male proband of Arab-Muslim origin has consanguineous parents.\n\nProband was noted to find have visual acuity of 0.2 in the right eye (RE) and 0.4 in the left eye (LE), and his Goldmann visual fields were constricted to 10°–12° with the V4e target.\n\nInterestingly, all three siblings displayed a marked component of macular atrophy, including smaller and larger atrophic patches, as well as epiretinal membranes with wrinkling of the retina (Figures 2A–2D).
