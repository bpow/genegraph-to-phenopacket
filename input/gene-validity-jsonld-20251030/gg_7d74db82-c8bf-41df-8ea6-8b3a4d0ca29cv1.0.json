Eight missense, frameshift, nonsense and splice-site variants reported in humans were included in this curation, however approximately 1000 pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in this gene have been reported in ClinVar. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 8 probands in 7 publications (10563487, 14993485, 23085274, 25572247, 27725546, 28542346, 27796712). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 18 additional family members. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. This gene-disease association is supported by knock-in mouse models and expression studies in humans (15153557, 30582011, 16301374). In summary, COL4A5 is definitely associated with X-linked Alport syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.  This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hearing Loss Working Group on 3/19/19 (SOP Version 6).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7d74db82-c8bf-41df-8ea6-8b3a4d0ca29c","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0407dc2e-1cab-4043-889d-4695b043d7b3","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0407dc2e-1cab-4043-889d-4695b043d7b3_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0407dc2e-1cab-4043-889d-4695b043d7b3_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2019-03-19T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0407dc2e-1cab-4043-889d-4695b043d7b3_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0407dc2e-1cab-4043-889d-4695b043d7b3_ad_null_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a8a69d36-9b4f-4a7b-8d93-e779d95a6916_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Variant is absent from gnomAD.

No staining was noted for the alpha5 chain antibody in both Alport cases.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16301374","rdfs:label":"Zehnder Patient Expression","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionB"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":5}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":152,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria6","strengthScore":17,"subject":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ZvK9QXgUgn8","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0018965","gene":"hgnc:2207","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0001417"},"version":"1.0","websiteLegacyID":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/assertion_0407dc2e-1cab-4043-889d-4695b043d7b3-","@context":{"@vocab":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"},"curationReasons":{"@type":"@vocab","@container":"@set"},"GCISnapshot":{"@type":"@id"},"dc:isVersionOf":{"@type":"@id"},"websiteLegacyID":{"@type":"@id"}}}
