Over 400 unique variants (including missense, nonsense, splicing and frameshift variants) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 18 probands in 5 publications (PMIDs: 8298131, 10063989, 7545463, 20484936, 10447256). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 33 additional family members. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic and experimental evidence has been reached. This gene-disease relationship is supported by its biochemical function as a cofactor for Protein C (PMID: 6892911), and both heterozygous and null mouse models which recapitulate phenotypes observed in humans (PMID: 19567881). In summary, PROS1 is definitively associated with semidominant protein S deficiency. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4223e14f-822e-4837-a930-cf5c3dd3781f","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/10e3af9d-80aa-4934-b592-594b1bd1cd92","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":[{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"},{"id":"cg:summaryChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/10e3af9d-80aa-4934-b592-594b1bd1cd92_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2025-01-10T20:28:30.354Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/10e3af9d-80aa-4934-b592-594b1bd1cd92_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2020-01-22T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["DiseaseNameUpdate"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/10e3af9d-80aa-4934-b592-594b1bd1cd92_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/505e82a6-f4d9-4358-9a99-1eb4aed7636c_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/505e82a6-f4d9-4358-9a99-1eb4aed7636c","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7545463","rdfs:label":"Patient 2","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f2b5d3b3-f6df-4c3f-bb7a-4b72d61f7a0d","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000313.4(PROS1):c.773A>G (p.Asn258Ser)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA123031"}},"detectionMethod":"RT-PCR of mRNA or PCR of genomic DNA amplified over the entire PROS1 gene coding region was followed by direct sequencing.","firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypeFreeText":"Mean protein S activity, free antigen, and total antigen values were 45%, 58%, and 76%, respectively for this family.","phenotypes":"obo:HP_0004936","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c33584fd-ee14-4d67-96bf-daa9699de389_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7545463","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f2b5d3b3-f6df-4c3f-bb7a-4b72d61f7a0d"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:AlleleOrigin"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"No","zygosity":{"id":"cg:MonoallelicHeterozygous"}},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:MonoallelicHeterozygous"}},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c33584fd-ee14-4d67-96bf-daa9699de389","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c33584fd-ee14-4d67-96bf-daa9699de389_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c33584fd-ee14-4d67-96bf-daa9699de389_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"The heterozygous missense variant Asn258Ser (reported by authors as Asn217Ser) occurs at a high-affinity calcium binding site.

This is consistent with humans in which heterozygous PS deficiency is milder, but is firmly associated with an increased risk of thromboembolic events. While the few homozygous and compound heterozygous patients with severe PS deficiency reported to date have life-threatening conditions such as purpura fulminans and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) in the neonatal period. Symptomatic patients can present with unprovoked thromboembolic events and are subject to recurrent events.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9bd7ef54-5b76-487e-89aa-48874f36d301","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Mean APC ratios were 1.77 (± 0.08) and 1.39 (± 0.01) for WT and Pros+/− plasmas, respectively (P = .001) and thrombin generation was reduced to 7.3% (± 0.4%) and 17.7% (± 1.5%) of basal thrombin generation for WT and Pros+/− plasmas, respectively (P < .001). This indicated that Pros+/− plasmas were significantly less responsive to wt-rmAPC than WT plasmas. Mice also exhibited a notable thrombotic phenotype in vivo when challenged in a tissue factor–induced thromboembolism model. With a lethal TF dose (2 μL/g body weight of TF diluted 1/2 in 0.9% NaCl), mice from both genotypes died within the 20-minute observation period. However, the mean time to death was 2.2 (± 0.1) minutes for Pros+/− mice (n = 12), and 4.6 (± 1.1) minutes for WT mice (n = 13; P = .047). Histologic analysis demonstrated an increased number of thrombi in the lungs of Pros+/− mice that died within the 20-minute observation period, compared with WT and Pros+/− mice that survived the challenge, consistent with a higher thrombotic potential in Pros+/− mice.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19567881","rdfs:label":"Pros+/− heterozygous mice","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":3}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":3}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":3.5}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":9789,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria7","strengthScore":15.5,"subject":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/rF-Tf6TmqJg","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0002304","gene":"hgnc:9456","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0032113"},"version":"1.1","websiteLegacyID":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/assertion_10e3af9d-80aa-4934-b592-594b1bd1cd92-","@context":{"@vocab":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"},"curationReasons":{"@type":"@vocab","@container":"@set"},"GCISnapshot":{"@type":"@id"},"dc:isVersionOf":{"@type":"@id"},"websiteLegacyID":{"@type":"@id"}}}
