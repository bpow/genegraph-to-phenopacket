This curation is considered a gene-deficiency curation, due to the lack of evidence supporting this gene being involved in any disease or disorder beyond a prolonged PTT. Evidence supporting this gene-deficiency curation includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data.  At least 6 unique variants (nonsense and frameshift) have been reported in humans.   Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 8 probands in over 8 publications.  Variants in this gene segregated with kininogen deficiency in 2 additional family members.  The gene-deficiency relationship is supported by an animal model (Merkulov et al, PMID: 18000168) and expression studies (Krijanovski et al, PMID: 12576314). In summary, KNG1 is definitively associated with (high molecular weight) kininogen deficiency. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and the clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7f97e36f-a4ab-4da6-be4f-52dce82d9e45","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6dbf4bc1-b04f-4f1d-8c11-2b7998370293","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6dbf4bc1-b04f-4f1d-8c11-2b7998370293_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2021-11-03T13:44:03.208Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6dbf4bc1-b04f-4f1d-8c11-2b7998370293_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2021-06-23T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6dbf4bc1-b04f-4f1d-8c11-2b7998370293_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6dbf4bc1-b04f-4f1d-8c11-2b7998370293_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/45c88263-4485-4b33-a03a-1688e62277bf","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The mouse model recapitulated the human phenotype of prolonged aPTT.
