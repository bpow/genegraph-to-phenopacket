{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6c698819-c96e-4227-bc38-eda6caf65279v1.1","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"The relationship between ALDH7A1 and pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy (PDE) was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of June 28th, 2019. Patients with this same condition have also been reported as having folinic acid responsive seizures (Gallagher et al, 2009, PMID 19142996). ALDH7A1 encodes alpha-aminoadipic acid semialdehyde dehydrogenase, also known as antiquitin, which converts alpha-aminoadipic acid semialdehyde (AASA) to alpha-aminoadipic acid, a critical step in lysine catabolism. Variants in ALDH7A1 causing PDE were first reported by Mills et al, 2006 (PMID 16491085). Since then, over eighty PDE-associated variants have been reported in ALDH7A1 (see Pena et al, 2017, PMID 30058881, for review). Data from 10 patients with 9 unique variants (missense, nonsense, frameshift, and splicing) from 2 publications were curated (Mills et al, 2006, PMID 16491085; Salomons et al, 2007, PMID 17721876). Additional cases are available in the literature but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. This gene-disease relationship is supported by the biochemical function of alpha-aminoadipic acid semialdehyde dehydrogenase (antiquitin), which is consistent with the biochemical and clinical features of the disease (Mills et al, 2006, PMID 16491085), expression in brain (Jansen et al, 2014; PMID 24122892), functional studies of missense variants (Coulter-Mackie et al, 2012, PMID 22784480), and the phenotype observed in two CRISPR-generated aldh7a1 zebrafish models (Pena et al, 2017; PMID 29061647; Zabinyakov et al, 2017, PMID 29053735). Additional experimental data supporting the gene-disease relationship is available but the maximum score for experimental evidence (6 points) has been reached. Data curated by Illumina is included in this curation. In summary, ALDH7A1 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive PDE. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. The classification was approved by the ClinGen Aminoacidopathy Gene Curation Expert Panel on July 26, 2019.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6c698819-c96e-4227-bc38-eda6caf65279","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7a982307-d8bd-43d1-b356-ef7ee6f32045","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7a982307-d8bd-43d1-b356-ef7ee6f32045_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10011","date":"2019-07-26T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7a982307-d8bd-43d1-b356-ef7ee6f32045_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10011","date":"2020-09-16T19:23:07.501Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7a982307-d8bd-43d1-b356-ef7ee6f32045_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f9b48d32-003e-4620-8e52-35805d018be5_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"This individual is compound heterozygous for a silent exonic change, c.834G>A (p.Val278=), which results in activation of a cryptic splice site, as shown by RT-PCR and sequencing analysis, causing deletion of the last 40 nucleotides of exon 9 leading to a frameshift leading to a premature termination codon, and a missense change, c.1432T>A (p.Cys478Ser).

Significant levels of α-AASA, P6C, and PA were found in the brain tissue from a child with pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy; these compounds were undetectable in control samples. Western blot analysis showed that antiquitin (ALDH7A1) expression was high in the cytosolic fractions of the control human cortex specimens, but very low in the PDE specimen. In control human cortex (n = 3, age 31 wk EGA - 16 years, postmortem intervals 11-31 hrs) and developing mouse brain, antiquitin immunofluorescence was identified in radial glia, mature astrocytes, ependyma, and choroid plexus epithelium. In PDE cortex, antiquitin immunofluorescence was greatly attenuated with evidence of perinuclear accumulation in astrocytes. Antiquitin immunofluorescence was never present in cells with neuronal morphology, in either control or PDE samples, and no colocalization was identified between antiquitin and the neuronal marker MAP2. These findings may help to explain the pathogenesis of structural brain abnormalities that have been reported in patients with PDE, including hypoplasia of the corpus callosum and white matter, hydrocephalus, posterior fossa abnormalities, and neuronal migration defects, as well as the frequent persistence of neurodevelopmental impairments despite control of seizures with pyridoxine treatment.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24122892","rdfs:label":"Antiquitin (ALDH7A1) expression in brain","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/24dbaa90-09d7-47be-8644-ceb985de1624","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The score is increased due to multiple piece of supporting evidence including the function of ALDH7A1, explaining the biochemical abnormalities observed in patients, and evidence for the pathogenic mechanism and responsiveness to pyridoxine.","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6bbfc760-6ff2-4890-98aa-c93f98191b4a","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Alpha-Aminoadipic-semialdehyde dehydrogenase (encoded by ALDH7A1; also known as antiquitin) catalyzes the conversion of α-aminoadipic semialdehyde (AASA) to α-aminoadipic acid. Notably, AASA is in spontaneous equilibrium with piperideine-6-carboxylic acid (P6C) (precursor is pipecolic acid). Mills et al hypothesized that P6C reacts with pyridoxyl phosphate (PLP) by Knoevenagel condensation, thereby depleting PLP levels in individuals with alpha-Aminoadipic-semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency (because they have elevated levels of P6C). This was demonstrated by tandem mass spectrometry. After incubation of P6C with PLP, two adducts appeared and the PLP signal decreased (Fig. 2). Incubation of PLP with urine from an individual with pyridoxine-dependent seizures produced identical adducts. Knoevenagel condensation of PLP and P6C is expected to inactivate PLP, reducing the function of the GABA-synthesizing enzyme GAD, which requires PLP as a cofactor. The authors propose this as the cause of the seizures, and it explains the response to pyridoxine treatment.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16491085","rdfs:label":"ALDH7A1 (antiquitin) function","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7a982307-d8bd-43d1-b356-ef7ee6f32045_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a25275ff-a968-4efa-9c48-8579f4ff5e72","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0f69d6b6-1b08-4167-934b-b11fa92e05d9","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Twelve associated missense variants in ALDH7A1, previously identified in patients with pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy, were generated by site-directed mutagenesis and expressed in E.coli.
