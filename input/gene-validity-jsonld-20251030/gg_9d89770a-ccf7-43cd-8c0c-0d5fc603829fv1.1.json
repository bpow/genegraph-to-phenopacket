There is strong evidence associating KCNE2 with acquired LQTS, however, KCNE2 variants reported for LQTS routinely require secondary provocation to induce phenotype, persuading the Expert Panel to conclude that KCNE2 has no supportive evidence as a cause of LQTS in the absence of provoking factors (PMID 28794082). \nNote: All LQTS genes were curated by 3 separate blinded teams. The evidence and scores reached by these 3 teams were reviewed by the LQTS Clinical Domain Expert Panel.
