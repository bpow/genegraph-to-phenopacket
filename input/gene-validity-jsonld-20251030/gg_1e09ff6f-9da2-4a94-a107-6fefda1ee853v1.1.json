{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1e09ff6f-9da2-4a94-a107-6fefda1ee853v1.1","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"*CIC* encodes capicua, a transcriptional repressor that plays a role in the development of the central nervous system. *CIC* was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant complex neurodevelopmental disorder in 2017 (Lu et al., PMID: 28288114). The clinical features of affected individuals are variable and include developmental delay, intellectual disability, autism or autistic features, seizures and brain MRI abnormalities.\n\nEight variants (4 frameshift, 2 nonsense, and 2 missense) that have been reported in eight probands in four publications (PMIDs: 21076407, 24307393, 28288114, 35165976) are included in this curation. Most variants are *de novo*. Two affected siblings likely inherited the variant from a parent with germline mosaicism, and in another proband the variant was inherited from an unaffected parent with low level mosaicism (PMID: 28288114). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. *CIC* is highly constrained for truncating variants but not for missense variants (gnomAD v2.1.1). The mechanism of pathogenicity is loss of function.\n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence, including conditional mouse models (PMID: 28288114) and functional alterations in patient and non-patient cells (PMIDs: 32820034, 35165976). CIC binds to the promoter of folate transport genes, including *FOLR1*; loss-of-function variants in *CIC* downregulate FOLR1 expression, leading to cerebral folate deficiency (PMID: 32820034).\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *CIC* and autosomal dominant complex neurodevelopmental disorder. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel on January 18, 2023 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1e09ff6f-9da2-4a94-a107-6fefda1ee853","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a0f9a222-8872-4054-b767-25f8fb4e404a","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a0f9a222-8872-4054-b767-25f8fb4e404a_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2025-04-20T20:46:53.972Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a0f9a222-8872-4054-b767-25f8fb4e404a_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2023-01-18T11:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a0f9a222-8872-4054-b767-25f8fb4e404a_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a0f9a222-8872-4054-b767-25f8fb4e404a_seg_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/918fde9d-73b1-402b-8cfd-a570ce68f9f7_proband_segregation","type":"FamilyCosegregation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28288114","rdfs:label":"Family 2","family":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/918fde9d-73b1-402b-8cfd-a570ce68f9f7","type":"Family","rdfs:label":"Family 2","member":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3abca694-450b-4b01-81da-fe5bf38851c3","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28288114","rdfs:label":"Lu Proband 2-1","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":27,"allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b217c67b-adbb-4a85-a41f-c5d252f3714e","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001386298.1(CIC):c.4528_4535dup (p.Glu1513ArgfsTer?)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA645373271"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"Normal brain MRI, normal muscle tone, normal deep tendon reflexes, normal gait, no ataxia","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001263","obo:HP_0001249","obo:HP_0034350","obo:HP_0001250"],"sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0b73abff-d39e-4770-a3c9-f9ddf3d2c2fd_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28288114","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b217c67b-adbb-4a85-a41f-c5d252f3714e"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:DeNovoAlleleOrigin"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:Heterozygous"}}}},"phenotypeFreeText":"Pair of siblings with developmental delay, intellectual disability and seizures.
