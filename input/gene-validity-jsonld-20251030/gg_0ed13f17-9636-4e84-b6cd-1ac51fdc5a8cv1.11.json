This association was made using case-level and experimental data. At least 10 variants (missense, nonsense, frameshift and a large deletion) have been reported in humans. PAK3 was first associated with this disease in humans as early as 1998 (Allen et al.).\nSummary of Case Level Data: 11.2 points.\nAssociation is seen in at least 10 probands in 10 publications (9731525, 10946356, 12884430, 17853471, 18523455, 24556213, 25666757, 27753653, 28481730, 28126652). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 33 additional family members. This gene-disease association is supported by expression studies, in vitro functional assays and animal models.\nIn summary, PAK3 is definitively associated with X-linked syndromic intellectual disability. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.\nThis classification was approved by the ClinGen Autism and Intellectual Disability Working Group on 7/31/2018.","*PAK3* was first reported in relation to X-linked non-syndromic intellectual disability in 1998 (Allen et al., PMID: 9731525) and was subsequently reported in individuals with intellectual disability and syndromic features, including variable dysmorphic features and brain abnormalities. *PAK3* encodes a serine/threonine protein kinase that acts as a downstream effector of the small GTPases CDC42 and RAC1. PAK3 plays a role in dendritic spine morphogenesis, synapse formation and plasticity.\n\nTen variants (missense, nonsense, frameshift and a large deletion) that have been reported in 10 probands in 10 publications (PMIDs: 9731525, 10946356, 12884430, 17853471, 18523455, 24556213, 25666757, 27753653, 28481730, 28126652) are included in this curation. Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 33 additional family members. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by *in vitro* functional assays and animal models.\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *PAK3* and X-linked syndromic intellectual disability. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Autism and Intellectual Disability Gene Curation Expert Panel on July 31, 2018 (SOP Version 5)."],"dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0ed13f17-9636-4e84-b6cd-1ac51fdc5a8c","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c2f13863-a52d-49bd-b7f6-294edd73717a","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c2f13863-a52d-49bd-b7f6-294edd73717a_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":["2018-07-30T22:00:00.000Z","2018-07-31T16:00:00.000Z"],"role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c2f13863-a52d-49bd-b7f6-294edd73717a_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2025-08-16T18:42:32.040Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"+2 more points for 90kb deletion LOF variant  (Cartwright 2017) = 16.2 points [DEFINITIVE]","curationReasons":["ErrorClarification"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c2f13863-a52d-49bd-b7f6-294edd73717a_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c2f13863-a52d-49bd-b7f6-294edd73717a_seg_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9fe47264-0ec2-4d72-b2cf-c57dd34d3298_proband_segregation","type":"FamilyCosegregation","dc:description":"The maximum possible attainable LOD score with this pedigree\nwas 2.05 and this value was reached by markers between\nDXS8077 and DXS1001, defining a single candidate region of\n26.8 cM on Xq21.3–q24.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24556213","rdfs:label":"Three-generation family","family":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9fe47264-0ec2-4d72-b2cf-c57dd34d3298","type":"Family","rdfs:label":"Three-generation family","ethnicity":{"id":"cg:UnknownEthnicity"},"member":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/23f58535-88eb-4561-843b-1396084bc733","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24556213","rdfs:label":"III-2","ageType":"AgeAtDeath","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":8,"detectionMethod":"Using theSureSelectHumanX-chromosomePanel kit byAgilent\n(Agilent Technologies) and a Illumina HiSeq2000 system (Illumina\nInc., San Diego, CA, USA), we captured and sequenced\nthe coding sequences of the proband’s non-pseudoautosomal\nX-chromosome regions.","ethnicity":{"id":"cg:UnknownEthnicity"},"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001321","obo:HP_0001250","obo:HP_0000486","obo:HP_0000455","obo:HP_0002395","obo:HP_0000252","obo:HP_0001290","obo:HP_0000212","obo:HP_0000767","obo:HP_0008064","obo:HP_0007362","obo:HP_0002280","obo:HP_0001263","obo:HP_0010554","obo:HP_0006956","obo:HP_0001488","obo:HP_0012385","obo:HP_0000218","obo:HP_0005280","obo:HP_0001274","obo:HP_0400004","obo:HP_0000286","obo:HP_0000308"],"previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"In the proband, karyotyping and 244K array-based comparative\ngenomic hybridization (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) did not reveal any chromosomal abnormalities.","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4bcd7a9c-3d04-4ad7-9c3f-13180a5d4944_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24556213","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7fe3ce7f-c946-45f3-b182-e283d9e5c23d","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NC_000023.11:g.111195898G>T","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA414238767"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"}}}},"meetsInclusionCriteria":true,"phenotypeFreeText":"","phenotypePositiveAllelePositive":5,"proband":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/23f58535-88eb-4561-843b-1396084bc733"},"publishedLodScore":2.05},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b7bbeaa1-1a06-4fb1-b150-51ae07705aa5_proband_segregation","type":"FamilyCosegregation","dc:description":"See Table I -\nXq22.3-q25 \nLOD = 3.96 \nDXS1105-DXS1059","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10946356","rdfs:label":"MRX47","family":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b7bbeaa1-1a06-4fb1-b150-51ae07705aa5","type":"Family","rdfs:label":"MRX47","ethnicity":{"id":"cg:UnknownEthnicity"},"member":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bd24c373-a881-490b-b420-41f91d2b09f7","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10946356","rdfs:label":"MRX47","ageType":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/","ageUnit":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/","detectionMethod":"We analysed 12 extended families with idiopathic\nmental retardation (10 nonspecific and two syndromal).
