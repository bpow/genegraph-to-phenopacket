Affected males present with a spectrum of phenotypes including intellectual disability, cerebellar hypoplasia, and ventriculomegaly, low muscle tone (hypotonia), developmental and cognitive delay, early-onset seizures, abnormal behavior, small or underdeveloped genitals, and characteristic facial features. Carrier females may be asymptomatic or have mild learning disabilities, cognitive impairment, strabismus, and subtle dysmorphisms (PMID: 12807966). While there are reports of phenotypic variability, the variation is thought to be a single spectrum within the same disorder and therefore variants in *OPHN1* are curated under the disease entity X-linked intellectual disability and cerebellar hypoplasia syndrome.\n \nNine variants (nonsense, missense, in-frame indel, and frameshift) that have been reported in nine probands in seven publications (PMIDs: 16221952, 16221952, 29510240, 12807966, 16158428, 25649377, 24105372) are included in this curation. Two families were included in this curation for segregation based case level evidence (PMIDs: 24105372, 29510240). Both families presented classic X-linked inheritance patterns with multiple affected males. The mechanism of pathogenicity is reported to be loss of function. \n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence. A knockout mouse model demonstrated reduced memory, reduced spatial learning, reduced dendritic spine density, and ventriculomegaly (PMID:17728457). A cellular model has also shown that *OPHN1* knockout results in decreased vesicular endocytosis at the synapses of mouse neurons (PMID:19401298). \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *OPHN1* and X-linked intellectual disability and cerebellar hypoplasia syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.This classification was approved by the Intellectual Disability and Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel on August 24, 2023 (SOP Version 9).\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/def2c2f4-9ad5-4f87-a56d-31c4be04b291","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0cb6e45b-501d-4a6f-b76b-b50d92d48f16","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0cb6e45b-501d-4a6f-b76b-b50d92d48f16_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2023-08-24T06:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0cb6e45b-501d-4a6f-b76b-b50d92d48f16_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2023-09-21T13:01:27.842Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0cb6e45b-501d-4a6f-b76b-b50d92d48f16_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c209d987-2d13-4ebc-8cdb-b4d97c7ca19a","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"0.5
