More than 1000 pathogenic variants in this gene are reported in humans, ranging from whole gene deletions, partial deletions and duplications, nonsense, frameshift and splicing variants to a number of functionally-characterized missense variants. Hemophilia A is characterized by severe bleeding diagnosed by an increased bleeding time, reduced Factor VIII activity and antigen levels. Spontaneous bleeding into joints and soft tissues is often reported. \nSummary of Case Level Data (12 points): Variants in this gene are reported in at least 14 probands in 8 publications (PMIDs: 2987704, 30210749, 3035554, 10886198, 8281136, 2105106, 16805874, 28252515). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 10 additional family members. More case-level evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence has been reached.\n\nThe mechanism for disease is hemizygous loss of function in males, with the majority of variants observed resulting in undetectable FVIII activity (PMID: 2987704). Homozygous loss of function is reported in some female patients with severe bleeding diathesis, while most females are heterozygous carriers. A proportion of patients with null variants are reported to develop antibodies to recombinant FVIII. (PMIDs: 24498605, 22102273, 20081061, 19336737).\n\nSummary of Experimental Data (4.5 points): FVIII is involved in the blood coagulation pathway and functions to activate FX by forming the tenase complex with FIX (PMID: 3286010). Hemophilia A has been studied in dogs since 1950 (PMID: 15431070, 24253479, 22137432), while horse (PMID: 6838443) and mouse models (PMID: 7647782, 24705491) also have been used extensively in Hemophilia research. These animal models have been helpful in the development of recombinant FVIII for treatment of Hemophilia A. The F8 gene disruption results in loss of function and absence of detectable FVIII:C in mice with a phenotype of severe bleeding. This is shown to be rescued by RNA trans-splicing to yield a full-length, wild-type protein in FVIII-deficient mice. Gene therapy in humans for Hemophilia A using recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV)–mediated gene transfer is at the clinical trials stage.   \nIn summary, the F8-Hemophilia A gene-disease relationship is Definitive. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/55751686-bd5e-4d43-a8f2-d7954101e3db","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d4578f11-b635-45f4-8034-310fca5fe960","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d4578f11-b635-45f4-8034-310fca5fe960_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d4578f11-b635-45f4-8034-310fca5fe960_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2019-07-24T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d4578f11-b635-45f4-8034-310fca5fe960_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d4578f11-b635-45f4-8034-310fca5fe960_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5e2d4628-a6ea-495a-ad21-d96a1e2cd474","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The model represents the first genetically engineered model for Hemophilia A.

The exons 1-22 and 23-26 are hypothesized to exist as disctinct mRNA transcripts. Exons 23-26  can be transcribed independently by a promoter located within intron 22. Lakich et al (PMID: 8275087) propose a mechanism for this inversion due to homologous recombination between the F8A (in opposite orientation to F8) gene within intron 22 and one of two regions identical to F8A located near the telomere on Xq. \n\nThis well-characterized variant is awarded increased points.","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/78b3da56-7b59-437a-8ff3-848cf6ad0c49","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8281136","rdfs:label":"Naylor_Proband","ageType":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/","ageUnit":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/","detectionMethod":"3' rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) initiated from a single factor VIII specific primer was used to amplify the unknown sequences next to exon 22. Amplified cDNA was digested with ClaI and ligated to vectorette cassettes and then amplified by a second factor VIII specific primer and vectorette primer 224. The products were sized on agarose gel, purified and sequenced. \n\nNovel sequences obtained were compared with each other, revealing organization of sequences into distinct blocks (named A to E) and sharing of these blocks among the individuals. Primers made from these novel sequences to test for inter-block amplification in genomic DNA consistently failed to amplify, with the exception of the region between C and D resulting in a 2-kb product. This implied that blocks A to E were separated by intervening sequences. This was also confirmed by Southern blot analysis and analysis of intron/exon boundaries. Translation analysis of novel exons A to E showed no continuous open reading frames. \n\nAgarose plugs from 4 individuals were digested with NruI and SfiI and probed with a section of factor VIII cDNA (exon 18 to 26) and compared to controls. A 270-kb band was observed for controls, while 2 bands of ~450 kb and ~780 kb were observed for patients. This was consistent with an inversion of the region resulting in physical separation of the two parts of factor VIII gene, with an estimation of breakpoints within intron 22 and a site ~600 kb from the telomere.","firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypeFreeText":"Severe Hemophilia","previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"RT-PCR analysis revealed mutation in intron 22 and that all 9 individuals with severe hemophilia expressed exons 23-26 as a separate transcript (F8B gene)","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/66b8c19d-11c6-4766-bc04-a0471b53baf0_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8281136","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/82c9ea4f-9081-4352-a70c-a2d865a26c56","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"F8, IVS22 INV","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/10150"}}}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/50453911-2b59-4830-8cfb-b980e3e171b8_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The missense variant is reported as the cause of Hemophilia in this large kindred.
