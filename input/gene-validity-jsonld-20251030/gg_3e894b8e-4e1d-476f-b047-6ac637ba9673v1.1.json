The *TRIM63* gene encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase and is part of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which targets cellular proteins, including sarcomeric proteins, for degradation. *TRIM63* has been associated with autosomal recessive (AR) HCM in 32 probands across 5 publications; the Q247X variant is a recurrent variant reported in 11 of these 32 probands in either a homozygous or compound heterozygous state (Olivé et al, 2015, PMID 25801283; Jokela et al, 2019, PMID 30372688; Salazar-Mendiguchía J et al, 2020, PMID 32451364; Andreeva et al, 2022, PMID 35273634; Allouba M, et al., 2023, PMID: 37431535); however, the Q247X variant has limited functional evidence for disease causation. Case-control evidence showed enrichment of biallelic TRIM63 variants in cases compared to controls, but this study did not calculate or report statistical significance (Salazar-Mendiguchía J et al, 2020, PMID 32451364). Importantly, there have been at least 2 reports of co-occurring HCM and skeletal myopathy in the presence of biallelic *TRIM63* variants (Olivé et al, 2015, PMID 25801283; Jokela et al, 2019, PMID 30372688). One of the described probands was also found to have a heterozygous TRIM54 variant. This raises the possibility of a broader phenotype including skeletal myopathy, but more evidence is needed. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by expression studies (Bodine et al, 2001, PMID 11679633; Fagerberg et al, 2014, PMID 24309898), protein interaction with TNNI3, MYBPC3, TNNT2, and MYH7 (Kedar et al, 2004, PMID 15601779, Mearini et al, 2010, PMID 19850579, Witt et al, 2005, PMID 15967462, Fielitz et al, 2007, PMID 17786241), biochemical function (Kedar et al, 2004, PMID 15601779, Mearini et al, 2010, PMID 19850579, Arya et al, 2004, PMID 15596539), and a model system (Willis et al, 2007, PMID 17272810). In summary, the evidence supporting the relationship between TRIM63 and autosomal recessive HCM is moderate.
