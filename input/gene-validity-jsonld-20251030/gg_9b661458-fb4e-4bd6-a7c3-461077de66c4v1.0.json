To date, there are three probands, two homozygous, and one compound heterozygous individuals, reported with biallelic *POLD1* missense variants and the disease. Probands displayed phenotypes including recurrent infections, decreased CD4+ T cells, and T cell lymphocytopenia. Patient P1 from Cui et al. presented with T cells showing defective S phase DNA replication and restrictive V-J gene recombinations. \n\nThis gene-disease association is also supported by one animal model (PMID:19145245). Homozygous POLD1 knock out mice were embryonic lethal by E7.5 with an apparent deficiency in cellular proliferation and DNA replication. The gene-disease association is also supported by biochemical function showing that POLD1 is the catalytic component of DNA polymerase delta, which is a critical enzyme to both DNA replication and DNA repair. Additionally, the gene-disease relationship is supported by rescue, in which transfection of WT-POLD1 was able to restore a deficiency in DNA replication seen in patient cells. Finally, a co-IP assay has shown that POLD1 co-immunoprecipitates with POLD2, which serves as the scaffolding for DNA polymerase delta and has also been implicated in non-severe combined immunodeficiency due to polymerase delta deficiency. In summary, this curation reaches a classification of Limited due to the small number of published patients. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged. This classification was approved by the ClinGen SCID-CID GCEP on the meeting date February 16th (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9b661458-fb4e-4bd6-a7c3-461077de66c4","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/73065a32-62bc-4cde-8131-f8f44c09a74f","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/73065a32-62bc-4cde-8131-f8f44c09a74f_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10081","date":"2023-02-16T18:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/73065a32-62bc-4cde-8131-f8f44c09a74f_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10081","date":"2023-03-20T21:34:54.954Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/73065a32-62bc-4cde-8131-f8f44c09a74f_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f06c0641-5f38-4dd8-a48b-68d93e0b9a69_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/642ad6f4-8ae6-4cea-86c8-db3fabd25912","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Variant is absent from gnomAD.
