Three variants (stop loss, missense) that have been reported in three probands in two publications are included in this curation. These variants segregated with disease in 7 additional family members in two families (PMIDs: 12471561, 32742378).\nThe mechanism of pathogenicity is unknown. This gene-disease association is also supported by \nexpression studies and in vitro functional assays (PMIDs: 16740909, 18448257, 24676347, 26915689). Of note, both homozygous and heterozygous CRYM null mice do not have hearing loss (PMID: 17264173). In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease\nrelationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing\nevidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the Hearing Loss GCEP on 2/16/2017. It was\nreevaluated on 9/21/2021 (SOP v8). As a result of this reevaluation, the classification did not\nchange. Although new literature was published (PMID: 32742378), the scoring still corresponded to a limited gene-disease relationship.\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/61e94f12-3ed8-4021-9805-f44310f67e23","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d15cf48a-3696-467a-b3c8-a45ef5a577bf","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d15cf48a-3696-467a-b3c8-a45ef5a577bf_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2021-09-21T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d15cf48a-3696-467a-b3c8-a45ef5a577bf_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2021-12-02T18:54:22.023Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d15cf48a-3696-467a-b3c8-a45ef5a577bf_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6aa3bb82-858c-4736-96c4-39653f5d6105","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"De novo variants are not additionally convincing or suspicious in the hearing loss field.
