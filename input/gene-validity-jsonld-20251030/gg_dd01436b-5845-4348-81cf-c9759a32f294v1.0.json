A nonsense variant that has been reported in a proband in 1 publication is included in this curation (PMID: 24482543). The variant segregated with disease in 7 additional family members. The mechanism of pathogenicity is unknown. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by an expression study and a zebrafish model (PMID: 24482543). In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the ClinGen Hearing Loss GCEP on 05/10/2017 as per SOP v4. It was reevaluated on 10/31/2024 using SOP v11. As a result of this reevaluation, this record underwent an update in scoring to be consistent with SOP v11. There has been no new evidence published since the last curation.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/dd01436b-5845-4348-81cf-c9759a32f294","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8dc7be09-eeed-4bd3-8a00-ab4e89af3bae","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8dc7be09-eeed-4bd3-8a00-ab4e89af3bae_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2024-10-31T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8dc7be09-eeed-4bd3-8a00-ab4e89af3bae_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2024-11-13T14:02:52.437Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["RecurationTiming"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8dc7be09-eeed-4bd3-8a00-ab4e89af3bae_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/03b1795d-7a28-459e-957f-ef87f655931f_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1792a902-7bf2-49ed-a235-6f01141f1bb2","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Downgraded 0.5 pt each for consanguinity and homozygosity","calculatedScore":4,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1792a902-7bf2-49ed-a235-6f01141f1bb2_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"COS-7 cells were transfected with GFP-tagged ADCY1 constructs.
