So far, there is only one missense variant has been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This gene-disease relationship is supported by protein expression A that the PTGS1 protein is preferentially expressed constitutively at high levels in selected cells, including endothelium, monocytes, platelets, renal collecting tubules, and seminal vesicles [PMID: 18657230], protein expression B that  the authors showed that the COX-1 protein in platelet lysates from the proband and her homozygous relatives was absent. [PMID: 32299908],  and homozygous mutant mice showed reduced platelet aggregation, which was similar to the phenotypes observed in the individuals carrying the homozygous PGTS1 variant [PMID: 8521478]. In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/daf13322-a6f8-4775-ab56-989e9accec63","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/24dc7cc9-f3f6-421e-ad78-016e89e6220b","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/24dc7cc9-f3f6-421e-ad78-016e89e6220b_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2022-03-24T17:14:02.466Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/24dc7cc9-f3f6-421e-ad78-016e89e6220b_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2022-03-24T17:13:50.179Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/24dc7cc9-f3f6-421e-ad78-016e89e6220b_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/18c8ee87-6aa5-4c71-b3bd-8799558d4eb6_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2f3bd130-f2a2-442b-b770-e44eb2abaf23","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Western blotting and confocal imaging demonstrated that COX-1 was absent in the platelets of three family members homozygous for the PTGS1 variant but present in their leukocytes.
