The affected individuals, including both males and females, typically have intellectual disability with variable seizures, autistic traits, and psychiatric problems. Males are generally more severely affected compared with females. Eight variants (nonsense and frameshift variants) were curated from one publication with a large patient cohort (PMID:30206421). To date, at least 70 variants in IQSEC2 have been reported in patients (PMID:30328660) and 47 unique variants with IQSEC2 have been classified as Pathogenic in ClinVar. In regard to experimental data, this gene-disease relationship is supported by expression studies, non-human model organisms, and cell culture models. In summary, IQSEC2 is definitively associated with x-linked complex neurodevelopmental disorder. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel on 6/5/19 (SOP Version 6).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b7d7ee93-2e1e-46cd-a2de-208bd34111b6","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0916cda1-5213-4f88-9835-34c3931526a2","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0916cda1-5213-4f88-9835-34c3931526a2_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2019-06-05T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0916cda1-5213-4f88-9835-34c3931526a2_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2021-10-27T13:46:06.641Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0916cda1-5213-4f88-9835-34c3931526a2_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ffbe8c48-e155-42f3-bbac-e3943bdd376e","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ffbe8c48-e155-42f3-bbac-e3943bdd376e_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30206421","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/79f179e3-cadf-485e-9f4b-66738b0d35b1","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001111125.3(IQSEC2):c.2854C>T
