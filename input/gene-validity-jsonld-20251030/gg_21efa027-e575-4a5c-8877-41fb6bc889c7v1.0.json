Dysfunctional endo-lysosomal and autophagic trafficking, leading to impaired proteostasis is common across the FTD-ALS spectrum. These pathways are, in part, mediated by CHMP2B, a protein that coordinates membrane scission events as a core component of the ESCRT machinery. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. At least 10 rare variants have been reported in relation to FTD-ALS (both truncating and missense variants). Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 13 probands in 10 publications (PMIDs: 16041373, 16807408, 17956895, 20352044, 23155438, 29411640, 29895397, 33770234, 23881933, 26777436), and segregated with disease in at least 10 additional family members in a Danish FTD pedigree (PMID: 16041373). The preponderance of evidence supporting a gene-disease relationship for *CHMP2B* relates to the CHMP2Bintron5 variant identified in the Danish FTD pedigree (PMID: 16041373), with a small number of variants also reported in ALS patients.  Experimentally, this gene-disease relationship is supported by functional alteration, observed in both patient and transfected cells, causing an abnormal endosomal phenotype and neurodegeneration associated with the autophagy pathway (PMIDs: 22786763, 17683935) which could be rescued in patient cells by CRISPR/Cas-9 mediated correction of the variant (PMID: 28216144). Additionally, there are multiple mouse models recapitulating disease (PMIDs: 27329763, 34130995). In summary, *CHMP2B* is definitively associated with autosomal dominant frontotemporal dementia and/or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 7. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen ALS GCEP on 07/12/2022 (SOPv8).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/21efa027-e575-4a5c-8877-41fb6bc889c7","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/287cab44-b8b6-411c-903a-6214ac5e98af","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/287cab44-b8b6-411c-903a-6214ac5e98af_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10096","date":"2022-07-12T19:22:40.320Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/287cab44-b8b6-411c-903a-6214ac5e98af_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10096","date":"2022-07-12T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/287cab44-b8b6-411c-903a-6214ac5e98af_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/14a514e0-6729-4ad8-a776-55b305d565a6","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Functional data was not considered here because similar results can be obtained from variants that are not considered pathogenic.","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/14a514e0-6729-4ad8-a776-55b305d565a6_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"Transfection of myc-tagged full-length variant into HEK293 cells produced aberrant phenotypes of large cytoplasmic vacuoles and the presence of vacuoles with an accumulation of CHMP2B mutant protein on the outer membrane.
