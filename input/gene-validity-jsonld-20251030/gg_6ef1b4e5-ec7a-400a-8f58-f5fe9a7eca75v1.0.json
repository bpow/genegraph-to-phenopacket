As consequence of these biochemical abnormalities the clinical signs and symptoms reflect a combination of energy deficiency and endogenous toxicity. A lack of energy affects fatty acid dependent tissues (heart, skeletal muscle and liver) leading to cardiomyopathies and liver dysfunction, while hypoketosis, hyperammonemia and severe hypoglycemia result in neurological dysfunction increased levels of acylcarnitines are toxic for muscle function and heart contributing to damage of heart and skeletal muscle.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9731180","rdfs:label":"Indiveri1998","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0240f8bf-e9c2-4cea-9e3c-af6c9926a279","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Northern blotting revealed high levels of transcripts in heart, skeletal muscle, and liver tissues, which is in fair agreement with the clinical involvement of these tissues in the patient.
