The *GSTZ1* gene encodes an enzyme that is involved in the phenylalanine/phenylacetate degradation pathway. Most patients with the deﬁciency show only mild symptoms and remain well without treatment (Yang et al., 2017; PMID 27876694). Five variants (missense, nonsense, and intronic) that have been reported in seven probands in two publications (PMIDs: 27876694, 38535121) are included in this curation. This gene-disease association is also supported by biochemical assays and a mouse model (PMIDs: 12052898, 9417084). In summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged. \n\nThis gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the ClinGen Aminoacidopathy Gene Curation Expert Panel on March 22nd, 2019. It was reevaluated on September 9th, 2022, and on December 5th, 2024. As a result of this reevaluation, new genetic evidence was added (PMID: 38535121) but the classification did not change.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/46b327a6-7da0-4c6d-9bdc-6522fee4a9a0","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8c287e0b-88be-4fbb-82a6-a8c70d430506","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","changes":[{"id":"cg:sopChange"},{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"},{"id":"cg:newEvidence"},{"id":"cg:summaryChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8c287e0b-88be-4fbb-82a6-a8c70d430506_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10011","date":"2024-12-13T17:59:45.440Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8c287e0b-88be-4fbb-82a6-a8c70d430506_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10011","date":"2024-12-13T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["RecurationTiming","RecurationNewEvidence"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8c287e0b-88be-4fbb-82a6-a8c70d430506_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8c287e0b-88be-4fbb-82a6-a8c70d430506_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/65d6a5c3-e4ba-4aeb-b30c-99c9c0b2b48e","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a4bfd235-a729-42cb-9071-f48b65244567","type":"Finding","dc:description":"The phenylalanine/tyrosine degradation pathway consists of 6 sequential enzyme reactions.

Segregation analysis revealed heterozygosity for this variant in the mother and homozygosity in his father. The 32-year-old father had no medical concerns up to that point and the laboratory work-up was unremarkable; succinylacetone in DBS was within reference range (0.98 µmol/L, N < 1.59), and urinary succinylacetone was undetectable.\n\ngnomADv4 Grpmax Filtering AF 2.800e-7","calculatedScore":3.0,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/477db4cd-f8ac-4289-9cdd-0911150fd45f_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/477db4cd-f8ac-4289-9cdd-0911150fd45f_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"The canonical splice acceptor site variant is predicted to cause skipping of exon 4, causing an in frame deletion p.Phe46_Ser72del that removes 12% of the protein.
