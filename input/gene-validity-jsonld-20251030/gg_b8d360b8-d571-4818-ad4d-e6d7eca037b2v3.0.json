Four variants (missense, frameshift) that have been reported in 4 probands in 4 publications (PMIDs: 17503326, 34416374, 33229591, 37165931) are included in this curation. Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 14 additional family members (PMID:17503326). The mechanism of pathogenicity is unknown. This gene-disease association is also supported by an expression study (PMID:17503326). A knockdown mouse model showed no difference in auditory brainstem response thresholds between mutants and controls, so it was not scored (PMID: 37165931). In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the ClinGen Hearing Loss GCEP on 12/15/2017 as per SOP v6. It was reevaluated on 6/25/2024 using SOP v10. As a result of this reevaluation, this record underwent an update in scoring to be consistent with SOP v10. New case level and functional evidence has been reviewed or added, but the classification did not change (PMIDs: 34416374, 33229591, 37165931). \n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b8d360b8-d571-4818-ad4d-e6d7eca037b2","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cf656dcb-6644-41bb-a29a-d7bdf54b28f7","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","changes":[{"id":"cg:newEvidence"},{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"},{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},{"id":"cg:sopChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cf656dcb-6644-41bb-a29a-d7bdf54b28f7_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2024-06-25T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cf656dcb-6644-41bb-a29a-d7bdf54b28f7_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2024-08-07T15:44:51.523Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["RecurationCommunityRequest"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cf656dcb-6644-41bb-a29a-d7bdf54b28f7_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cf656dcb-6644-41bb-a29a-d7bdf54b28f7_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a0d36db7-5ae4-4b37-94f0-3af67f266022","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cf802ee4-8c06-4b89-b91e-3627c914fec7","type":"Finding","dc:description":"RT-PCR on mouse cochlea mRNA revealed CCDC50 expression in the mouse inner ear prenatally, at birth, and 14 days postnatal.
