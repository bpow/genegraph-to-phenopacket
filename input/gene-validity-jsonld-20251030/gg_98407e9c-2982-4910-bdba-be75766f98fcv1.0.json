(2002). Multiple case level studies have been performed with medulloblastoma patients that have variants in the SUFU gene. PTCH1 and PTCH2 are also related to dominantly inherited NBCCS and medulloblastoma. The effect of medulloblastoma-derived mutant of SUFU on Hedgehog signaling activity had been shown in cell assays. Multiple SUFU deficient mouse models have been established to show consistent phenotypes with medulloblastoma patients. Sufu+/- mice develop a Gorlin-like skin phenotype. Patients with SUFU mutations can exhibit medulloblastoma and features of Gorlin syndrome. In conjunction with p53 loss, Sufu+/-\u0002 mice developed tumors including medulloblastoma and rhabdomyosarcoma. All of these types of evidence are consistent with a definitive relationship between the SUFU gene and medulloblastoma.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/98407e9c-2982-4910-bdba-be75766f98fc","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1408d8b1-015c-48b3-a28e-d99b5545fce8","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1408d8b1-015c-48b3-a28e-d99b5545fce8_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10023","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1408d8b1-015c-48b3-a28e-d99b5545fce8_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10023","date":"2018-10-11T18:42:15.077Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1408d8b1-015c-48b3-a28e-d99b5545fce8_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1408d8b1-015c-48b3-a28e-d99b5545fce8_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b20797c0-a210-49cf-87f7-0ddf18152506","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Reduce points is because no development of tumors were found in the Sufu deficient mice.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/398198ef-25e5-41ac-803d-42b699033c16","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Sufu-/- Embryos Die In Utero at wE9.5, and the Neural Tube and Cephalic Vesicles Fail to Completely Close.
