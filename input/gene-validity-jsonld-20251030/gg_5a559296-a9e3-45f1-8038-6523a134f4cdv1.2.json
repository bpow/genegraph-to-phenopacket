This inherited disorder is caused by variants that decrease or abolish the expression or function of the MOGS enzyme, which normally functions in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to catalyze a cleavage step in the processing of oligosaccharides for N-linked attachment to nascent glycoproteins. MOGS loss-of-function results in the accumulation of abnormal N-linked glycoproteins and oligosaccharides, as well as ER stress. These molecular events trigger a variety of phenotypes in affected individuals that span a range of categories from morphological to neuromuscular and immunological ((PMID: 24716661). This curation includes fifteen variants (ten missense, four nonsense, and one single amino acid deletion) from nine probands reported in eight publications (PMID:32246563, PMID:10788335, PMID:24716661, PMID:29235540, PMID:30587846, PMID:31925597, PMID:33058492, and PMID:33261925). Two of the nonsense variants and the single amino acid deletion have been found to recur in multiple probands (PMID:32246563, PMID:33261925, PMID:29235540). The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be biallelic loss of function. All genotyped patients were compound heterozygotes within the MOGS locus. This gene-disease association is supported by experimental evidence showing that the function of the MOGS enzyme is consistent with disease phenotypes (PMID:7635146) which is disrupted in patient cells (PMID:12145188) and non-patient cells (PMID: 15383536). Experimental evidence also includes C. elegans and S. pombe models that disrupt orthologs of MOGS and recapitulate some of the features of the affected patients (PMID:23836288, PMID:30389790). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for functional evidence (6 points) has been reached. In summary, MOGS is definitively associated with autosomal recessive MOGS-CDG. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both research and diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time without emergence of contradictory evidence.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5a559296-a9e3-45f1-8038-6523a134f4cd","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5a628248-c2f9-4d31-b614-e082e3f83416","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5a628248-c2f9-4d31-b614-e082e3f83416_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10097","date":"2024-11-20T20:35:00.566Z","role":"Publisher"},{"agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10080","role":"SecondaryContributor"},{"agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10095","role":"SecondaryContributor"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5a628248-c2f9-4d31-b614-e082e3f83416_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10097","date":"2021-07-20T13:07:42.194Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["ErrorClarification"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5a628248-c2f9-4d31-b614-e082e3f83416_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/69a7c29e-73d5-4767-8fb1-732b4eb17a99_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Compound heterozygous missense variants Arg486Thr and Phe652Leu, located in exon four (which encodes the catalytic domain), were identified in a patient with severely decreased protein levels and glucosidase I activity less than 3% of control levels.
