Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, there was no evidence of differences in their inheritance pattern or phenotypic spectrum. Therefore, the following disease entities have been lumped into one disease entity: congenital hypoaldosteronism due to CMO I deficiency (OMIM:203400) and congenital hypoaldosteronism due to CMO II deficiency (OMIM:610600). The preferred disease name suggested for this grouping of disorders is ‘familial hyperreninemic hypoaldosteronism - *CYP11B2*’.\n\n*CYP11B2* was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive familial hyperreninemic hypoaldosteronism in 1992 (Pascoe et al., PMID: 1594605). The mechanism of pathogenicity is known to be loss of function. Familial hyperreninemic hypoaldosteronism typically presents in infancy as a life-threatening electrolyte imbalance, characterized by failure to thrive, recurrent vomiting, and severe dehydration. A history of diarrhea, lethargy, poor weight gain, and poor feeding since birth may also be present. \n\nAt least 9 variants (missense, in-frame indel, nonsense, frameshift, canonical splice site) have been reported in 5 probands in 5 publications (PMIDs: 12788848, 23018980, 31302112, 32539318, 34243750 included in this curation). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached, considering case-level data.\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by expression studies and biochemical function. CYP11B2 is expressed in the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal glands and is used to synthesize aldosterone, with biallelic variation leading to aldosterone deficiency causing disease (PMIDs: 20200334, 21237269). A total of 1/6 pts. for experimental evidence was reached.\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *CYP11B2* and autosomal recessive familial hyperreninemic hypoaldosteronism. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3718a298-0d18-4471-9b78-f09ef851cea3","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a81c6c87-34bc-4ec4-8c31-91d2c9be4095","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a81c6c87-34bc-4ec4-8c31-91d2c9be4095_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10067","date":"2023-11-16T01:30:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a81c6c87-34bc-4ec4-8c31-91d2c9be4095_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10067","date":"2024-01-09T05:14:43.974Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a81c6c87-34bc-4ec4-8c31-91d2c9be4095_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a81c6c87-34bc-4ec4-8c31-91d2c9be4095_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/390eb401-e20b-432b-9717-009c096d8d42","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/304968a9-28f6-4845-a5ed-e70c4bf862ae","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Due to CYP11B2 deficiency, biosynthesis of aldosterone is depleted/abolished.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21237269","rdfs:label":"Aldosterone synthase activity","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1f811fbd-b91f-4e3f-be4a-f6cb4de30aab","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cd2e1840-d582-4d09-a1a1-49643bb48e93","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Expressed sporadically in the zona glomerulosa (zG) of the adrenal cortex (conventional zonation), as well as in aldosterone-producing cell clusters (APCCs) composed of morphological zG cells in contact with the capsule (variegated zonation).

HEK-293T cell line lacks steroidogenic enzyme expression and is suitable for testing enzyme activities. After 24 h incubation with DOC, HEK-293T cells transfected with WT CYP11B2 converted nearly all substrate to 18-hydroxycorticosterone and aldosterone. In contrast, products from cells expressing the variant p.Leu464del and p.Arg432Glyfs*37 were not detected, consistent with ASD type 1.","functionalDataSupport":"Yes"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/27461b26-3cbe-4cca-8abc-381c1b40ddb7_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31302112","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9f81deab-885a-4692-8606-7315478fec2c","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000498.3(CYP11B2):c.1294del (p.Arg432GlyfsTer?)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA2695196486"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d24ae146-81c5-4882-9408-7f0d93ebeea3","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31302112","rdfs:label":"Miao Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":11,"allele":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/890617b0-ab1a-4af9-8054-2a3d0c29f0d5"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9f81deab-885a-4692-8606-7315478fec2c"}],"firstTestingMethod":"Next generation sequencing panels","phenotypeFreeText":"ASD 1.\nDOC and corticosterone were increased, while the 18OH-corticosterone was in normal range.","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0004325","obo:HP_0002902","obo:HP_0004322","obo:HP_0001508","obo:HP_0001944","obo:HP_0040085","obo:HP_0002013","obo:HP_0003351","obo:HP_0011968"],"sex":"Male","variant":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/27461b26-3cbe-4cca-8abc-381c1b40ddb7_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/03391565-760f-455e-b322-7f1e075009a8_variant_evidence_item"}]}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria","strengthScore":2.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8a867ff4-3bbf-4a41-a7de-b9c4f4e6c41c_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/60678104-1274-416e-aa81-5e4f981574d2","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/60678104-1274-416e-aa81-5e4f981574d2_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23018980","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bbfcd1f1-5265-4934-8d4f-f4d08c5f865e","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000498.3(CYP11B2):c.1150C>T (p.Arg384Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA4905909"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/dc2db7e9-9cd6-4981-8be8-cfe470ae455a","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/dc2db7e9-9cd6-4981-8be8-cfe470ae455a_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23018980","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/885b8497-b871-417b-8291-58872f7e870c","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000498.3(CYP11B2):c.168G>A (p.Trp56Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA372393580"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8a867ff4-3bbf-4a41-a7de-b9c4f4e6c41c","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23018980","rdfs:label":"Kondo Proband","allele":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/885b8497-b871-417b-8291-58872f7e870c"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bbfcd1f1-5265-4934-8d4f-f4d08c5f865e"}],"detectionMethod":"Direct sequencing using PCR","firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypeFreeText":"Aldosterone synthase deficiency type 1.
