Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found differences in molecular mechanisms and phenotypic variability, resulting in our assessment of gene-disease relationship being split into two disease entities; supravalvular aortic stenosis (MONDO:0008504) and autosomal dominant cutis laxa 1 (MONDO:0007411). This split curation focuses on *ELN­*-related ADCL. The relationship of *ELN* and SVAS will be assessed separately in the Congenital Heart Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel.\n\n*ELN* was reported in relation to ADCL as early as 1998 (Tassabehji et. al. 1998, PMID 9580666). Patients with *ELN*-related cutis laxa present with loose, hyperextensible skin, premature aged appearance, and distinctive facial features (i.e. large ears, convex nasal ridge, long philtrum). Some patients also exhibit symptoms of joint hyperlaxity, inguinal hernia, ptosis, emphysema, and aortic root dilatation or aneurysm. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data. Numerous *ELN* variants (e.g. intronic, missense, nonsense, frameshift) have been reported in patients with ADCL, the majority of which are heterozygous frameshift variants located within the 3’ region of the elastin gene (PMID: 29501665). Variants in this gene have been reported in at least twenty-two probands, thirteen of whom are *de novo*, in eleven publications (PMID: 9580666, 9873040, 15381555, 16085695, 21309044, 23442826, 24758204, 26121527, 28383366, 36002914, 38445193). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in an autosomal dominant manner in twelve additional family members (PMID: 16085695, 23442826).\n\nA subset of ADCL patients exhibiting aortic root dilatation or aneurysm (PMID: 36173875) were reported to be caused by heterozygous frameshift variants located in exons 30 to 34 of *ELN*. Two mutational hotspots, NM_000501.4:c.1973del (published as c.2039delC, c.2158delC, or c.2159delC in exon 30), and NM_000501.4:c.2058del (published as c.2262delA in exon 32) have been repeatedly reported in both familial and sporadic cases of ADCL with varying severity of aortic aneurysm disease including dissection in one patient (PMID: 9873040, 16085695, 23442826).\n\nFurthermore, this gene-disease relationship is supported by animal models, expression studies, in vitro functional assays (PMID: 16085695, 20600892, 21309044, 22573328). Expression studies of patient fibroblast cultures show frameshift variants situated within the 3’ end of the ELN gene to produce a stable mutant mRNA isoform via alternate splicing, whereby the C-terminus of tropoelastin is replaced with a missense sequence with read-through into the 3’ UTR leading to an extended peptide sequence (PMID: 16085695, 21309044). Callewaert with colleagues showed C-terminal frameshift variants in *ELN* to result in enhanced globule formation, increased TGFβ signaling and mutation-specific differences in endoplasmic reticulum stress and apoptosis (PMID: 16085695). Inclusion of mutant elastin and normal elastin results in a copolymer that causes reduced and scattered globule deposition on microfibrils. Hence, the variants act through a dominant negative mechanism as maturation of tropoelastin into insoluble elastin is impaired (PMID: 16085695, 20600892, 21309044). Analysis of tissues from mice expressing the hBACCL transgene (generated with *ELN* variant NM_000501.4:c.1946del) found that the mutant protein is incorporated into elastic fibers of skin and lung with adverse effects, but is not well incorporated in the aorta (PMID: 22573328). Another study involving the overexpression of an *ELN* frameshift variant (NM_000501.4:c.1928_1952del) on the normal murine background produced varying pulmonary phenotypes, similar to those observed in some human patients with ADCL, along with overall significant mortality in the transgenic mice; however, no abnormalities of mutant protein expression were observed in the skin and blood vessel (PMID: 20600892).\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between *ELN* and autosomal dominant cutis laxa. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. The mechanism for disease is heterozygous gain of function, dominant-negative effect from a stable C-terminally extended mutant isoform of the elastin protein (PMID: 16085695). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence and/or experimental evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. This classification was approved by the Heritable Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm and Dissection subgroup of the Hereditary Cardiovascular Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on the meeting date October 4th, 2024 (Gene-Disease Validity SOP, version 11).\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2065eee8-42dc-4460-8f20-da368b7f4c86","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6bfdc253-320e-4c03-959f-57348fe403fd","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6bfdc253-320e-4c03-959f-57348fe403fd_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10104","date":"2024-11-20T16:20:44.308Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6bfdc253-320e-4c03-959f-57348fe403fd_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10104","date":"2024-10-04T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6bfdc253-320e-4c03-959f-57348fe403fd_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f076f1ed-3884-449b-bdae-fdd1367afe00","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"This variant is a mutational hotspot.","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f076f1ed-3884-449b-bdae-fdd1367afe00_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23442826","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/89f0e108-9612-40a8-9eb9-d559e151bc49","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000501.4(ELN):c.2058del (p.Gly688ValfsTer?)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA10588435"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:Heterozygous"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":0.1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ca78a24c-46e4-46e3-b57a-cf6cf1ed856c","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Score upgraded.
