This association was made using case-level and experimental data. Only a few pathogenic variants in this gene are reported in ClinVar, including frameshift, missense and splicing variants. F13B encodes the B subunits, which act as carrier proteins, of the coagulation factor XIII. FXIII is a transglutaminase that forms intramolecular gamma-glutamyl-epsilon-lysine crosslinking between fibrin molecules to stabilize blood clots. Factor XIIIB deficiency is characterized by a bleeding diathesis, poor wound healing and reduced Factor XIII activity and antigen levels. Mutations in F13B were first associated with this disease in humans as early as 1993 by Hashiguchi et al. (PMID: 8324218).\n\nSummary of Case Level Data (10 points): The association is seen in at least 6 probands in 5 publications (PMID: 11313256, 20331752, 8324218, 8639893, 31064749). \n\nThe mechanism for disease is expected to be biallelic loss of function. A number of heterozygous individuals with Factor XIIIB deficiency have also been reported, but have not been scored in this curation (PMID: 20331752, 23913518, 26247044). \n\nSummary of Experimental Data (2.5 points): A mouse model recapitulating FXIII deficiency and rescue using rFXIIIB have been reported (PMID: 18224415).  \n\nIn summary, the F13B - Factor XIIIB deficiency gene-disease relationship is definitive. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hemostasis/Thrombosis GCEP on July 22, 2020.

It os reported in gnomAD at a frequency of 0.00005453 in East Asians and a total frequency of 0.000004028, with no homozygotes.\n\nThe consequence of the delG variant in this proband was evaluated by expression studies. A ful-length cDNA of XIIIB cleaved from an expression vector (ZMB3/rXIIIb) was subcloned into the EcoRI site of pBluescript II (pBSII/WT rXIIIB). A fragment of exon 9, containing the delG variant was amplified and inserted into the RsaI-BsgI site of pBSII/WT rXIIIB (pBSII/Mut rXIIIB), which was subsequently ligated to the ZMB3 expression vector. The wild type and variant recombinant FXIIIs were used to transfect baby hamster kidney cells. Immunoprecipitation showed a 80 kd WT-rXIIIB and a 60-kd truncated rXIIIB in the lysates. No dimer was observed for the variant rXIIIB under nonreducing conditions.\n\nPulse-chase experiments using S-35 labeled methionine and rabbit antihuman XIIIB antibody were performed. WT-rXIIIB was secreted out of the cell immediately, with all of the labeled rXIIIB in the medium in 2 hours. The variant XIIIB was not secreted and decreased to 50% after 2 hours.\n\nImmunocytochemistry using rabbit antihuman XIIIB antibody and FITC-conjugated goat antirabbit IgG on the supernatant of the culture was also performed. Staining was repeated with mouse monoclonal antibody against Golgi 58K protein (Golgi marker) or protein disulfide isomerase (PDI, ER marker) and rhodamin-conjugated antimouse IgG. Intense signals for the wild-type rXIIIB were observed, which colocalized with Golgi 58K protein, while the variant rXIIIB colocalized with the ER marker, PDI.\n\nThe cell suspension was treated similar to immunocytochemistry for electron microscopy, which showed accumulation of WT-XIIIB in the Golgi and variant rXIIIB in the rough ER.\n\nThe authors conclude that the delG variant may cause ER retention and affect the secretion of FXIIIB outside the cell. Some conformational change, in the eighth Sushi domain is expected because the variant causes truncation in the middle of the domain and extends the length of 10 entirely new amino acids.\n\nThe reduction in FXIIIA levels in this proband, although there were no variants in the FXIIIA gene, must be secondary to the lack of FXIIIA.\n\nThe proband is scored 0 points since the parents of the proband have not been tested and the variants have not been confirmed to be in trans.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/71eea28c-3397-495f-a0c7-528d240c4454","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11313256","rdfs:label":"Koseki_Patient4","ageType":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/","ageUnit":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/","detectionMethod":"PCR-RFLP using Taq1 was performed to detect the c.65-2del variant as it creates a Taq1 recognition site.
