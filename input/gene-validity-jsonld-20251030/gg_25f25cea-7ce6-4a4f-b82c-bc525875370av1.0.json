At least 14 unique variants (missense, nonsense, frameshift) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data.  Summary of case-level and experimental data: 14.5 points. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 10 probands in 9 publications (PMIDs: 30396834, 11992265, 24553428, 23181892, 11743515, 20673864, 9345094, 9482850, 9915948). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence  (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism for disease is loss of function. This gene-disease association is supported by animal models and functional assays. In summary, HSD17B4 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive d-bifunctional protein deficiency. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no\ndifference in molecular mechanism, inheritance pattern, and phenotypic\nvariability among the following disease entities: (1) D-bifunctional protein deficiency (MIM: 261515) and (2) Perrault syndrome 1 (MIM: 233400). Therefore, all of the disease entities have been lumped into one disease entity, d-bifunctional protein deficiency.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/25f25cea-7ce6-4a4f-b82c-bc525875370a","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b992de69-49b3-496d-a83a-5bcc427fdf98","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b992de69-49b3-496d-a83a-5bcc427fdf98_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10049","date":"2020-04-17T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b992de69-49b3-496d-a83a-5bcc427fdf98_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10049","date":"2021-07-30T16:16:05.235Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b992de69-49b3-496d-a83a-5bcc427fdf98_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/53fec4b1-4e08-4363-898e-700220ee8071_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Scored as zero due to lack of evidence for variants being in trans","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a7260756-f497-497a-b0e4-d1f07f00018a","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30396834","rdfs:label":"Farkas Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":6,"detectionMethod":"WES","firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"difficulty performing simple tasks and following directions, head CT showed symmetric cerebral white matter and thalamic hypodensity.
