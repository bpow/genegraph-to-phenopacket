Three missense variants in four probands from three publications (PMIDs: 10053006, 10377013, 25119967) are included in this curation. Additional probands reported to be diagnosed with SADDAN syndrome exist in the literature, but they were not scored in this curation due to difficulty in diagnosing developmental delay and acanthosis nigricans before a certain age. The mechanism of\npathogenicity is GOF. A case report showing a GOF missense varaint K650M in cis with a LOF variant T651P leads to comparatively mild skeletal phenotype in the proband (PMID: 24352917).  This gene-disease relationship is also supported by an animal model and in vitro functional assays (PMIDs: 11406607, 19088846, 29242050, 15292251, 16476447). In summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Skeletal Disorders Gene Curation Expert Panel on the meeting date 5/9/22 (SOP Version 8).","FGFR3 was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant severe achondroplasia-developmental delay-acanthosis nigricans (SADDAN) syndrome in in 1999 (Tavormina et al. 1999; PMID: 10053006). Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found differences in phenotypic variability. Therefore, the following disease entities have been split into multiple disease entities, SADDAN (OMIM:616482), Hypochondroplasia (OMIM:146000), Achondroplasia (OMIM: 100800), *FGFR3*-related Thanatophoric Dysplasia (Type I OMIM:187600 and Type II OMIM:187601), Crouzon Syndrome with acanthosis nigricans (OMIM:612247), Muenke Syndrome (OMIM:602849), and CATSHL Syndrome (OMIM:610474). The split curations for these gene disease relationships have been curated separately. Three missense variants in four probands from three publications (PMIDs: 10053006, 10377013, 25119967) are included in this curation.
