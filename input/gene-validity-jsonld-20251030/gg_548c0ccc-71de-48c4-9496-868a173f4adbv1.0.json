One of the papers included 3 individuals with heterozygous p.Arg535Cys (PMID: 31006513), confirmed to be de novo in 2 individuals. One of these individuals was not scored due to a lack of documentation of holoprosencephaly. The other paper included 2 individuals with de novo p.Arg535Cys, both of whom with holoprosencephaly. A knock-in mouse model of this variant showed neurological and pancreatic abnormalities at E14.5, and this evidence was used to augment the genetic evidence. A mouse brain expression study (PMID: 31006510) was scored as functional evidence. In total, there is Limited evidence to support the gene-disease relationship between *CNOT1* and holoprosencephaly with or without pancreatic agenesis. Of note, this gene has also been implicated in Vissers-Bodmer syndrome, which is characterized by global developmental delay and behavioral abnormalities apparent from infancy. As the condition is clinically distinct from holoprosencephaly and/or pancreatic agenesis/insufficiency, lacks specific structural brain anomalies, and likely has different molecular mechanisms, this will be/have been assessed separately. This curation was approved by the Brain Malformation Panel on 2/14/2023.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/548c0ccc-71de-48c4-9496-868a173f4adb","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/91d394c9-60fe-40cb-918b-9790a08873d9","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/91d394c9-60fe-40cb-918b-9790a08873d9_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10020","date":"2023-09-30T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/91d394c9-60fe-40cb-918b-9790a08873d9_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10020","date":"2023-10-02T16:04:33.636Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/91d394c9-60fe-40cb-918b-9790a08873d9_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d83dbb7d-2e9c-49f0-97ab-68505822ec7c","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d83dbb7d-2e9c-49f0-97ab-68505822ec7c_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"Mouse
