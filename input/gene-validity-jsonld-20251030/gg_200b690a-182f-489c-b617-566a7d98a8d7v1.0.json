Dominant negative mutations in the TOP2B gene, encoding DNA topoisomerase 2-beta, cause Hoffman syndrome (also known as BILU syndrome) with humoral b-cell immunodeficiency, distal limb anomalies, dysmorphic facial features, and urogenital malformations. Three missense variants and one in-frame deletion in the TOPRIM domain have been reported in six probands, and three additional family members, in three publications (PMIDs: 31409799, 32128574, and 33459963). This gene-disease association is supported by its function, generating transient double-stranded DNA breaks that alleviate negative supercoils (PMID: 10684600). Failure to relax topological stress in patient cells (PMID: 32128574) can reduce the production of multiple gene products, and cause loss of function of large genes, which are most vulnerable to topologic stress. Many B-cell-specific transcription factor genes are relatively long and require TOP2B for efficient transcription, suggesting a pathogenesis mechanism for the TOP2B mutations and the role of TOP2B in B-cell development (PMID: 31409799). Additionally, there are b-cell specific knockout and knock-in mouse models that recapitulates disease (PMID: 31409799). In summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/200b690a-182f-489c-b617-566a7d98a8d7","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/677a64c1-b005-44f6-9846-a7f371222667","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/677a64c1-b005-44f6-9846-a7f371222667_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10080","date":"2021-10-19T12:57:36.122Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/677a64c1-b005-44f6-9846-a7f371222667_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10080","date":"2021-10-19T12:57:51.245Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/677a64c1-b005-44f6-9846-a7f371222667_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/677a64c1-b005-44f6-9846-a7f371222667_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2a305557-52c9-4e18-b7a9-7c1cc5cd6bb6","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Using the patient identified allele, Top2b+/EE587E heterozygous mice recapitulated the Hoffman syndrome patient defects in peripheral blood B cells without an effect on peripheral blood T cells.

CRISPR-Cas9 to knock-out TOP2B in HEK-293 cells and expressed in these cells the wild-type and mutant proteins, TOP2BWT and TOP2BA485P. Then studied purified recombinant full-length TOP2BWT and TOP2BA485P proteins using DNA relaxation and decatenation in vitro assays, finding that enzymatic activities of TOP2BA485P were reduced more than 10-fold. In TOP2B-knockout HEK-293 cells, co-expression of TOP2BWT and TOP2BA485P proteins resulted in lower decatenation activity than the expression of TOP2BWT alone. These results indicate that mutant TOP2BA485P protein itself not only has reduced intrinsic enzymatic activity but also exerts a dominant negative effect on the activities of wild-type TOP2B and TOP2A.","functionalDataSupport":"Yes"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cdec94cd-dca7-4654-8d0f-dbe5344b649c_variant_evidence_item"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":0.25},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ed98ea3c-6e9f-4786-a106-56ac3262a84f","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ed98ea3c-6e9f-4786-a106-56ac3262a84f_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"In contrast to WT patient mutations S483L was unable to complement the temperature sensitivity of the top2-4 allele of S. cerevisiae TOP2 at the non-permissive temperature (similar to empty vector control).","functionalDataSupport":"Yes"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ed98ea3c-6e9f-4786-a106-56ac3262a84f_variant_evidence_item"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c65ca8b6-91e5-4eec-b949-e76dffce9af2","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c65ca8b6-91e5-4eec-b949-e76dffce9af2_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"In contrast to WT patient mutations Glu593del (referred to here as EE587E) was unable to complement the temperature sensitivity of the top2-4 allele of S. cerevisiae TOP2 at the non-permissive temperature (similar to empty vector control).","functionalDataSupport":"Yes"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c65ca8b6-91e5-4eec-b949-e76dffce9af2_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31409799","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0b7312fe-f312-4d0d-be2b-3fc8ae9c2c59"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:DeNovoAlleleOrigin"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"No","zygosity":{"id":"cg:Heterozygous"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":3.75}],"evidenceStrength":"Moderate","sequence":3517,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria8","strengthScore":9.75,"subject":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/FcQ-B9KjU2o","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0012243","gene":"hgnc:11990","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"1.0","websiteLegacyID":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/assertion_677a64c1-b005-44f6-9846-a7f371222667-","@context":{"@vocab":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"},"curationReasons":{"@type":"@vocab","@container":"@set"},"GCISnapshot":{"@type":"@id"},"dc:isVersionOf":{"@type":"@id"},"websiteLegacyID":{"@type":"@id"}}}
