Variants in MAP2K2 have only been seen in 2 patients with NS (Takenouchi et al., 2014; van Trier et al., 2015; Rodriguez-Viciana, Tetsu, et al., 2006). The MAP2K2 gene is also located in the Ras/MAPK pathway, which is associated with the NS phenotype (Aoki et al., 2016; Rauen, 2013). Of note, MAP2K2 is also classified as Definitive in association with cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome. The ClinGen RASopathy Expert Panel found no evidence associating MAP2K2 with NS with multiple lentigines, NS-like disorder with loose anagen hair, or Costello syndrome. This curation was approved by the ClinGen RASopathy Gene Curation Expert Panel on 6/1/18 (SOP Version 5).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/115193b4-d9d1-4ec4-8ec8-ce9288301058","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6a0eeefd-9105-435d-9daf-c748e52b0941","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","changes":{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6a0eeefd-9105-435d-9daf-c748e52b0941_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10021","date":"2018-06-01T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6a0eeefd-9105-435d-9daf-c748e52b0941_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10021","date":"2021-03-10T15:47:57.271Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6a0eeefd-9105-435d-9daf-c748e52b0941_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6a0eeefd-9105-435d-9daf-c748e52b0941_ad_other_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/675a6b95-56d5-45d6-9a40-bea01214a5f2_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"This paper was a case study of a boy and his mother who both had NS and carried a variant in MAP2K2.
