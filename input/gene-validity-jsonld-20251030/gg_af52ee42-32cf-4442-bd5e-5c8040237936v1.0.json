This association was made using case-level data and experimental data). At least 7 unique variants (e.g. missense, frameshift, nonsense) have been reported in humans. TPRN was first associated with this disease in humans as early as 2010 (Khan et al.​). Association is seen in at least 9 probands in 6 publications (PMID: 19603065, 20170898,  20170899, 23340767, 25129962). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in at least 20 additional family members. The mechanism for disease is homozygous loss of function. This gene-disease association is supported by expression studies, knockout mice models, biochemical function studies, and protein interaction (PMID: 20170899, 20170899, 27693694, 24285636). In summary, TPRN is definitively associated with autosomal recessive non-syndromic hearing loss. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hearing Loss Working Group on 9/12/2017.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/af52ee42-32cf-4442-bd5e-5c8040237936","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a4dce399-9aeb-452e-a917-3603eb09d11f","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a4dce399-9aeb-452e-a917-3603eb09d11f_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2017-09-12T04:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a4dce399-9aeb-452e-a917-3603eb09d11f_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a4dce399-9aeb-452e-a917-3603eb09d11f_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a4dce399-9aeb-452e-a917-3603eb09d11f_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8faf3367-7ce3-4ba9-a898-115ec116d2ab","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/31478653-454d-4396-ac21-de43c908ec41","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Homozygous mice demonstrated progressive hearing loss with ABR test.
