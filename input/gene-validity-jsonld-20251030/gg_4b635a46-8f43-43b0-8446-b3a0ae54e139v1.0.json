Paull and Gellert in 1998 first reported the role of MRE11 in this pathway, while Heikkinen et al. in 2003 identified the first monoallelic germline variant in this gene in an ovarian cancer patient. MRE11 has been also linked to MRE11-related ataxia with oculomotor apraxia (autosomal recessive) and hereditary breast cancer (autosomal dominant), which were curated separately. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, curations to refute or dispute can be split when needed. This curation focuses on refuting the association with familial ovarian cancer. Evidence curated in this gene-disease relationship includes case level and case-control data (0 Point), and experimental data (1 Point). Five studies (PMIDs: 14684699, 22006311, 29348823, 30441849, 31742824) identified MRE11 germline variants in ovarian cancer patients predominantly through multi-gene panel testing. However, the absence of co-segregation analysis in these studies raises uncertainties regarding whether the variants segregated with cancer. In two of these cases (Walsh et al., 2011 and Koczkowska et al., 2018), carriers were identified with concomitant BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations, a known gene associated with ovarian cancer. Additionally, the pathogenicity of the MRE11 variants in these studies remains inconclusive due to the lack of supporting functional data. Importantly, multiple large case-control studies (PMIDs: 26720728, 28888541, 31406321, 33510186) presented no significant differences in MRE11 variant frequencies between cases and controls. Experimentally, Paull and Gellert (PMID: 9705271) demonstrated the specific enzymatic activities of MRE11 and its collaboration with RAD50 in repairing DNA double-strand breaks, emphasizing their roles in nonhomologous end-joining processes. Additionally, Zhong et al. (PMID: 10426999) found an interaction between BRCA1 and hRad50, forming a complex with hMre11 and p95/nibrin, suggesting BRCA1's cellular responses to DNA damage may be mediated by this complex. However, experimental studies establishing the specific association between MRE11 and familial ovarian cancer are lacking. In summary, given the lack of significant association in large ovarian cancer case-control studies to date, there is convincing evidence refuting the association between MRE11 and autosomal dominant familial ovarian cancer, which significantly outweighs the evidence supporting the association. This gene-disease pair was originally evaluated as disputed by the Breast/Ovarian Cancer GCEP on 10/25/2017. This re-curation as refuted was approved by the ClinGen Hereditary Cancer GCEP on 12/15/2023 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4b635a46-8f43-43b0-8446-b3a0ae54e139","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f5b721c7-52ab-4475-a87e-cb0fa3be198f","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f5b721c7-52ab-4475-a87e-cb0fa3be198f_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10023","date":"2024-04-11T20:54:36.752Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f5b721c7-52ab-4475-a87e-cb0fa3be198f_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10023","date":"2023-12-15T18:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"Given the lack of significant association in large ovarian cancer case-control studies to date, there is convincing evidence refuting the association between MRE11 and autosomal dominant familial ovarian cancer, which significantly outweighs the evidence supporting the association.

Therefore,\nrestricting to PASS-only variants in the ExAC dataset was expected to in\u0002flate risk estimates for each gene. Variants reported as non-PASS were\nreviewed, and were excluded when observed at significantly different\nfrequencies in other populations, genotyped in b20,000 controls, or\ncalled as multiallelic variants at the same position.\nVariants in ExAC that were also observed by Ambry Genetics were\nclassified based on the laboratory classification system. All other non\u0002sense, frameshift, consensus dinucleotide splice site (±1 or 2) were\nclassified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic and were included in anal\u0002yses. The remaining missense, splice site (±3+ positions), synony\u0002mous, or intronic variants were classified as pathogenic/likely\npathogenic when reported as pathogenic or likely pathogenic by at\nleast one clinical laboratory in ClinVar [23], with no conflicting reports\n(Benign/Likely Benign).\nFollowing variant classification, some additional exclusions were ap\u0002plied. Variants with minor allele frequency (MAF) N 0.3% (except com\u0002mon founder mutations) in OC cases or ExAC controls were excluded\nfrom the study. Additionally, three individual variants associated with lower risks than the “average” pathogenic variant (BRCA1*R1699Q;\nCHEK2*I157T; CHEK2*S468F) were excluded from both cases and con\u0002trols. Protein truncating variants in the last exon or the last 55 bp of\nthe penultimate exon were excluded from cases and controls due to in\u0002fluences of nonsense mediated mRNA decay, unless a known functional\ndomain was disrupted. Potential mosaic variants in cases with an allele\nratio N 70:30 were excluded from the case allele count. Large genomic\nrearrangements (LGRs) and variants in the PMS2 pseudogene region\n(exons 9 and 11–15) were not included in risk analyses because these\nvariants were not validated in ExAC; however these were included in\nthe allele count for the case-case analyses.","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6bde73ce-f6de-4df2-9ba3-152d102934d9_cc_evidence_item"}],"numWithVariant":10},"lowerConfidenceLimit":0.47,"method":{"id":"cg:AggregateVariantAnalysis"},"pValue":0.78,"statisticalSignificanceType":"","statisticalSignificanceValue":1.17,"statisticalSignificanceValueType":"Relative Risk","upperConfidenceLimit":2.41}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCaseControlAggregateVariantAnalysisCriteria"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/284139ff-fe42-4a06-bf34-92b0b1ad96c7","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Contradicts","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/284139ff-fe42-4a06-bf34-92b0b1ad96c7_cc_evidence_item","type":"Finding","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26720728","rdfs:label":"OC patients Vs ExAC and ESP","caseCohort":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c76840b6-8592-4461-bb79-c28aafefe11e","type":"Cohort","allGenotypedSequenced":1915,"alleleFrequency":0.001044386422976501,"detectionMethod":"Germline DNA extracted from blood was sequenced using BROCA, a targeted capture, massively parallel sequencing test developed at the University of Washington.15 For this study, we sequenced ATM, BARD1, BRCA1, BRCA2, BRIP1, CHEK2, FAM175A, FANCP, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, MRE11A, NBN, PALB2, PMS2, PTEN, RAD50, RAD51C, RAD51D, and TP53.

Five of five in-silico tools predict a damaging effect of the variant on protein function. The variant allele was found at a frequency of 5.7e-05 in 282364 control chromosomes (gnomAD). This frequency is not significantly higher than estimated for a pathogenic variant in MRE11 causing Hereditary Breast And Ovarian Cancer Syndrome (5.7e-05 vs 6.3e-05), allowing no conclusion about variant significance. c.913C>T has been reported in the literature in individuals affected with ovarian cancer, prostate cancer or cerebellar ataxia (Heikkinen_2003, Rantapero_2020, da Graa_2021). These reports do not provide unequivocal conclusions about association of the variant with Hereditary Breast And Ovarian Cancer Syndrome. At least one publication reports experimental evidence evaluating an impact on protein function and it showed hR305W was sensitive to DNA damage reagents (MMS/HU) (Harris_2021). The following publications have been ascertained in the context of this evaluation (PMID: 33510186, 34075539, 14684699, 24093751, 22078559, 32183364, 33956305).

The p.M26T variant (also known as c.77T>C), located in coding exon 2 of the MRE11A gene, results from a T to C substitution at nucleotide position 77. The methionine at codon 26 is replaced by threonine, an amino acid with similar properties. This alteration has been detected in trans with a second pathogenic mutation in MRE11A in an individual with combined dystonia (Zech M et al. Neurogenetics, 2017 Dec;18:195-205), and was detected in an individual with nervous system abnormalities who underwent whole exome sequencing (Retterer K et al. Genet Med, 2016 07;18:696-704). This variant was also reported in 12/60,466 breast cancer cases and in 5/53,461 controls (Dorling et al. N Engl J Med. 2021 02;384:428-439). This amino acid position is not well conserved in available vertebrate species. In addition, this alteration is predicted to be tolerated by in silico analysis.
