Disease-causing variants in the *HNRNPH2* gene have been found to cause a disorder originally known as *HNRNPH2*-related intellectual disability syndrome, which is characterized by developmental delay/intellectual disability, speech and language difficulties, behavioral problems, and hypotonia. Most of the disease-causing variants are *de novo*, missense variants located within or near the nuclear localization sequence (NLS), a highly conserved region between amino acids 194 and 220 that is essential for interaction with nuclear transport receptors. Of note, five male patients with nonsense and frameshift variants have been reported. They display milder phenotypes including developmental delay/intellectual disability, autistic features, and/or psychiatric co-morbidities.\n\nFifteen variants (missense, nonsense, frameshift) that have been reported in fifteen probands, in four publications (PMIDs: 27545675, 30887513, 33728377, 34907471), are included in this curation. Due to the gene having a single coding exon, protein truncating variants (PTVs) are anticipated to escape nonsense mediated decay. Due to this, the default score for PTVs has been decreased to 1.0  for this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. \n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by mice models and functional assays in patients’ cells (PMIDs: 34907471, 37463454). These studies both showed aberrant splice patterns in patients’ cells (induced pluripotent stem cells and primary dermal fibroblasts) harboring missense variants. Additionally, knock-in mice bearing two distinct pathogenic NLS variants (P209L, R206W) in *Hnrnph2* demonstrated a phenotypic spectrum highly similar to clinical features observed in human patients, including craniofacial abnormalities, impaired motor function, and increased susceptibility to audiogenic seizures; male mice also had reduced survival. In contrast, two independent *Hnrnph2* knockout (KO) mice showed no detectable phenotypes.The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be gain of function or dominant negative based on the mouse model (PMID: 37463454), but additional evidence is still required for a comprehensive understanding. \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *HNRNPH2* and X-linked complex neurodevelopmental disorder.
