At least 5 unique variants (3 frameshift, 1 nonsense, 1 silent variant in splice consensus sequence) have been reported in at least 4 probands in 4 publications (PMIDs: 22678063, 26969326, 34795337, 37561809). A frameshift variant that was reported in 2 probands and segregated in 2 additional family members (PMID: 22678063, 37561809) has also been reported in 2 families with ectodermal dysplasia and normal hearing (PMID: 27736875). Another nonsense variant that was observed as a homozygous variant in a proband was found to be heterozygous in the proband’s affected sibling and unaffected mother (PMID: 34795337). Moreover, a heterozygous missense variant with no second variant was reported in 1 proband (PMID: 30733538). This gene-disease relationship is supported by expression studies in murine cochlear tissue as well as functional alteration studies of null variants in non-patient cells (PMID: 22678063). Additionally, a *TSPEAR* K14-Cre knockdown revealed effects of *Tspear* knockdown in mice hair follicles and *NOTCH1* signaling but was not assessed for hearing loss (PMID: 27736875). In summary, the relationship between *TSPEAR* and autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss has been disputed. More evidence is needed to either support or refute the role *TSPEAR* plays in this disease. This gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the ClinGen Hearing Loss GCEP on 09/26/2017 as per SOP v6. It was reevaluated on 10/31/2024 using SOP v11. As a result of this reevaluation, this record underwent a review to be consistent with SOP v11. New case level evidence has been reviewed, but the classification did not change (PMIDs: 30733538, 34795337, 37561809).\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c5851e41-1343-42cc-b37c-c97a18d1ae67","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f0928b06-d3bb-41fe-8222-d7f0e6c0a25a","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","changes":[{"id":"cg:sopChange"},{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},{"id":"cg:newEvidence"},{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f0928b06-d3bb-41fe-8222-d7f0e6c0a25a_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2024-10-31T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f0928b06-d3bb-41fe-8222-d7f0e6c0a25a_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2024-11-13T03:35:08.348Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"The TSPEAR gene has been associated with ARSNHL in 4 probands in 4 publications. 5 unique variants (3 frameshift, 1 nonsense, 1 silent variant in splice consensus sequence) have been reported in humans, and variants in this gene segregated with disease in 4 additional family members. While functional studies and evidence of 1 homozygous frameshift variant segregating with prelingual profound sensorineural hearing loss suggest that this gene may play a role in hearing, the same frameshift variant has also been reported in 2 families with ectodermal dysplasia and normal hearing (Peled 2012).  This is the main source of conflicting evidence for this gene. The presence of LOF variants in patients with ectodermal dysplasia and normal hearing suggests that this gene may not cause hearing loss, and therefore, this relationship is classified as Disputed. Moreover, variants in this gene have been identified heterozygous in individuals with hearing loss which is inconsistent with the mode of inheritance of this gene-disease relationship.","curationReasons":["RecurationTiming"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f0928b06-d3bb-41fe-8222-d7f0e6c0a25a_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f0928b06-d3bb-41fe-8222-d7f0e6c0a25a_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/419e4525-ff46-489f-b375-b21fd27a77a9","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8b2367c8-9a0b-431c-b432-f13a368a49da","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Used RT-PCR to investigate the expression of TSPEAR in murine cochlea tissue microdissected form the organ of Corti and found that TSPEAR was located in the inner hair cells, the cochlear ganglion and stria vascularis, P7 vestibular end organs, P1, P7 and adult inferior colliculus and the remaining brainstem where auditory nuclei are located.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22678063","rdfs:label":"Expression in Murine Cochlea","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f0928b06-d3bb-41fe-8222-d7f0e6c0a25a_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/83022c1c-d442-4e4c-8645-070923cf50b2","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"0.5 point each for replication of functional changes of the variant found in human in two different cell lines and methods.","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/eaff0ae9-48f9-4b68-b5c1-ef012cc780c5","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Transfected HEK293 cells with the c.1726G>T+c.1728delC mutations in TSPEAR as well as the wild-type to determine that the termination of translation occurred in the sixth EAR repeat.
