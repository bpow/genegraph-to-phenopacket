The phenotypes of CYFIP2-related complex neurodevelopmental disorder vary from developmental epileptic encephalopathy with severe epilepsy, profound intellectual disability and hypotonia to mild or moderate intellectual disability without seizures. Twenty heterozygous missense variants reported in twenty-eight probands in three publications are included in this curation (PMID: 29534297, 30664714, 33149277). Variants found in most individuals with CYFIP2-related complex neurodevelopmental disorder are of de novo origin. Of the 28 probands, 13 carried hotspot variants at arginine 87 and had developmental epileptic encephalopathy phenotypes. \n\nFunctional studies of several missense variants including the recurrent p.Arg87Cys variant showed gain-of-function effects (PMID: 29534297, 32486060). While four cases of putative loss-of-function variants have been reported, the Epilepsy GCEP decided not to include these cases in the curation because the role of loss-of-function variants as a disease mechanism is unclear at this time. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *CYFIP2* and autosomal dominant complex neurodevelopmental disorder. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification has been approved by ClinGen Epilepsy GCEP on the meeting date, May 6, 2025 (SOP version 11).\n\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/002d2ec6-ee65-4c8d-8032-7e338fb47d27","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/af61bf34-00d4-4867-9a0b-415e4f6bcfa8","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/af61bf34-00d4-4867-9a0b-415e4f6bcfa8_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10005","date":"2025-06-27T14:07:52.146Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/af61bf34-00d4-4867-9a0b-415e4f6bcfa8_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10005","date":"2025-05-06T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/af61bf34-00d4-4867-9a0b-415e4f6bcfa8_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/af61bf34-00d4-4867-9a0b-415e4f6bcfa8_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bf14c326-b224-4bd8-83c2-1174462409bd","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Without EEG recordings, it is not clear whether the spasm-like behaviors are seizures.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Inconclusive","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5b6dc963-cefb-4f3b-b71e-a84a486dd9f1","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Five of Nine P8 CYFIP2^R87C/+ heterozygous pups showed spontaneous spasmlike movements consisting of extension of 4 limbs followed by jerking movement, which resembles epileptic spasms as they appear in West syndrome patients.
