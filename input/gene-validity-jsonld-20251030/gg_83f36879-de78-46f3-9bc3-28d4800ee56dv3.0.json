The SLFN14 gene encodes an RNA endoribonuclease protein that regulates ribosomal RNA degradation. Platelet-type bleeding disorder 20 is characterized by moderate thrombocytopenia, enlarged platelets, reduce ATP secretion and aggregation in response to ADP, collagen, and protease activated receptor-1 (PAR-1) and a bleeding diathesis. Evidence supporting this gene-disease curation includes case level data and experimental data.\n\nSummary of Case Level Data (4.25 points): Six unique missense variants have been reported in humans. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 9 probands in 6 publications (Fletcher et al., 2015, PMID: 26280575; Marconi et al., 2016, PMID: 26769223; Saes et al., 2019, PMID: 30431218; Turro et al., 2020, PMID: 32581362; Ang et al., 2022, PMID: 36237120; Polokhov et al., 2023, PMID: 37041648).  Variants in this gene segregated with disease in at least 12 additional family members.\n\nSummary of Experimental Evidence (4 points): The gene-disease relationship is supported by expression studies (Fletcher et al., 2015, PMID: 26280575), biochemical function (Pisareva et al., 2015, PMID: 25996083), functional alteration (patient and non-patient cells) (Ver Donck et al., 2023, PMID: 36790527; Fletcher et al., 2018, PMID: 29678925; Marconi et al., 2016, PMID: 26769223), and a mouse model system (Stapley et al., 2021, PMID: 33496736).\n\nIn summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship.\n\nThis gene-disease relationship was originally curated by the ClinGen Hemostasis and Thrombosis (H/T) Gene Curation Expert Panel using the Gene Clinical Validity Standard Operating Procedures (SOP), Version 7 and approved on May 25, 2022.  This gene-disease pair was re-curated on November 4th, 2024 using Gene Clinical Validity Standard Operating Procedures (SOP), Version 11.\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/83f36879-de78-46f3-9bc3-28d4800ee56d","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f31ec838-fc84-47a2-9341-1fe494788a09","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","changes":[{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"},{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},{"id":"cg:newEvidence"},{"id":"cg:sopChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f31ec838-fc84-47a2-9341-1fe494788a09_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2025-06-16T17:19:38.630Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f31ec838-fc84-47a2-9341-1fe494788a09_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2025-06-16T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["RecurationTiming"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f31ec838-fc84-47a2-9341-1fe494788a09_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ba463325-a91d-4e02-a8c5-cdde0675873b","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The damaging effect of variant c.655A>G, p.K219E is not supported by functional evidence.
