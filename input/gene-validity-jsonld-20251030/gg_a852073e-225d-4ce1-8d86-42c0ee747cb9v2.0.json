At least 22 unique variants (including many missense/nonsense, as well as frameshift and large deletions) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data.\n\nSummary of Case Level Data: 12 points\nVariants in this gene have been reported in at least 10 probands in 6 publications (PMIDs: 9544843, 16917729, 1357662, 16318910, 27832414, 18945316). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 8 additional family members.\nMore evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached.\n\nSummary of Experimental Evidence: 0.5 points\nThis gene-disease relationship is supported by the biochemical function of TAT, the conversion of tyrosine to p-hydroxylphenylpyruvate. Hypertyrosinemia occurs due to lack of TAT enzymatic activity.\n\nIn summary, TAT is definitively associated with autosomal recessive Tyrosinemia Type II. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a852073e-225d-4ce1-8d86-42c0ee747cb9","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7a28aa11-78af-4c3b-900e-79c6a1e9339a","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":[{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"},{"id":"cg:sopChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7a28aa11-78af-4c3b-900e-79c6a1e9339a_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10011","date":"2020-09-16T19:23:17.648Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7a28aa11-78af-4c3b-900e-79c6a1e9339a_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10011","date":"2020-06-29T17:42:08.705Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7a28aa11-78af-4c3b-900e-79c6a1e9339a_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c1a14019-d4fb-440c-895d-a54f5059a68b_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The homozygous (due to consanguinity) missense variant, Leu201Arg, occurs at a highly conserved residue implicating an important structural or functional role.

Hypertyrosinemia occurs due to lack of TAT enzymatic activity, as observed in the patient's soluble liver fraction of TAT. It is hypothesized that tyrosine crystals are causally related to the production of epithelial lesions and photophobia in affected individuals.\n\nAs reviewed in PMID: 16602095 elevated tyrosine and the resulting phenotypes in patients is a direct result of the deficient biochemical function of TAT. A low‐protein diet and the use of a special formula that is free of phenylalanine and tyrosine are effective in lowering the plasma level of tyrosine, allowing resolution of both eye and skin symptoms within days to several weeks. As such the biochemical function of TAT is highly correlated with the associated disease of tyrosinemia type II.","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ea394646-678c-4d51-a8cd-ae13dc72aa2e","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Hypertyrosinemia occurs due to lack of TAT enzymatic activity, as observed in the patient's soluble liver fraction of TAT.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/4389443","rdfs:label":"TAT Assay","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":939,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria7","strengthScore":14,"subject":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bHa-ANyTKWo","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0010160","gene":"hgnc:11573","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"2.0","websiteLegacyID":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/assertion_7a28aa11-78af-4c3b-900e-79c6a1e9339a-","@context":{"@vocab":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"},"curationReasons":{"@type":"@vocab","@container":"@set"},"GCISnapshot":{"@type":"@id"},"dc:isVersionOf":{"@type":"@id"},"websiteLegacyID":{"@type":"@id"}}}
