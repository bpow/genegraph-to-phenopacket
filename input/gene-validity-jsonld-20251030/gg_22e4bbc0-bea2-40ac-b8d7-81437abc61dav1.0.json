SAMD9 has been associated with MIRAGE syndrome (OMIM 617053), Monosomy 7 myelodysplasia and leukemia syndrome 2 (OMIM 619041), and Tumoral calcinosis, familial, normophosphatemic (OMIM 610455). Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found differences in inheritance pattern, molecular mechanism and phenotypic variability. Therefore, the disease entities have been split into two disease entities by inheritance pattern. The autosomal dominant MIRAGE syndrome and Monosomy 7 myelodysplasia and leukemia syndrome 2 were lumped together while the recessive Tumoral calcinosis, familial, normophosphatemic was split. This curation addresses SAMD9 in relation to normophosphatemic familial tumoral calcinosis. Two unique variants (missense and nonsense) that have been reported in at least 6 probands in 2 publications (PMIDs: 16960814, 18094730) are included in this curation. All probands were of Jewish-Yemenite origin and 5 of the 6 probands were identified to be homozygous for a missense variant. The missense variant has also been reported as a homozygous occurrence in a proband on ClinVar (LabCorp, ClinVar Accession: SCV004294513.1). This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence including biochemical function and altered expression in patient cells (PMIDs: 16960814, 18094730). In summary, there is limited evidence supporting the relationship between SAMD9 and autosomal recessive normophosphatemic familial tumoral calcinosis. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Childhood, Adolescent, and Young Adult Cancer Predisposition GCEP on the meeting date February 11th, 2025 (SOP Version 11).\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/22e4bbc0-bea2-40ac-b8d7-81437abc61da","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0ac34dc9-b3df-4ac7-83e1-af4e4fcee384","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0ac34dc9-b3df-4ac7-83e1-af4e4fcee384_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10157","date":"2025-02-11T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0ac34dc9-b3df-4ac7-83e1-af4e4fcee384_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10157","date":"2025-03-26T13:40:55.364Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0ac34dc9-b3df-4ac7-83e1-af4e4fcee384_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0ac34dc9-b3df-4ac7-83e1-af4e4fcee384_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/352c0125-d677-443d-b1f7-9fbabc311cb9","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/eabebf2d-12bb-4a63-9bcf-0340457ea4aa","type":"Finding","dc:description":"NFTC is characterized by massive periarticular, and seldom visceral, deposition of calcified tumors.
