{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/84c0ab6d-c055-4d2d-a56c-a6d1f47da86ev1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"The relationship between OPA1 and Leigh syndrome spectrum (LSS) was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of December 16, 2020. The OPA1 gene encodes a mitochondrial dynamin-like GTPase that localizes to the mitochondrial inner membrane and coordinates inner membrane fusion. Mitochondria are dynamic organelles constantly moving along the cell cytoskeleton and form functional networks in many cells. Mitochondria undergo frequent fusion and fission events, which allow formation of these networks. Defects in OPA1 lead to impaired mitochondrial fusion and dynamics.\n\nThe OPA1 gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Leigh syndrome spectrum in 2017 (PMID: 28494813). Of note, variants in OPA1 are more frequently associated with autosomal dominant optic atrophy with or without additional multisystem features, or with Behr syndrome, characterized by optic atrophy and neurologic features and inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Evidence supporting the relationship between OPA1 and LSS includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included five unique variants identified in four cases from two publications (PMID: 28494813, 28442211). No segregation data were available. Loss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease association is also supported by known biochemical function, expression, and animal models (PMIDs: 33092941, 18853439, 17428816).\n\nIn summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on December 16, 2020 (SOP Version 7).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/84c0ab6d-c055-4d2d-a56c-a6d1f47da86e","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7e72abd1-4b0a-4f66-b681-7a51d4467026","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7e72abd1-4b0a-4f66-b681-7a51d4467026_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2021-06-14T15:21:17.821Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7e72abd1-4b0a-4f66-b681-7a51d4467026_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2021-06-14T15:21:48.957Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7e72abd1-4b0a-4f66-b681-7a51d4467026_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7e72abd1-4b0a-4f66-b681-7a51d4467026_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d0fb5956-8892-41ae-8b5c-64a435f016ac","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Scored the default for embryonic lethal KO mouse","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/53248286-9390-498d-a88d-c55b2cf0cf84","type":"Finding","dc:description":"KO mouse is embryonic lethal by 13.5 days post coitum.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17428816","rdfs:label":"Homozygous KO mouse model (Q285Ter) ","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7e72abd1-4b0a-4f66-b681-7a51d4467026_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4e3a4c39-c09e-4ed4-92e9-67c48c103013","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Other genes involved in the mitochondrial  fusion/fission pathway are associated with Leigh syndrome spectrum: MFF, SLC25A46, DMN1L.
