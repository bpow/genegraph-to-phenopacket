PDHA1 was first reported in relation to X-linked Leigh syndrome spectrum in 1993 (Matthews et al., PMID 8498846). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in numerous probands in numerous publications (PMIDs 7887409, 8962591, 8664900, 9187674, 9671272, 10679936, 12621116, 15384102, 20002461, 21914562). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. This gene-disease association is supported by the known biochemical function, protein interaction, functional studies in patient cell lines, and animal models.  PDHA1 encodes the E1 alpha subunit of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC). PDC catalyzes conversion of pyruvate into acetyl-CoA, thus is the link between glycolysis and the citric acid cycle. PDC deficiency leads to impaired energy metabolism. In summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between PDHA1 and X-linked Leigh syndrome spectrum. This classification was approved by the NICHD U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on March 25, 2019 (SOP Version 6).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5d90a0f0-212a-4607-833a-96e50987d806","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a579324c-3586-4636-9192-c2ea29391a4e","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a579324c-3586-4636-9192-c2ea29391a4e_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2019-04-08T16:12:03.224Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a579324c-3586-4636-9192-c2ea29391a4e_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a579324c-3586-4636-9192-c2ea29391a4e_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a579324c-3586-4636-9192-c2ea29391a4e_ad_dn_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/08a9b6bd-f925-4d08-a8a2-2f8157e227d3_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Seen in many individuals with Leigh syndrome (PMID: 15384102;
