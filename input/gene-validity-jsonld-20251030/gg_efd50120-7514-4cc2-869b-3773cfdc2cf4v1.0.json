Since its first description, however, no further associated CMT families have been published. Contrarily, the only reported variant has been found in a homozygous state in 4 unaffected individuals (GnomAD). Re-assessing the first and only reported family by WES, Leal et al. identified a homozygous stop mutation in PNKP, a gene that is located in the same linkage region (Leal et al., 2018; PMID: 11112660). The authors identified 5 further families carrying biallelic loss-of-function mutations in PNKP as well, pointing towards the pathogenicity of this gene over MED25. With no further strong experimental evidence supporting the gene-disease relationship between MED25 and CMT2B, we thereby classify the gene as “DISPUTED”. The likewise associated, autosomal recessive Basel-Vanagaite-Smirin-Yosef syndrome has a congenital age at onset and does not include neuropathy in its phenotypic spectrum. \n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/efd50120-7514-4cc2-869b-3773cfdc2cf4","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c0e0d66f-c68d-4df3-bab2-71afc448e4b0","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"NoKnownDiseaseRelationship","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c0e0d66f-c68d-4df3-bab2-71afc448e4b0_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10063","date":"2021-03-22T20:15:27.084Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c0e0d66f-c68d-4df3-bab2-71afc448e4b0_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10063","date":"2021-03-22T20:15:43.070Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"Only one CMT2B family described with one mutation, WES identified another gene in the same family.","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c0e0d66f-c68d-4df3-bab2-71afc448e4b0_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4d556106-cd4c-4929-8e86-dcd42214d1eb_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"In 2018, identification of the homozygous stop mutation c.1549C>T; p.Gln517Ter in PNKP by WES in the same family.

Co-segregation with MED25 missense variant in all cases indicating an ancestral founder haplotype. PNKP is located within the critical linkage region on chromosome 19q13.33. It catalyzes the 5-prime phosphorylation of nucleic acids and has an associated 3-prime phosphatase activity, an important function in DNA repair. Biallelic variants in this gene were previously linked to progressive cerebellar atrophy and polyneuropathy, ataxia with oculomotor apraxia 4 (MIM 616267), or microcephaly with seizures and developmental delay (MIM 613402). Identification of five more costa rican families with an axonal CMT phenotype all carrying biallelic LOF mutations in PNKP.
