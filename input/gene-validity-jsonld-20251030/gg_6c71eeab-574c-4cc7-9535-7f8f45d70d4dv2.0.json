PKD1 was first associated with this disease in humans in 1994 (The European Polycystic Kidney Disease Consortium). Variants in this gene segregate with disease and can occur de novo. The mechanism for disease is known to be loss of function. 125 unique variants (missense, in-frame indel, nonsense, frameshift, large deletion and complex rearrangements) have been classified as Pathogenic in ClinVar, 86 of which are frameshift, nonsense or canonical splice changes. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. This gene-disease association is supported by ample experimental evidence including expression studies, biochemical function, protein interactions and animal models that recapitulate the human disease. In summary, PKD1 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen General Gene Curation  Working Group on 5/22/2019\n(SOP Version 6).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6c71eeab-574c-4cc7-9535-7f8f45d70d4d","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3b75b204-fa56-4535-ac14-6949323dad97","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/09d61dec-314b-4c5f-af2e-f22fc5992c12_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10066","date":"2021-02-26T15:13:56.823Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/09d61dec-314b-4c5f-af2e-f22fc5992c12_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10066","date":"2021-02-26T15:14:09.535Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3b75b204-fa56-4535-ac14-6949323dad97_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10066","date":"2021-02-26T15:14:09.535Z","role":"Unpublisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/09d61dec-314b-4c5f-af2e-f22fc5992c12_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/09d61dec-314b-4c5f-af2e-f22fc5992c12_seg_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/79f359fe-b4fa-437a-afed-0df32a2e0860_family_segregation","type":"FamilyCosegregation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8792818","rdfs:label":"Family 1308 – Segregation Scoring","estimatedLodScore":2.11,"family":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/79f359fe-b4fa-437a-afed-0df32a2e0860","type":"Family","rdfs:label":"Family 1308 – Segregation Scoring","ethnicity":{"id":"cg:NotHispanicOrLatino"}},"meetsInclusionCriteria":true,"phenotypePositiveAllelePositive":7,"sequencingMethod":{"id":"cg:CandidateGeneSequencing"}},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0cf15cc9-5b2b-4652-b2ea-2f2f9195ae09_proband_segregation","type":"FamilyCosegregation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11012875","rdfs:label":"Family DA1","family":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0cf15cc9-5b2b-4652-b2ea-2f2f9195ae09","type":"Family","rdfs:label":"Family DA1","ethnicity":{"id":"cg:NotHispanicOrLatino"},"member":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/46d17eee-c793-4340-aa18-76513de59079","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11012875","rdfs:label":"DA1","detectionMethod":"Used a long-range polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based strategy to analyze exons in the replicated region of PKD1 in a population of 41 unrelated Thai and 6 unrelated Korean families with ADPKD and performed single-stand conformation analysis (SSCA) on the nested PCR products.
