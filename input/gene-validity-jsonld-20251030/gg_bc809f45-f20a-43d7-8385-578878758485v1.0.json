{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bc809f45-f20a-43d7-8385-578878758485v1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"The GPAA1 gene is located on chromosome 8 at 8q24.3 and encodes the glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor attachment 1, a ubiquitously expressed protein which is a component of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) transamidase complex that mediates coupling of the synthesized GPI anchor to mature proteins on the cell surface. GPI anchor proteins are structurally a diverse group of membrane bound glycoproteins that play an important role in cellular processes such as embryogenesis, fertilization, and neurogenesis. The GPAA1 gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive glycosylphosphatidylinositol biosynthesis defect 15 in 2017 (Nguyen et al., 2017 PMID 29100095) and is characterized by delayed psychomotor development, variable intellectual disability, hypotonia, early-onset seizures in most patients, and cerebellar atrophy resulting in gait ataxia and dysarthria. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data. At least 16 unique variants have been reported in either a compound heterozygous or homozygous state in 8 probands from two publications (PMID 29100095; Castle et al., 2021 PMID: 34703884). These included 10 missense variants, five frameshift variants, and one intronic variant shown to affect splicing.  Variants in this gene segregate with disease in five families. More genetic evidence has been reported in the literature but was not scorable according to the current guideline. This gene-disease relationship is supported by relevant experimental evidence including biochemical function, protein interaction, and functional alteration in patient cells. A number of genes involved in the biosynthesis of the GPI anchor have been associated with GPI biosynthesis deficiencies, characterized by a clinical spectrum of disease which includes global developmental delay, intellectual disability, and seizures (PMID 29100095). Specifically, four components of the GPI transamidase complex; PIGT, PIGS, PIGK, and PIGU have been shown to interact with each other and have all been associated with autosomal recessive glycosylphosphatidylinositol biosynthesis deficiencies (Ohishi K et al., 2001 PMID 11483512; Bellai-Dussault et al., 2018 PMID 30054924; Hong Y et al., 2003 PMID 12802054). Patient cells demonstrate GPI-AP deficiency and altered expression of cell surface markers on the cell surface of skin fibroblasts (PMID 29100095). In summary, there is strong evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Three years must elapse from the first proposal of the association to reach a definitive classification without any valid contradictory evidence. We will re-evaluate this gene-disease relationship at that time to determine if an upgraded classification of definitive is warranted.. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Syndromic Disorders Gene Curation Expert Panel on the meeting date 12/07/2022 (SOP Version 9.0).
