Tyrosinemia is primarily a biochemical phenotype with elevated tyrosine, 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate, and its derivatives; it remains unclear if tyrosinemia type III is a predisposing factor that is strongly associated with cognitive delays, or if the association is purely on the basis of ascertainment bias. At least 7 unique variants (4 missense, 2 nonsense, and 1 splicing) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 7 probands in 5 publications (PMIDs: 10942115, 11073718, 28649543, 23036342, 31901053). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 2 additional family members. Of note, this gene has been implicated in autosomal dominant Hawkinsinuria, in which the primary presentation is metabolic acidosis and a single reported pathogenic mutation has been identified. This will be assessed separately. The gene disease relationship is supported by biochemical function, animal models, and rescue experiments. The biochemical function of HPD in tyrosine metabolism accounts for the typical high plasma tyrosine and high levels of 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate and its derivatives in urine of Tyrosinemia Type 3 patients. A homozygous loss of function mouse exhibits similar biochemical phenotypes which can be rescued by adenoviral expression of human HPD. In summary, HPD is definitively associated with autosomal recessive Tyrosinemia Type 3.\n\nPer criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found differences in molecular mechanism (partial verses full loss of function), inheritance pattern (autosomal dominant verses recessive), and phenotypic variability (biochemical phenotype verses clinical manifestations). Therefore, we have split curations for the disease entities, Tyrosinemia type III and Hawkinsinuria.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/19f8752b-a47e-4fa6-b627-f63965104f3e","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/89eb4236-9243-490b-bc73-fb3b99675eb9","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":[{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},{"id":"cg:sopChange"},{"id":"cg:classificationChange"},{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"},{"id":"cg:newEvidence"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/89eb4236-9243-490b-bc73-fb3b99675eb9_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10011","date":"2020-06-29T17:36:06.841Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/89eb4236-9243-490b-bc73-fb3b99675eb9_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10011","date":"2020-09-16T19:23:17.629Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/89eb4236-9243-490b-bc73-fb3b99675eb9_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/89eb4236-9243-490b-bc73-fb3b99675eb9_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/03c7994c-d719-45ce-9484-fbc93b3908bb","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Developed two methods to measure the enzymatic activity of HPD, by production of homogentisate.

This is the same variant identified as homozygous in Family 2 of PMID 10942115, in which two brothers were also diagnosed later in life and showed just slight psychomotor retardation.","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d077cb7b-9531-432d-9eae-f63fdd68e565","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28649543","rdfs:label":"Szymanska_Case","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":11,"detectionMethod":"Clinical suspicion of HT3 was made and confirmed genetically with the next generation sequencing of HPD.","firstTestingMethod":"Next generation sequencing panels","phenotypeFreeText":"plasma tyrosine 535 μmol/L (normal values: 29–86 μmol/L)","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0003607","obo:HP_0003231","obo:HP_0003161","obo:HP_0000093"],"previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b0861a8f-13d9-40b7-b946-6f516c52f49a_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28649543","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cb6bb34b-cee0-4019-a723-b83ba4d07d4b"}}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":5.35}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":929,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria7","strengthScore":11.35,"subject":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/pudWBtR_qRw","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0010162","gene":"hgnc:5147","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"2.0","websiteLegacyID":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/assertion_89eb4236-9243-490b-bc73-fb3b99675eb9-","@context":{"@vocab":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"},"curationReasons":{"@type":"@vocab","@container":"@set"},"GCISnapshot":{"@type":"@id"},"dc:isVersionOf":{"@type":"@id"},"websiteLegacyID":{"@type":"@id"}}}
