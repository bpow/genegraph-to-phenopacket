The NDUFS7 gene encodes the NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) core subunit S7. Defects of this protein lead to complex I deficiency. \n\nThe NDUFS7 gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Leigh syndrome spectrum in 1999 (PMID: 10360771). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data.\n\nThis curation included two unique variants identified in four cases from three publications (PMIDs: 10360771, 17604671, 22644603). No segregation data were available. Loss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease association is also supported by known protein interactions, functional alteration in patient cells, and animal models (PMIDs: 15269216, 30429455, 30972103, 27509854). \n\nIn summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel August 21, 2019 (SOP Version 7).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6718f327-056c-42c1-9194-e5e4be151868","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b702a150-de60-429e-bb12-ba8cde1483e7","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b702a150-de60-429e-bb12-ba8cde1483e7_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b702a150-de60-429e-bb12-ba8cde1483e7_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2019-11-25T16:00:08.570Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b702a150-de60-429e-bb12-ba8cde1483e7_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/aa054557-0572-463f-ad74-5b3a556921a9_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Cryptic splice site introduced by variant leading to additional cryptic exon between exons 1 and 2 , 122 bp.
