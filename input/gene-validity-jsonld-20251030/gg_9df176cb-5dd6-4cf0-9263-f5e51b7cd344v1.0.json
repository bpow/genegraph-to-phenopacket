IRIDA is characterized by congenital iron deficiency (ID) that is poorly responsive to oral iron treatment. Of note, this gene has also been implicated in autosomal dominant IRIDA due to observations of carriers of truncating variants in this gene showing lower Hb, MCV, and TSAT/hepcidin ratios, which is also supported by mouse models showing that TMPRSS6 haploinsufficiency increases susceptibility to iron deficiency (PMID: 20688966; PMID: 35893046; PMID: 40081160). However, as these AD phenotypes appear to be modulated by environmental factors, the following disease entities have been lumped into one disease entity, iron-refractory iron deficiency anemia (OMIM: 206200), per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group. Several variants (e.g., missense, nonsense, frameshift, indels) have been reported in multiple probands in four publications (PMID: 29895660; PMID: 22581667; PMID: 20232450; PMID: 36261087; PMID: 36690839) and are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is reported to be loss of function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by animal models, where recessive, chemically induced mutant mouse phenotypes are characterized by progressive loss of body (but not facial) hair and microcytic anemia (PMID: 18451267). In summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between TMPRSS6 and autosomal recessive iron-refractory iron deficiency anemia (IRIDA). This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen IEM GCEP at the meeting on August 22 (SOP Version 11).\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9df176cb-5dd6-4cf0-9263-f5e51b7cd344","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/566f2e6c-d7dc-4ad2-a44d-b7c46b51d98a","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Strong","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/566f2e6c-d7dc-4ad2-a44d-b7c46b51d98a_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10097","date":"2025-08-27T21:10:31.416Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/566f2e6c-d7dc-4ad2-a44d-b7c46b51d98a_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10097","date":"2025-08-27T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"first paper from 2008.","curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/566f2e6c-d7dc-4ad2-a44d-b7c46b51d98a_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/129db154-9797-4449-ac28-263113257c17_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b4f42a17-2ab5-4d6f-b371-b262db8c2e2c","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b4f42a17-2ab5-4d6f-b371-b262db8c2e2c_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"5: The four missense IRIDA mutants are not transactivated by WT MT2.\nHuh7 cells were transfected with an HJV expressing vector.
