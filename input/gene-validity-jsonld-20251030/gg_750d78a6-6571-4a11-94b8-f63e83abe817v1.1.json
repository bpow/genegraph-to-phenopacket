The *COX6B1* gene encodes cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV) subunit 6B1. Defects of this protein lead to complex IV deficiency.\n\nThe *COX6B1* gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive primary mitochondrial disease in 2008 (PMID: 18499082). While various names have been given to the constellation of features seen in those with *COX6B1*-related disease, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *COX6B1* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included three unique variants, each present in the homozygous state in three cases from three publications (PMIDs: 18499082, 22277967, 24781756). No segregation data were available. Loss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease association is also supported by known biochemical function, expression, functional alteration in non-patient cells, rescue in patient cells, and model systems (PMIDs: 18499082, 24781756, 34937540). \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support this gene-disease relationship, including that more than three years have elapsed since the first proposal of the association. This classification was approved by NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on March 21, 2022 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/750d78a6-6571-4a11-94b8-f63e83abe817","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bc374fc3-050b-4985-9f2f-a2972bb795fe","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bc374fc3-050b-4985-9f2f-a2972bb795fe_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2022-03-21T04:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bc374fc3-050b-4985-9f2f-a2972bb795fe_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2022-10-11T21:53:23.689Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bc374fc3-050b-4985-9f2f-a2972bb795fe_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/296350ba-55bc-4bd1-8a60-e80269f4963c_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/296350ba-55bc-4bd1-8a60-e80269f4963c","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24781756","rdfs:label":"Case","ageType":"AgeAtDeath","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":30,"allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e83209c8-da15-444e-a6a3-eeb95b3d0851","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001863.5(COX6B1):c.58C>T
