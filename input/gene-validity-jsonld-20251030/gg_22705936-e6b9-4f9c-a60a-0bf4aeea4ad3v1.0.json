Isovaleric acidemia (IVA) is an inborn error of leucine metabolism characterized by an accumulation of isovaleryl-CoA derivatives in cells, blood and urine. Clinical presentation varies widely from acute neonatal to chronic intermittent and can be detected by newborn screening. Variation in IBD were first identified in humans with the disease as early as 1985 (Ikeda et al., PMID 3863140). To date, over 50 unique variants (missense, nonsense, frameshift, splicing) have been reported (Sakamoto et al., 2015; PMID 26018748). This gene-disease relationship is supported by biochemical assays, in vitro assays, and a mouse model. In summary, IVD is definitively associated with autosomal recessive isovaleric acedmia. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/22705936-e6b9-4f9c-a60a-0bf4aeea4ad3","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/05f5d468-2f46-44f3-ba67-c4e708d2954f","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/05f5d468-2f46-44f3-ba67-c4e708d2954f_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10011","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/05f5d468-2f46-44f3-ba67-c4e708d2954f_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10011","date":"2019-05-10T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/05f5d468-2f46-44f3-ba67-c4e708d2954f_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/05f5d468-2f46-44f3-ba67-c4e708d2954f_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f22d48a8-0a8f-45e4-8a89-c31e9b4b3697","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The defect was mild and this is an inbred mouse strain so other factors could contribute to a metabolic defect.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1f1d6527-ed48-492d-930d-ca1c7b1a675b","type":"Finding","dc:description":"The 129S2/SvPasCrl inbred mouse strain has a mild elevation of C5-carnitine in plasma.
