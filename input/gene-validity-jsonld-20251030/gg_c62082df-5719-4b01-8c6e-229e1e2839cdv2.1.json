Twelve variants (including missense, in-frame deletions, nonsense, splicing, and frameshift) have been reported in 13 probands, and three additional family members, in seven publications (PMIDs: 30061063, 30982706, 25058219, 30311138, 27259049, 31392824, 30427553). This gene-disease association is also supported by experimental evidence including its biochemical function in catalysis of FMN into FAD (PMID: 16643857), which is altered in patient cells (PMID: 27259049), as well as an expression pattern consistent with disease (PMID: 20060505), and a C. elegans model (PMID: 22306247). In summary, FLAD1 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive myopathy with abnormal lipid metabolism.\nThis classification was approved by the ClinGen FAO GCEP 12/16/2020 (SOP Version [7]).\nThis gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the FAO GCEP on 06/12/2018.  It was reevaluated on 12/15/2020.  Additional genetic evidence was included from new publications (PMIDs: 30061063, 30982706, 30311138, 31392824, 30427553).
