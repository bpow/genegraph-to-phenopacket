Furthermore, the pro bands parents were negative for the mutation, although they both developed T2D in old age (64 yo for father and 76 yo for the mother). Haplotype analysis indicated that the mutation occurred de novo on the maternal allele and thus the analysis also confirmed maternity and paternity. Therefore I have increased the score to maximum.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ea6cc6ce-d94b-491f-9eac-046a718f2894"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADDeNovoCriteria","strengthScore":3}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalDominantDeNovoVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":3}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2f6d71c6-6595-49bf-a50e-fce726b22088_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2f6d71c6-6595-49bf-a50e-fce726b22088_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b4f338c7-e8e5-4171-9e52-17fec998f1a8","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b362833e-acc2-4f58-bbbf-afa7d34a67fa","type":"Finding","dc:description":"NCBI gene evidence from HPA RNA-seq of normal tissues show the highest expression of HNF1A in the kidney, duodenum, small intestine, liver, colon, and pancreas.
