{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3d5a0afe-80d1-44e3-bde0-1eae33112f69v1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"The *HMGA2* (high mobility AT-hook 2) gene located on chromosome 12 at 12q14.3 encodes a encodes a member of the non-histone chromosomal high mobility group (HMG) protein family – architectural factors and essential components of the enhanceosome. Loss of Hmga2 was first reported to be associated with growth restriction in mice (Zhou et al 1995, PMID: 7651535) and microdeletions of 12q had also implicated *HMGA2* as a cause of Silver Russell Syndrome (SRS) (OMIM:618908) (Spengler et al., 2010, PMID: 19762329). SRS diagnosis is based on the Netchine-Harbison clinical scoring system (NH-CSS) from Azzi et al. 2015 (PMID: 25951829) Suggestive findings include intrauterine growth restriction, feeding difficulties in early childhood, and postnatal growth failure. Dysmorphic features include triangular face with frontal bossing or prominent forehead, micrognathia, and relative macrocephaly at birth. Skeletal features include fifth finger clinodactyly and/or small hands. Other findings include high pitched voice, developmental delay, and genitourinary abnormalities (Saal et al., 2025, PMID: 20301499). \n\n9 unique variants from 9 individuals in 5 publications including splice  (Gorbenko del Blanco et al., 2011, PMID: ​21803798; de Crescenzo et al., 2015, PMID: 25809938), frameshift (Yamoto et a.,l 2024, PMID: 38840187; Maharaj et al., 2024, PMID: 38516887), nonsense and missense variants (PMID: 38516887) have been reported and are included in this curation . Variants in *HMGA2* have been observed to segregate with SRS in families (PMID: 25809938) and also occur de novo (Zhang et al., 2025, PMID: 40393763). More genetic evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached.The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss of function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence including functional alteration of patient cells (PMID: ​21803798) and expression in relevant tissues (Zhou et al., 1995, PMID: 7651535). Several homozygous and heterozygous knockout and knock-in animal models recapitulate growth, cranial, and genitourinary dysmorphology (PMID: 7651535; Lee et al., 2022, PMID: 34878116; PMID: 38516887). \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *HMGA2* and AD SRS. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Syndromic Disorders GCEP on the meeting date June 20th, 2025 (SOP Version 11). The ClinGen preferred term for this condition is *HMGA2*-related Silver-Russell-like syndrome.\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3d5a0afe-80d1-44e3-bde0-1eae33112f69","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/787996f0-15fe-4c59-856a-119c792e9674","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/787996f0-15fe-4c59-856a-119c792e9674_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10060","date":"2025-06-30T16:01:38.460Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/787996f0-15fe-4c59-856a-119c792e9674_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10060","date":"2025-06-20T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/787996f0-15fe-4c59-856a-119c792e9674_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e067b11a-08db-41fa-ba09-a4e377592230","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e067b11a-08db-41fa-ba09-a4e377592230_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38840187","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e9b39e05-648e-4195-bde3-87065f47e400","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_003483.6(HMGA2):c.138_141delinsCT

Figure 3. Minigene splicing assay. (a) Structure of the minigene into the RHCglo plasmid and sequences of the HMGA2 gene analyzed in this study. The minigene exons are shown as orange boxes. The two alternative splice variants are also shown: (a) derived from the removal of intron I and II and the junction of exon 1, 2 and 3; (b) derived from the removal of intron I, exon 2 and intron II, and the junction of exon 1 with exon 3. The primers used for RT–PCR are indicated by arrows. The wild-type (wt) and mutant (ΔA, ΔB and ΔC) sequences were inserted between the SalI and BamHI sites. The wt insert includes the last 45 nucleotides of the HMGA2 intron 4, the ΔA insert includes the same sequence of wt without the last 7 nucleotides, the ΔB insert includes the same sequence of ΔA plus the first 3 nucleotides of exon 5 and the ΔC insert includes the same sequence of ΔA plus the first 15 nucleotides of exon 5. The acceptor dinucleotides AG of intron IV are in green, while the putative alternative acceptor dinucleotides of exon 5 are in blue and underlined. (b) Gel electrophoresis of RT–PCR products obtained from NIH3T3 cells transfected with the minigene constructs. The 111 bp fragment corresponding to the splice variant (a); The 79 bp band corresponds to the alternative splice variant (b). Fragments with lower mobility correspond to incorrectly spliced transcripts. Cells transfected with the original RHCglo plasmid and untransfected cells (NT) were analyzed as controls. Note that the correctly spliced transcript is generated by the wt but not by the mutant constructs.
