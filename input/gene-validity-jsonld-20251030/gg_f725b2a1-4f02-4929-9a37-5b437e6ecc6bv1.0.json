A single heterozygous missense variant in this gene has been reported in the literature to cause Fanconi renotubular syndrome 3.\n\n*EHHADH* was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant Fanconi renotubular syndrome 3 in 2014. (Klootwijk et al, PMID: 24401050). To the best of our knowledge, this is the only report of a genetic defect in *EHHADH* identified in a family with the disease. \n   \nSummary of Case Level Data (2.5 points):\nA heterozygous missense variant has been reported in 1 family with nine affected individuals in 2 publications (PMIDs: 24401050, 1627757). Functional evidence shows that this primarily peroxisomal protein is mistargeted to the mitochondria as the variant, Glu3Lys, creates a mitochondrial-targeting signal and interferes with mitochondrial function by interacting with the mitochondrial trifunctional protein (PMID: 24401050, 27160910). The mechanism for disease is expected to be dominant negative.  \n  \nSummary of experimental data (1 point):\nThis gene-disease association is supported by limited experimental evidence. The *EHHADH* protein is shown to be expressed in the renal proximal tubules, which are tissues relevant to the disease (PMIDs: 24401050, 10336479). In addition, experiments with the variant expressed in proximal tubular cells show functional impairment and confirm mistargeting of the protein to the mitochondria (PMIDs: 24401050, 10336479).   \n  \nIn summary, there is limited evidence to support the gene-disease relationship of *EHHADH* and Fanconi renotubular syndrome 3. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f725b2a1-4f02-4929-9a37-5b437e6ecc6b","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f938d7bc-f717-438c-bc27-962ba62dde93","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f938d7bc-f717-438c-bc27-962ba62dde93_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10049","date":"2023-03-03T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f938d7bc-f717-438c-bc27-962ba62dde93_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10049","date":"2023-03-03T20:25:43.090Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f938d7bc-f717-438c-bc27-962ba62dde93_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f938d7bc-f717-438c-bc27-962ba62dde93_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b40d25e8-8896-4a93-b932-a6efaa135ed4","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The lack of recapitulation of the human phenotype in the knock-out mouse led the authors to conclude that haploinsufficiency is unlikely to be the underlying mechanism of disease and that the mechanism could be dominant negative.
