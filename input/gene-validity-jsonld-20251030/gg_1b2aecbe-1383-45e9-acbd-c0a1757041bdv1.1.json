GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase catalyzes the first step of the formation of mannose 6-phosphate (M6P) on specific soluble lysosomal hydrolases. M6P is essential for the trafficking of these lysosomal enzymes from the trans-Golgi network to the lysosomes via M6P receptors. Without M6P, newly synthesized lysosomal enzymes are missorted into the extracellular space and are unable to breakdown specific substrates in lysosomes (for reviews, see Velho et al, 2019, PMID: 30882951; and Khan and Tomatsu, 2020, PMID: 32957425). As a result, various macromolecules accumulate in the lysosomes in different tissues causing the characteristic symptoms of mucolipidosis. \n\nBiallelic variants in GNPTG are reported in individuals with mucolipiosis type III gamma. This condition is characterized by gradual mild coarsening of facial features, spinal deformities including scoliosis and hyperlordosis, genu valgum, restricted joint mobility, short stature, and characteristic radiographic findings. Most patients have normal intellectual capacity, and organomegaly is not present. Mucolipidosis type II gamma is typically milder and less rapidly progressive than mucolipidosis type II, which is caused by variants in GNPTAB (Raas-Rothschild & Spiegel, 2019, PMID: 20301784).\n\nAbout 50 different GNPTG variants have been identified in individuals with mucolipiosis type III gamma, about 80% of which result in formation of a premature stop codon (Velho et al, 2019, PMID: 30882951). The mechanism of pathogenicity is loss of function. Seventeen variants (including nonsense, frameshift, splice site, missense, in-frame deletion) reported in 12 probands in 4 publications (Raas-Rothschild et al, 2000, PMID: 10712439; Raas-Rothschild et al, 2004, PMID: 15060128; Persichetti et al, 2009, PMID: 19370764; Velho et al, 2014, PMID: 27896079) are included in this curation in addition to segregation data from a large, consanguineous family (Raas-Rothschild et al, 2000, PMID: 10712439). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. \nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by the biochemical function of the gene product, which is consistent with the biochemical and clinical features of mucolipidosis type III gamma (Lee et al, 2007, PMID: 17652091; Di Lorenzo et al, 2018, PMID: 29773673), rescue in patient cells (Zarghooni et al, 2009, PMID: 19938078), and the features reported in Gnptg knock out mouse and zebrafish models (Vogel et al, 2009, PMID: 19261645; Idol et al, 2014, PMID: 25314316; Flannagan-Steet et al, 2016, PMID: 27241848). \n\nIn summary, GNPTG is definitively associated with autosomal recessive GNPTG-mucolipidosis. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Lysosomal Diseases GCEP (SOP v9) on December 28, 2022.\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1b2aecbe-1383-45e9-acbd-c0a1757041bd","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/71d1d916-4c96-4d09-a66b-1c7ccb55c353","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/71d1d916-4c96-4d09-a66b-1c7ccb55c353_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10110","date":"2023-06-26T15:54:24.748Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/71d1d916-4c96-4d09-a66b-1c7ccb55c353_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10110","date":"2022-12-28T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/71d1d916-4c96-4d09-a66b-1c7ccb55c353_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/83649b23-68bd-4223-a59a-4fef75f58c56_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/83649b23-68bd-4223-a59a-4fef75f58c56","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15060128","rdfs:label":"Raas-Rothschild 2004: Individual 5-1","ageType":"AgeAtDiagnosis","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":6,"allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/273dcf0f-fdff-4fbf-a4b9-603c292aa7e8","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_032520.5(GNPTG):c.608dup (p.His205ProfsTer2)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA2573332335"}},"detectionMethod":"Sequence analysis of the 11 exons of GNPTG and exon/intron boundaries.","firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypeFreeText":"Stifness/join limitation of elbows, wrists and shoulders.\nJoint limitation in hands or claw hands.

only a partial loss of lysosomal enzyme phosphorylation while loss of the alpha/beta subunits decreased phosphorylation of lysosomal acid hydrolases to undetectable levels. This suggests that the alpha/beta subunits, which contain the catalytic site of the enzyme, are able to recognize lysosomal acid hydrolases as specific substrates in the absence of the gamma-subunit, although not nearly as efficiently as the holoenzyme, showing that the gamma subunit (GNPTG) facilitates substrate recognition.\n","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17652091","rdfs:label":"M6P addition to lysosomal hydrolases in Gnptg KO mouse cells","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f471ceed-e387-4b20-8921-f4f1ade13760","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The score is increased due to the multiple experiments supporting the role of GNPTG, and consistency with the findings in patients with ML III.

Tagging with M6P is a two-step process, initiated by N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc)-1- phosphotransferase. However, the specific role of GNPTG was not well understood.\nIn this paper, through a series of experiments in Gnptg knock out mouse embryoic fibroblasts (outlined above) the authors show that deficiency of the gamma-subunit of GlcNAc-1- phosphotransferase results in the decreased intracellular activities and amounts of various lysosomal enzymes (arylsulfatase B, beta-hexosaminidase A/B, beta-galactosidase, beta-mannosidase, and beta-fucosidase), decreased GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase activity, reduced amounts and altered pattern of M6P-containing proteins in cell extracts and lysosome-enriched fractions, and specifically that that loss of alpha-L-fucosidase and arylsulfatase B activity resulted in accumulation of storage of L-fucose- containing glycostructures and sulfated glycosaminoglycans in Gnptg KO MEF. In short, the gamma-subunit of (GlcNAc)-1- phosphotransferase, enoded by GNPTG, is required for the lysosomal targeting of multiple soluble lysosomal proteins. Without this activity, various macromolecules build up in the lysosomes, resulting in the clinical symptoms observed in patients with ML III.
