Variants in ATP7B were first reported in humans with this disease as early as 1993 (Bull et al., PMID 8298639). Wilson disease is a disorder of copper metabolism characterized by an accumulation of copper in many organs, particularly the liver and brain. At least 700 unique germline variants have been identified (missense, nonsense, splice site, frameshift) (reviewed in Członkowska et al., 2018; PMID 30190489). This gene-disease relationship is well-known and therefore a significant amount of case-level data, segregation data and experimental data is available in the literature, therefore the maximum score for both genetic evidence and experimental evidence has been reached. Note, this curation effort may not be exhaustive of all literature related to this gene-disease relationship. The mutational mechanism for disease is loss of function leading to reduced (or absent) copper-transporter activity (Huster et al., 2012; PMID 22240481). This gene-disease association is supported by expression studies, in vitro functional assays, and animal models. In summary, ATP7B is definitively associated with autosomal recessive Wilson disease. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen General Gene Curation Expert Panel on March 27, 2019.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/23d81ec0-f1a1-4556-9cb0-31c89f1f0fc4","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f0ac0a41-d7d5-4377-a622-1ee9bc4ed9f3","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f0ac0a41-d7d5-4377-a622-1ee9bc4ed9f3_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10026","date":"2019-03-27T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f0ac0a41-d7d5-4377-a622-1ee9bc4ed9f3_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10026","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f0ac0a41-d7d5-4377-a622-1ee9bc4ed9f3_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f0ac0a41-d7d5-4377-a622-1ee9bc4ed9f3_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/79663807-d7fc-4753-a53d-f45a8608236c","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1eae3ada-1d39-435e-94cc-45dd2a8a6d1c","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Introduced an early termination codon in the mouse ATP7B mRNA by substituting a portion of exon 2 with a neomycin cassette oriented in the opposite frame.

Liver tissue copper was highly elevated (19.5 µmol/g dry liver, normal level: below 0.87 µmol/g).","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/67686dff-01ac-4c6a-9027-748223eab7a2_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16635921","allele":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e0a9ffa3-1e00-4ec7-a325-35d1542d0664","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000053.3(ATP7B):c.4051C>T (p.Gln1351Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/188947"}},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/97699e91-f185-4010-b763-467e1f852518"}]}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/893b3fe3-1e84-4cfe-8425-714064769df8_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Common variant in Wilson Disease (founder).
