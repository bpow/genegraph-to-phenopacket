{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c831a04b-3b5a-4232-b0f6-4db8d060eea8v1.1","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"The relationship between *CAV3* and caveolinopathy, inherited in the autosomal dominant pattern, has been evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of July, 2022. This association was made using case-level, segregation, and experimental data. The *CAV3* gene is located on chromosome 3p25.3. The MANE SELECT transcript (NM_033337.3) is 1422 bp long with 2 exons encoding a 151-amino acid protein. More than 50 pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants reported in humans with clinical phenotypes that form the caveolinopathy spectrum are recorded in ClinVar, most of them being missense variants. Since the gene has only 2 exons, predicted loss of function variants are not expected to cause nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. Patients with caveolinopathy show variable clinical features including, but not limited to, proximal muscle weakness, exercise-induce muscle fatigue, increased serum creatine kinase levels, percussion-induced rapid rolling muscle contractions and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). *CAV3* has been reported in association with caveoliopathy as early as 1998 (Minetti et al, PMID: 9537420, Betz et al, PMID: 11431690, McNally et al, PMID: 9536092). \n\nSummary of Case Level Data (12 points): The association is seen in at least 11 probands in 6 publications (PMID: 9537420, 11431690, 19773168, 14672715, 26947586, 12082049). Variants in the gene segregated with disease in at least 7 additional family members. More case-level evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts) has been reached.\n\nThe mechanism for disease is expected to be dominant negative. \n\nSummary of Experimental Data (6 points): This gene-disease relationship is supported by animal models, expression studies, and protein interaction assays. *CAV3* encodes the caveolin 3 protein that functions as a scaffolding protein for organizing and concentrating certain caveolin-interacting molecules. Caveolin 3 is expressed specifically in the skeletal and cardiac muscle tissues ( PMID: 11259414, 9536092, 9537420). Caveolin 3 associates with the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex and changes in its expression lead to the disruption of the DGC and to downregulation of dystrophin protein levels (PMID: 9536092, 19584897). The CAV3 knock-out and the P105L transgenic mouse models sufficiently recapitulate the human caveolinopathy features, such as limb girdle weakness and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.\n\nIn summary, the *CAV3*-autosomal dominant caveolinopathy gene-disease relationship is definitive. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. \n\nOMIM entities: Familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; elevated serum creatine phosphokinase, long QT syndrome 9, Tateyama type distal myopathy, rippling muscle disease 2. \n\nPer criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no significant difference in phenotype, inheritance pattern OR molecular mechanism in the above-mentioned disease entities. Therefore, all the entities have been lumped under caveolinopathy.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c831a04b-3b5a-4232-b0f6-4db8d060eea8","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a314687e-b35d-4bb4-8b93-efcc83d1fa9b","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":[{"id":"cg:sopChange"},{"id":"cg:expertPanelChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a314687e-b35d-4bb4-8b93-efcc83d1fa9b_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10151","date":"2022-09-13T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a314687e-b35d-4bb4-8b93-efcc83d1fa9b_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10151","date":"2023-11-02T19:08:51.465Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["ErrorClarification"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a314687e-b35d-4bb4-8b93-efcc83d1fa9b_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a314687e-b35d-4bb4-8b93-efcc83d1fa9b_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fcfc338d-1903-4414-8d34-d8477d0b3e3b","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Score is increased for restricted expression of CAV3 in skeletal and cardiac muscle tissue.","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ab2d138a-0b8c-4aba-bba3-04c683fb9eea","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Western blot analysis of CAV3 protein in mouse tissues revealed restricted expression to mouse skeletal muscle and heart (Figure 2A).
