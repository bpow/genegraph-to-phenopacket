{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d17d520d-59e8-436f-ae6f-2955cc022185v1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"The relationship between LIAS and Leigh syndrome spectrum was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of September 21, 2020. The LIAS gene encodes lipoic acid synthase, an enzyme important for the synthesis of lipoic acid, which is a cofactor of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC). PDC catalyzes conversion of pyruvate into acetyl-CoA, thus is the link between glycolysis and the citric acid cycle. PDC deficiency leads to impaired energy metabolism.\n\nThe LIAS gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Leigh syndrome spectrum in 2014 (PMID: 24334290). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included four variants identified in three cases from three publications (PMID: 24334290, 28817111,\n26108146). Of note, of five cases reported to date, three had features consistent with Leigh syndrome spectrum. No segregation data were available. Loss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease association is also supported by biochemical function, expression, and animal models (PMIDs: 11389890,\n25613900, 16135825).\n\nIn summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on September 21, 2020 (SOP Version 7).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d17d520d-59e8-436f-ae6f-2955cc022185","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ec6f6c96-262d-4ab8-ab7a-b09d585689ca","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ec6f6c96-262d-4ab8-ab7a-b09d585689ca_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2021-03-11T17:19:48.675Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ec6f6c96-262d-4ab8-ab7a-b09d585689ca_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2021-03-11T17:19:36.261Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ec6f6c96-262d-4ab8-ab7a-b09d585689ca_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b8e98580-28eb-4dbc-85e0-65aede371f7b_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"c.738-2A>G and c.929T>C (p.Met310Thr) confirmed in trans via parental testing","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/45ebd376-40d6-4879-9866-40c8a2c0d4ed","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26108146","rdfs:label":"Tsurusaki Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":19,"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"Following illness at 19 mos, showed chorea-like involuntary movements; consistent high blood and CSF glycine levels; Brain MRI (age 2) showed high-intensity areas at the caudate nucleus and the putamen, which spread into the deep white matter (Images available for review).
