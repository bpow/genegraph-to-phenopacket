The NDUFAF6 gene encodes NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) assembly factor 6. Defects of this protein lead to a complex I deficiency.\n\nThe NDUFAF6 gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Leigh syndrome spectrum in 2008 (PMID: 18614015). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included eight unique variants identified in seven cases from seven publications (PMIDs: 18614015, 30642748, 29531337, 27623250, 28639102, 31967322, 32020600). Segregation data includes 3 affected individuals from one kindred (PMID: 30642748). Loss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease association is also supported by biochemical function, expression data, and rescue in patient cells (PMIDs: 22019594, 25613900, 26741492).\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support this gene-disease relationship, including that more than three years have elapsed from the first proposal of the association. This classification was approved by the NICHD U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on April 20, 2020 (SOP Version 7).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/47f7ed11-9de4-4237-926d-075323e99c1a","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f7b6ace1-5b89-41c7-83a6-d6f37826d8c5","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f7b6ace1-5b89-41c7-83a6-d6f37826d8c5_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2020-11-23T19:42:12.660Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f7b6ace1-5b89-41c7-83a6-d6f37826d8c5_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2020-11-23T19:42:44.032Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f7b6ace1-5b89-41c7-83a6-d6f37826d8c5_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/428dda4d-d7d1-4675-9d2f-0e014de73792_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"(c.532G>C:p.A178P) and deep intronic (c.420+784C>T) noted in multiple individuals. this corresponded to alternative splicing isoforms retaining an extra 124 nucleotide-long exon (exon 3b; Fig. 1B) and predicted to undergo premature non-sense mediated decay on public databases, because of the creation of a premature stop codon.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a11376c2-8613-414a-842a-fc78aa7cac6b","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29531337","rdfs:label":"Catania Patient A1","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":21,"detectionMethod":"","phenotypeFreeText":"At 30 mos, Brain MRI at onset disclosed slight bilateral T2-hyperintensities in putamina, dentate nuclei and superior cerebellar peduncles.
