A homozygous deletion upstream of SLC9A9 (also known as NHE9) as well as several heterozygous variants (one nonsense and several missense) were reported in this gene; the sequence variants were later found to have high population frequencies in gnomAD. According to gnomAD (v.2.1.1), SLC9A9 is not constrained for loss of function variants (pLI=0) or missense variants (z-score=-0.25). Previously, a pericentric inversion of chromosome 3 disrupting SLC9A9 was reported in an extended pedigree with intellectual disability and behavioral problems (PMID: 14569117). The other inversion breakpoint affected DOCK3, a brain-expressed gene involved in neurodevelopmental disorders, and the inversion did not always segregate with the phenotype, therefore this family was not scored. An inherited exonic deletion of SLC9A9 in an individual with autism spectrum disorder and epilepsy (PMID: 27123481), and two nonsense variants in individuals with autism spectrum disorder, including one reported several times in gnomAD (PMID: 26185613), were also not scored. As of March 2020, there is no valid human evidence supporting a role of SLC9A9 in autism spectrum disorder. As such, we did not score any functional evidence. Genetic evidence: 0 points. Experimental evidence: 0 points. In summary, the evidence supporting the relationship between SLC9A9 and autosomal dominant autism spectrum disorder is disputed. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel on 10/08/2020.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e5df2f5f-7a3c-48cf-a2cc-260485af7003","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/463ee005-1264-45da-bd85-3776a6637c68","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"NoKnownDiseaseRelationship","changes":{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/463ee005-1264-45da-bd85-3776a6637c68_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2020-10-08T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/14083ba8-25ff-4e10-bd27-6a5470d79f0c_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2021-11-15T19:03:21.968Z","role":"Unpublisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/463ee005-1264-45da-bd85-3776a6637c68_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2021-11-15T19:03:21.968Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"As of October 2020, there is no valid human evidence supporting a role of SLC9A9 in autism spectrum disorder.
