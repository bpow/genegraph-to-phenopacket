{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a483977d-70b2-4d89-8bb9-20a540dabb19v3.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"The *GAS2L2* gene was first reported in relation to primary ciliary dyskinesia in 2019 (Bustamante-Marin et al., PMID: 30665704). The specific disease entity, primary ciliary dyskinesia 41 (MONDO:0032757, OMIM #618449), is one of at least 45 different primary ciliary dyskinesias distinguished by a single monogenic cause. Affected patients can have childhood onset of symptoms or can be diagnosed as late as in the 6th decade of life (PMID: 36104176, PMID: 30665704). Consistent features among the limited number of well-characterized patients are sinusitis, otitis media, and bronchiectasis. Low nasal nitric oxide levels are observed in some patients, but not others. Adult patients can exhibit infertility. While neonatal respiratory distress and heterotaxy have not been found among the limited number of well-characterized patients, establishing the presence or absence of these symptoms in the patient population will require the emergence and characterization of additional affected individuals (PMID: 30665704). Biopsies of the airway epithelium show cilia with normal axonemal ultrastructure but hyperkinetic beat frequency with a normal waveform. Basal body orientation is disrupted, causing a lack of coordinated directionality of beating among the cilia of each cell. This curation has scored three suspected disease-causing *GAS2L2* variants (two frameshift and one missense), which were reported in two homozygous probands and one compound heterozygous proband in two publications (PMID: 30665704, PMID: 36104176). One of the variants consists of an approximately 4-kilobase deletion affecting not only *GAS2L2* but also a region within the adjacent *RASL10B* locus encoding part of the 3’UTR. The molecular mechanism appears to be biallelic loss of function with an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance, characterized in at least some cases by variants predicted to trigger the absence of a gene product. Please note that the limited number of patients and functional assays available has so far precluded a more thorough analysis of molecular mechanism, and an urgent need remains for additional published cases.\n\nThis gene-disease association is also supported by experimental evidence that human and mouse tissues exhibiting the highest levels of *GAS2L2* expression include tissue types relevant to disease and known to have motile cilia, including the fallopian tube, lung, brain, and testis (PMID: 30665704, PMID: 23715323). Within the airway epithelium, the GAS2L2 protein exhibits strong subcellular localization to the base of the cilia and co-localizes with basal body markers (PMID: 30665704). Additional biochemical studies have demonstrated that GAS2L2 interacts through its C-terminal region with microtubule plus ends and with the microtubule plus end-associated protein EB1 (PMID: 24706950, PMID: 22885064, PMID: 12584248). When exogenously expressed, GAS2L2 stabilizes microtubule length (PMID: 24706950) and can promote microtubule bundling (PMID:12584248). The C-terminus of GAS2L2 also interacts with actin microfilaments (PMID: 12584248), including in ciliated cells (PMID: 30665704), consistent with a function in coordinating consistent ciliary basal body orientation relative to the actin cytoskeleton. While GAS2L2 can also interact with the G-protein-coupled A2A adenosine receptor and enhance its adenylate cyclase (cAMP-producing) activity (PMID: 23994616), it is not yet clear whether this function occurs in cell types with motile cilia or to what degree it impacts ciliary beat frequency. Phenotypes of affected human patients are recapitulated by various model organisms with *GAS2L2* loss-of-function, including *Xenopus laevis* embryos and knockout mice. Silencing of two genes orthologous to *GAS2L2* in *Xenopus laevis* embryos recapitulates the human patient phenotype of disoriented ciliary beat directionality and can be rescued by co-injection of human *GAS2L2* mRNA (PMID: 30665704, PMID: 36878953). Respiratory epithelial cells from *Gas2l2* knockout mice recapitulate the human patient features of hyperkinetic ciliary beat frequency, misalignment of basal feet, and disorientation of the ciliary beating pattern in each cell, while exhibiting the additional phenotypes of situs ambiguus and high neonatal mortality (PMID: 30665704). A conditional *Gas2l2* knockout model further shows impaired mucociliary clearance (PMID: 30665704).\n\nIn summary, the evidence linking *GAS2L2* with primary ciliary dyskinesia 41 has reached a score in the moderate range. This association has been repeatedly demonstrated in both research and diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time without the emergence of contradictory evidence, leading to a Moderate classification. Additional genetic evidence will be required to reach a more definitive gene-disease association. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Motile Ciliopathy GCEP on September 14th, 2023 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a483977d-70b2-4d89-8bb9-20a540dabb19","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/91afae37-4cfc-4aeb-af0f-26a9596611f3","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","changes":[{"id":"cg:classificationChange"},{"id":"cg:newEvidence"},{"id":"cg:sopChange"},{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/91afae37-4cfc-4aeb-af0f-26a9596611f3_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10102","date":"2024-01-01T04:14:05.212Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/91afae37-4cfc-4aeb-af0f-26a9596611f3_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10102","date":"2023-09-14T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["RecurationNewEvidence"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/91afae37-4cfc-4aeb-af0f-26a9596611f3_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/91afae37-4cfc-4aeb-af0f-26a9596611f3_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a90eed65-5a34-4eea-bac3-f9d5ab0e1991","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"This expression pattern is consistent with patients' lung phenotypes such as sinusitis, bronchiectasis, and otitis media, as well as the fertility issues observed in the single adult patient.","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/81799da0-610c-4814-ac85-df016a675707","type":"Finding","dc:description":"GAS2L2 mRNA expression was examined across 9 different human tissues, and primarily detected in those known to contain ciliated cells (brain, lung, testis, and fallopian tube).

It is therefore predicted to trigger NMD, and at least disrupts the C-terminal ~67% of the protein product. Scoring has been downgraded because the deletion also disrupts the adjacent locus, disrupting part of the 3'UTR of the RASL10B transcript. Some scoring was preserved since the adjacent RASL10B gene is not known to be involved in PCD.","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7b858731-464b-499b-b6cc-552bdd804a95_variant_evidence_item"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f62d827f-13b6-431f-b1f9-20f7df44d5d9_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f62d827f-13b6-431f-b1f9-20f7df44d5d9","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30665704","rdfs:label":"Bustamante-Marin_2019_Proband_PCD-1367","ageType":"AgeAtDiagnosis","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":56,"allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/abf42628-b584-43f0-b8fd-6375892f037a"},"detectionMethod":"Whole exome sequencing identified the variants in the GAS2L2 locus, which were subsequently confirmed by Sanger sequencing.","firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"Nasal nitric oxide was 342.6 nL/min.
