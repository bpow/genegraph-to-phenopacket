{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/528931a0-e090-4da1-ad0a-18c0343911e2v1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"The *CCDC32* gene is located on chromosome 15 at 15q15.1 and encodes coiled-coil domain-containing protein 32, which has a role in cephalic and left-right axis development, as well as cilia formation and maintenance. *CCDC32* was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive cardiofacioneurodevelopmental syndrome (CFNDS) in 2020 (Harel et al., PMID: 32307552). CFNDS is characterized by cardiac defects, craniofacial features including bilateral cleft lip and palate, and developmental delays. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. \n\nThree variants (including 2 frameshift variants and an intragenic deletion) that have been reported in three probands in two publications (PMIDs:32307552, 35451546) are included in this curation. An additional 21 kb deletion was reported in a fourth proband (PMID: 38818818) but was not included in this curation. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss of function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence from zebrafish models (PMID: 32307552). Zebrafish with depleted *ccdc32* display cerebellar hypoplasia, microcephaly, altered facial skeletal morphology, disrupted cardiac looping, and impaired expression of a ket left/right patterning transcript (southpaw).\n\nIn summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Syndromic Disorders GCEP on the meeting date October 18th, 2024 (SOP Version 11).\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/528931a0-e090-4da1-ad0a-18c0343911e2","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/29c6c0dd-bbaf-45ce-92af-4c67059cac8f","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/29c6c0dd-bbaf-45ce-92af-4c67059cac8f_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10060","date":"2024-10-18T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/29c6c0dd-bbaf-45ce-92af-4c67059cac8f_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10060","date":"2025-01-07T15:23:57.056Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/29c6c0dd-bbaf-45ce-92af-4c67059cac8f_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/29c6c0dd-bbaf-45ce-92af-4c67059cac8f_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/553c73b3-4227-4a69-b622-9baa0017da14","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b17dcffd-944e-454e-833b-c24ee179677e","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Organ situs, in particular cardiac looping, can be examined readily in zebrafish embryos due to their optical transparency, availability of transgenic reporters and external development. Alterations in facial skeletal morphology can be measured by the angle of the bilateral ceratohyal cartilages.

Abnormal cardiac looping and abnormal expression of southpaw provides evidence for disrupted heart development and left/right symmetry/patterning similar to the cardiac defects seen in most probands and heterotaxy seen in one proband.
