Thirteen variants (frameshift, nonsense, splice site, and missense) that have been reported in 13 probands in 2 publications (PMIDs: 15146185, 15146186) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. Variants in this gene generally occur *de novo*. The mechanism for disease is known to be loss of function. A total of 243 unique variants have been classified as Pathogenic in ClinVar, 193 of which are frameshift, nonsense or consensus splice changes.\n\nClassical CdLS features can be prenatally identified by fetal imaging; these include fetal growth restriction, limb reduction defects, hand anomalies including clinodactyly, oligodactyly, or ectrodactyly, diaphragmatic hernia, heart defects, microcephaly, and abnormal facial features including micrognathia, depressed nasal ridge, anteverted nares, long and smooth philtrum, thin upper lip and downturned corners of the mouth. Unusually long hair, synophrys with arched eyebrows and long eyelashes have been observed by two dimensional and three-dimensional ultrasound. CdLS can be prenatally suspected with any combination of fetal growth restriction, limb defects, facial abnormalities, heart defects, or diaphragmatic hernia (PMIDs: 19242925, 24218399, 24918291, 29995837, 30890023, 33478103, 33633789, 34394191, 35506482).\n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by expression, protein interactions and animal models that recapitulate the human disease.\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between *NIPBL* and autosomal dominant Cornelia de Lange syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This relationship was evaluated by the Intellectual Disability and Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel on June 20, 2018 (SOP 5) and by the Prenatal Gene Curation Expert Panel on June 28, 2023 (SOP 9).\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b865e2b3-a7ef-4cb9-a342-bb2192df8183","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d4ecc430-6562-4d58-9118-c5253dc95ae9","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10106","role":"SecondaryContributor"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d4ecc430-6562-4d58-9118-c5253dc95ae9_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2024-04-02T21:44:33.509Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d4ecc430-6562-4d58-9118-c5253dc95ae9_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2023-06-28T06:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["ErrorClarification"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d4ecc430-6562-4d58-9118-c5253dc95ae9_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d4ecc430-6562-4d58-9118-c5253dc95ae9_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2b239b83-62e5-449b-a5ff-871400b62a8f","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6581661f-0f63-4346-990a-26b0e1715cbd","type":"Finding","dc:description":"The observed expression pattern was largely consistent with the CdLS\nphenotype (Figs. 3 and 4). NIPBL was expressed in developing limbs\n(Fig. 3a,b) and later in cartilage primordia of the ulna and of various\nhand bones (Fig. 4c). Sites of craniofacial expression included the\ncartilage primordium of the basioccipital and basisphenoid skull\nbones (Figs. 3a and 4f) and elsewhere in the head and face, including\na region encompassing the mesenchyme adjacent to the cochlear\ncanal (Fig. 4e,f). NIPBL was also expressed in the spinal column, notochord and surface\nectoderm (Figs. 3a,b and 4b), sclerotome and what seem to be\nmigrating myoblasts (Fig. 3b). Expression in the developing heart was\npronounced in the atrial and ventricular myocardium and in the ventricular\ntubeculae but absent in the endocardial cushions (Fig. 3a,b).\nNIPBL was also expressed in the developing esophagus, trachea and\nmidgut loops (Fig. 3a), in the bronchi of the lung (Figs. 3b and 4d)\nand in the tubules of the metanephros (Fig. 4a).\nExpression in organs and tissues not typically affected in CdLS (e.g.,\nthe developing trachea, bronchi, esophagus, heart and kidney) may\nreflect a bias towards underreporting of more subtle aspects of the\nphenotype or problems that typically present later in life. Respiratory\nand feeding difficulties and gastroesophageal reflux are known CdLS\ncomplications, individuals with CdLS have a greater incidence of\ncongenital heart abnormalities, and renal abnormalities can be\nfound in >50% of classical cases (A. Selicorni, personal communication).\nExpression in the mesenchyme surrounding the cochlear canal\n(Fig. 4e) may be related to the hearing impairment commonly found\nin CdLS17.
