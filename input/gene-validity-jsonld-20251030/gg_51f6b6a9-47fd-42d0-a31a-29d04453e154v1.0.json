Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found differences in phenotypic variability. Therefore, the following disease entities have been split into eight disease entities, osteogenesis imperfecta, type I (OMIM:166200), osteogenesis imperfecta, type II (OMIM:166210), osteogenesis imperfecta, type III (OMIM:259420), osteogenesis imperfecta, type IV (OMIM:166220), Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, arthrochalasia type, 1 (OMIM:130060), combined osteogenesis imperfecta and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome 1 (OMIM:619115), Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, classic type, 1 (not associated with COL1A1 in OMIM), and Caffey disease (OMIM:114000). The split curations have been curated separately. Twelve variants (missense and in-frame insertion-deletion) that have been reported in twelve probands in five publications (PMIDs: 2745420, 8456809, 9007315, 17078022, 35113812) are included in this curation meeting phenotypic criteria including short stature, fragile bones that fracture easily (before puberty), mild-moderate bone malformations, wormian bones, scoliosis/kyphosis, bowed limbs straighten with age, triangular face (some cases), hearing loss, otosclerosis, normal sclerae (common), and dentinogenesis imperfecta. Glycine substitutions in *COL1A1* affect the triple helix structure formed by the pro-alpha 1(I) chains encoded by *COL1A1* and the pro-alpha 2(I) chain encoded by *COL2A1*, and ultimately disrupt the function of type 1 collagen. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by mouse models recapitulating the human phenotype and molecular mechanism as well as functional alteration in patient cells (PMIDs: 3759085, 10608859, 15246109, 23802117). In summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *COL1A1* and autosomal dominant osteogenesis imperfecta type IV. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Skeletal Disorders GCEP on the meeting date June 6, 2022 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/51f6b6a9-47fd-42d0-a31a-29d04453e154","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ce1c11be-7ead-43b5-a94d-665bf0111814","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ce1c11be-7ead-43b5-a94d-665bf0111814_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10065","date":"2023-09-28T19:05:14.433Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ce1c11be-7ead-43b5-a94d-665bf0111814_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10065","date":"2023-09-28T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["ErrorClarification"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ce1c11be-7ead-43b5-a94d-665bf0111814_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ce1c11be-7ead-43b5-a94d-665bf0111814_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5055558f-2dc8-46c5-8df5-b37988fd0a15","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Upgraded for further study on this mouse model in PMIDs: 15246109, 23802117.
