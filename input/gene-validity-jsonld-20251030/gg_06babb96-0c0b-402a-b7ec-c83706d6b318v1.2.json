The specific disease entity, congenital bile acid synthesis disorder (http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_1060107, OMIM:603711), is one of at least 6 forms of congenital bile acid synthesis defects. Some of the most common patient phenotypes are: Elevated circulating alanine aminotransferase concentration, Jaundice and one case of Prolonged neonatal jaundice, Elevated circulating aspartate aminotransferase concentration, Hepatosplenomegaly and Elevated Oxysterol Levels.\n\nCYP7B1 was first described as a spastic paraplegia-causing gene in 2008 (Tsaousidou et al. 2008, PMID: 18252231). The specific disease entity, CYP7B1-related disorder of oxysterol accumulation (http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_1060107, OMIM:603711), is one of at least 100 spastic paraplegia disorders. Some of the most common patient phenotypes are: Affected/abnormal white brain matter, Lower limb spasticity, Lower limb hyperreflexia, Babinski sign, Increased total bilirubin, Impaired vibratory sensation, Upper limb hyperreflexia, Lower limb muscle weakness, Prolonged prothrombin time, and Elevated Oxysterol Levels.\n\nPer criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping & Splitting Working Group, the mode of inheritance (autosomal recessive) and molecular mechanism (CYP7B1 loss-of-function) were found to be consistent between the congenital bile acid synthesis defect 3 cases and the spastic paraplegia 5A cases. In addition, the shared feature of elevated oxysterol levels observed in both groups of patients appeared to represent a single spectrum of disease. Therefore, cases caused by inherited CYP7B1 variants have been lumped for the purposes of gene curation into a single disease entity referred to as \"CYP7B1-related disorder of oxysterol accumulation\".\n\nThirteen variants: (4 types of genetic mutations: Nonsense (3), Missense (6), Splice Site (1) & Frameshift (3)) that have been reported in 14 probands in 13 publications (PMIDs: 9802883, 18252231, 12874406, 19187859, 19439420, 21214876, 24658845, 33849447,  24509641, 30546280, 35387662, 30333426, 21567895) are included in this curation.\n\nThe age of onset and diagnosis was highly variable among the probands. Probands with symptoms of bile acid synthesis tended to have congenital onset and require treatment whereas probands with spastic paraplegia tended to have milder, adult onset. A few probands appeared to display a combination of bile acid synthesis and spastic paraplegia phenotypes. Siblings of the probands were also found to be affected to varying degrees of severity. Some siblings were found to have symptoms of spastic paraplegia while the affected proband displayed bile acid synthesis phenotypes. There were also instances where siblings were found to have symptoms of bile acid synthesis while the affected proband displayed spastic paraplegia phenotypes.\n\nOverall, the mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss of function as shown in the types of variants harbored by the probands. \n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by multiple forms of experimental evidence such as BioChem B (Quantity: 1), Model System: Mouse (Mus musculus) (Quantity: 2) (PMIDs: 19687010, 10748048 and 31013940). First, Stiles et al. 2009 (PMID: 19687010), the affected oxysterol 7-alpha-hydroxylase activity recapitulates what is seen in the human probands. Next, Li-Hawkins et al. 2000 had a knockout mouse that showed affected oxysterol activity which recapitulates what is seen in the human probands. Meljon et al. 2019 also had a knockout mouse that showed the same phenotype (PMID: 31013940).\n\nIn conclusion, CYP7B1 is definitively associated with CYP7B1-related disorder of oxysterol accumulation. This classification has been clearly demonstrated and confirmed through both experimental and genetic evidence and has been upheld over time. \n\nThis classification was approved by the General IEM GCEP on February 28th, 2025 (SOP Version 11).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/06babb96-0c0b-402a-b7ec-c83706d6b318","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e000ae1c-93a3-4f6b-bdf0-afd04603d407","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e000ae1c-93a3-4f6b-bdf0-afd04603d407_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10097","date":"2025-02-28T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e000ae1c-93a3-4f6b-bdf0-afd04603d407_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10097","date":"2025-06-24T16:05:06.741Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["ErrorClarification"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e000ae1c-93a3-4f6b-bdf0-afd04603d407_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e000ae1c-93a3-4f6b-bdf0-afd04603d407_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/78442be5-9301-411e-ad8d-99d8dbde703d","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d86ed3f9-fd56-488b-a510-445a255490ee","type":"Finding","dc:description":"A majority of mice lacking cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase die from vitamin and caloric deficiencies in the first 18–21 days of life (13); thereafter, the expression of CYP7B1 is induced in liver, resulting in the synthesis of bile salts and the prevention of further premature death (12).

Neurological examination disclosed a pure clinical phenotype with spastic paraplegia rating scale (SPRS) values of 15/52 and 10/52 in patients 1 and 2, respectively.\n\nBrain MRI showed slight FLAIR hyper-intense signal in the periventricular and centrum ovale white matter, and spectroscopy (1H MRS) on those areas showed a mild reduction of the relative ratio N-acetyl aspartate/creatine and the presence of a small lipid peak in both patients (Fig. 1a, b). Spinal cord MRI was normal. A motor evoked potentials (MEPs) study uncovered abnormal central motor conduction times (CMCTs) from both upper and lower limbs, and electromyography was normal.

(3.52 kg). The patient’s parents were first cousins, both from the same small village in Mexico.\n\nThe proband was the second pregnancy; the first re- sulted in a healthy male infant who was 2.5 yr of age at the time the proband presented. The patient developed jaundice at 6 d of age (total serum bilirubin 18.6 mg/dl), which resolved with phototherapy. During week 6 of life he intermittently passed acholic stools; jaundice returned at 8 wk of age. At 10 wk of age, bright red blood was passed per rectum and a spontaneous episode of epistaxis occurred. The patient was then referred to the Children’s Hospital in Denver for evaluation. On physical examination, the patient was alert and icteric with height and weight between the 25th and 50th percentiles. A right scleral hemorrhage was present and nares were crusted with blood, but not actively bleeding. There were no dysmorphic features or cardiac murmur, and neurological examination was normal. The liver was firm and 3 cm below the right costal margin and the spleen tip was palpable.\n\nInitial laboratory studies revealed serum AST 440 IU/liter (normal 20–60), ALT 160 IU/liter (normal 7–46), alkaline phosphatase 1,384 IU/liter (normal 110–460), total/direct bilirubin 8.4/4.8 mg/dl (normal , 1.0), prothrombin time 41 s (normal 12.4–14.4), and blood ammonia 37 mmol/liter (normal 29–57). Serum GGT was 14 IU/liter, cholesterol was 101 mg/dl, and CBC was normal. Evaluations for viral infections, alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, hereditary tyrosinemia, cystic fibrosis, hypopituitarism, and iron storage disease were normal or negative. Serum a-tocopherol concentration was 5.5 mg/ml (normal 3.8–15.5), a-tocopherol: total serum lipids ratio was 1.07 (normal . 0.6 mg/g), serum retinol 6.0 mg/dl (normal 19–77), and retinol binding protein was 0.7 mg/dl (normal 1.0–5.0).\n\nAbdominal ultrasonography showed a small gallbladder, no choledochal cyst, no dilatation of bile ducts, and bilateral enlarged kidneys without hydronephrosis. Hepatobiliary scintigraphy with iminodiacetic acid showed delayed hepatic clearance and no biliary excretion. Parenteral vitamin K treatment led to a substantial reduction in the prothrombin time to 19.1 s. Percutaneous liver biopsy (see Results) performed after correction of coagulopathy suggested biliary tract obstruction. The patient then underwent an exploratory laparotomy which showed an enlarged, firm, green liver, a normal gallbladder containing yellow bile, and a normal biliary system was seen on an intraoperative cholangiogram performed through the gallbladder. Urine and serum were shipped to Cincinnati for evaluation of bile acid synthetic defects.\n\nThe patient was treated with a medium chain triglyceride-containing formula, fat-soluble vitamin supplementation (phytonadione, 25-hydroxy-vitamin D, D -a-tocopheryl PEG-1000 succinate), and ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA)1 at 15 mg/kg body wt/d (Fig. 1). UDCA therapy was terminated after 10 d because of a marked increase in serum bilirubin and aminotransferases. After the recognition of a defect in primary bile acid synthesis, the patient was then treated with oral cholic acid at 15 mg/kg body wt/d. There was no clinical response after 49 d of cholic acid therapy with continued deterioration of hepatic synthetic function (Fig. 1).\n\nBecause of poor weight gain, progressive hepatosplenomegaly, hypoalbuminemia, and coagulopathy, the patient underwent orthotopic liver transplantation from a cadaver donor at 4.5 mo of age. Immunosuppression included cyclosporine, corticosteroids, and azathioprine. Acute allograft rejection occurred on day 9 after transplant and responded to large intravenous corticosteroid bolus therapy. Neutropenia developed on day 10 and was followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa sepsis and ecthyma gangrenosum of the buttocks on day 15. The patient responded well to intravenous antibiotic therapy and a reduction of immunosuppression; however, on day 19 he developed sudden, rapidly progressive cerebral edema and died 24 h later. Autopsy revealed disseminated lymphoproliferative disease (Epstein-Barr virus–related) in all body tissues, including brain and liver, and mild allograft rejection.

Investigation showed an elevated alanine aminotransferase with a normal γ-glutamyl-transpeptidase. Analysis of urine by electrospray ionisation tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS) showed that the major peaks were m/z 480 (taurine-conjugated 3β-hydroxy-5-cholenoic acid) and m/z 453 (sulphated 3β-hydroxy-5-cholenoic acid). Analysis of plasma by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) showed increased concentrations of 3β-hydroxy-5-cholenoic acid, 3β-hydroxy-5-cholestenoic acid and 27-hydroxycholesterol, indicating oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase deficiency. The patient was homozygous for a mutation (c.1249C>T) in CYP7B1 that alters a highly conserved residue in oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase (p.R417C) - previously reported in a family with hereditary spastic paraplegia type 5. On treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), his condition was worsening, but on chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), 15 mg/kg/d, he improved rapidly. A biopsy (after 2 weeks on CDCA), showed a giant cell hepatitis, an evolving micronodular cirrhosis, and steatosis. The improvement in liver function on CDCA was associated with a drop in the plasma concentrations and urinary excretions of the 3β-hydroxy-Δ5 bile acids which are considered hepatotoxic. At age 5 years (on CDCA, 6 mg/kg/d), he was thriving with normal liver function. Neurological development was normal apart from a tendency to trip. Examination revealed pes cavus but no upper motor neuron signs. The findings in this case suggest that CDCA can reduce the activity of cholesterol 27-hydroxylase - the first step in the acidic pathway for bile acid synthesis.\n\nThis boy, the second child of consanguineous parents of Pakistani origin, had a birth weight and length between the 50th and 75th centiles. He presented to his local hospital at 5 weeks with mainly unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia and then, over the next 2 months the conjugated fraction rose. At 3–4 months his prothrombin time (PT) was prolonged, then, after a set of immunizations he decompensated with irritability, deranged clotting and low albumin, and was referred to the Children’s Liver Unit at Leeds Teaching Hospitals. On physical examination, he was still on the 75th centile for length but his weight had fallen to the 25th centile. He was alert and developing normally. He was mildly icteric with a normal size liver and spleen and normal muscle tone. An abdominal ultrasound scan (USS) was normal. He was found to be having episodes of hypoglycaemia and after an initial period of 2 weeks when his liver function tests and clotting times remained static they started to deteriorate further.\n\nLaboratory investigations showed no evidence of bacterial or viral infection and no endocrine abnormality. Metabolic testing showed no evidence of a disorder of amino acid or carbohydrate metabolism or of mitochondrial disease. His bilirubin was 130 μmol/L, ALT 60–70 U/L, and GGT normal at 15–20 U/l. His albumin was low at 28 g/L and prothrombin time prolonged at 26 seconds. Fat-soluble vitamin levels were all low. On day 2 of his admission in Leeds his blood sugar fell to 2.0 mM, with plasma cortisol 673 nM, and lactate 2.64 mM (mildly elevated). The acyl carnitine profile was normal.\n\nAnalysis of a urine sample by ESI-MS/MS showed that the major urinary bile acid was 3β-hydroxy-5-cholenoic acid, present principally as the taurine conjugate (m/z 480), and the sulphate (m/z 453). Analysis of non-sulphated plasma by GC-MS showed the presence of increased amounts of 27-hydroxycholesterol, 3β-hydroxy-5-cholestenoic acid and 3β-hydroxy-5-cholenoic acid.\n\nHe had been treated with ursodeoxycholic (UDCA) from 4 months (before his blood samples for bile acid analysis were taken), but he was slowly worsening, so at 4.5 months he was started on CDCA 15 mg/kg/d, and within two days he started to improve. By 6.5 months his weight was back up to the 50th centile.\n\nA liver biopsy was undertaken 2 weeks after starting CDCA when his clotting had returned to normal. This showed advanced fibrosis with an evolving micronodular cirrhotic pattern (Fig. 2). The lobules showed features of a giant cell hepatitis with lobular disarray and liver cell rosettes. There was also widespread micro and macrovesicular fatty change and paraseptal copper-associated protein.\n\nLiver function tests were essentially normal by 7 months when the UDCA was stopped, and remained so thereafter. Followed up to 5 years old, on CDCA (now 6 mg/kg/d), he had developed well. He had no jaundice and no stigmata of chronic liver disease. His weight and height were on the 50th centile and he had normal liver function tests. However, he was noticed to have a symptom that could be due to central nervous system dysfunction; he tripped a lot when he ran. Examination by a paediatric neurologist showed he had pes cavus but normal power, tone and reflexes in both arms and legs; there was no evidence of spastic paraparesis. His tendency to trip improved when he was given insoles. There had been no further motor problems when he was seen at 6.5 years.","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001939","obo:HP_0200084","obo:HP_0031964","obo:HP_0001943","obo:HP_0001761","obo:HP_0001397","obo:HP_0000737","obo:HP_0000952","obo:HP_0003073","obo:HP_0008151","obo:HP_0001413"],"previousTestingDescription":"Liver Biopsy.","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ee947953-7c22-46c3-91f0-e1255ecb95cc_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24658845","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1a8f4fe1-3b12-4a5c-9a01-81e1226add71"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"}}},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ee947953-7c22-46c3-91f0-e1255ecb95cc","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Downscored for consanguinity.","calculatedScore":3.0,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ee947953-7c22-46c3-91f0-e1255ecb95cc_variant_evidence_item"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":0.1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria","strengthScore":0.1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/66ebaf4b-9037-4ad9-af44-7a36d028fb2d_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/66ebaf4b-9037-4ad9-af44-7a36d028fb2d","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19187859","rdfs:label":"20-year-old man","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":20,"allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/00ee6a01-0284-413f-a43b-07a2396a0d63","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_004820.5(CYP7B1):c.169G>A (p.Gly57Arg)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA210941"}},"detectionMethod":"High-resolution melting (HRM) protocol assay of the coding region and flanking sequences of SPG5/CYP7B1.","phenotypeFreeText":"The proband was the third child of non-consanguineous parents.\n\nThe proband (F-IT.004/3) walked unsupported at 17 months of age.

The mother was a primigravida, and the pregnancy was uneventful. The parents were not consanguineous; both were healthy without evidence of liver disease. In particular, her mother had no pruritus, jaundice, or abnormal results for routine tests of liver function during her pregnancy.\n\nThe infant developed progressive jaundice by the age of 5 months. At 6 months, she was referred to Juntendo University Hospital with jaundice and hepatic dysfunction.\n\nAccording to a physical examination, her growth and development were within normal limits (height = 66.1 cm, weight = 7.8 kg). No dysmorphic features were present. Jaundice and hepatosplenomegaly were noted. No abnormal neurological signs were elicited. Her stool was yellowish. The initial results of the laboratory tests included the following: a serum aspartate aminotransferase level of 803 U/L (normal < 37 U/L), an alanine aminotransferase level of 345 U/L (normal < 43 U/L), an alkaline phosphatase level of 4334 U/L (normal = 110-348 U/L), a total bilirubin level of 13.1 mg/dL (normal < 1.2 mg/dL), a direct bilirubin level of 7.7 mg/dL (normal < 0.3 mg/dL), an albumin level of 3.1 g/dL (normal = 4.0-5.2 g/dL), a prothrombin time of 26.0 seconds (normal = 11.1-15.1 seconds), and a blood ammonia level of 95 μg/dL (normal < 70 μg/dL). The serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D level was <5 ng/mL (normal = 7-41 ng/mL). The levels of other vitamins, including vitamins A, E, and K, were not assayed. The serum γ-glutamyltransferase level was 36 U/L (normal < 75 U/L), the total cholesterol level was 171 mg/dL (normal = 150-219 mg/dL), and the serum total bile acid (TBA) level was 6.5 μmol/L (normal < 10 μmol/L). The results of a complete blood count were within normal limits. Specific liver diseases such as autoimmune hepatitis and chronic viral hepatitis and other metabolic defects were excluded by the appropriate investigations. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed a visible gallbladder and hepatosplenomegaly; no choledochal cysts, no dilation of bile ducts, and no ascites were demonstrated. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography showed polycystic changes in the kidneys (Fig. 1A). There was radiological evidence of rickets. Serial technetium-99m diisopropyl iminodiacetic acid cholescintigraphy showed that the tracer had entered the intestine. The patient's initial management included the administration of medium-chain triglycerides, ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA; 16 mg/kg/day), fat-soluble vitamins, and infusions of fresh frozen plasma. After 61 days of these treatments, her liver function tests had deteriorated further (aspartate aminotransferase level = 568 U/L, alanine aminotransferase level = 232 U/L, alkaline phosphatase level = 2205 U/L, total bilirubin level = 14.3 mg/dL, direct bilirubin level = 9.1 mg/dL, albumin level = 3.7 g/dL, prothrombin time = 20.9 seconds, γ-glutamyltransferase level = 24 U/L, and TBA level = 54.4 μmol/L). At the age of 8 months, the patient developed decompensated hepatocellular failure, and she was referred to the National Center for Child Health and Development for an LT assessment. The patient underwent liver biopsy and kidney biopsy. Living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) was performed; her mother was the donor.\n\nProgressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis types 1 and 2, which are characterized by low serum γ-glutamyltransferase levels, were excluded for our patient because her serum TBA levels were not elevated before her treatment with UDCA.","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0000113","obo:HP_0410042","obo:HP_0001987","obo:HP_0003573","obo:HP_0001413","obo:HP_0031956","obo:HP_0003155","obo:HP_0008151","obo:HP_0002748","obo:HP_0000952","obo:HP_0001410","obo:HP_0001433","obo:HP_0031964"],"sex":"Female","variant":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5fd4e32a-5ff7-4172-a3bd-c26f8cc82d59_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21567895","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1a8f4fe1-3b12-4a5c-9a01-81e1226add71"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"}},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5e0965c3-7883-49ae-bb57-a1383bbcade5_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21567895","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5118e765-e389-4069-9620-5a8d4306c1c0"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"}}]},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5e0965c3-7883-49ae-bb57-a1383bbcade5","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5e0965c3-7883-49ae-bb57-a1383bbcade5_variant_evidence_item"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5fd4e32a-5ff7-4172-a3bd-c26f8cc82d59","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Missense variant upscored because it recurred in probands.","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5fd4e32a-5ff7-4172-a3bd-c26f8cc82d59_variant_evidence_item"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":0.25}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria","strengthScore":1.75},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/64f27fe6-c324-46cf-8616-9be45743eead_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/64f27fe6-c324-46cf-8616-9be45743eead","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33849447","rdfs:label":"Chinese baby","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":5,"allele":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5118e765-e389-4069-9620-5a8d4306c1c0"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/57e7736f-c94f-4efc-bef9-5f10b49d76aa","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_004820.5(CYP7B1):c.187C>T (p.Arg63Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA4764275"}}],"detectionMethod":"Whole exome sequencing.","phenotypeFreeText":"The Chinese proband was the second born child to non-consanguineous parents.

The prothrombin time (PT) was prolonged and was only partly improved with parenteral vitamin K1 administration. Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) was 241,863 ng/mL. The results of renal function, electrolyte levels and whole blood cell count and smear were all within normal ranges. The serological IgM of HAV, anti-HCV and HBsAg were all negative. The ultrasound of the abdomen showed hepatosplenomegaly and severe ascites.\n\nShe was intravenously administered albumin (7.5 g) for hypoproteinemia, and given oral supplementation of fat-soluble vitamins. Treatment of the pneumonia was with antibiotics and methylprednisolone (2 mg/kg/day). After a urine sample was collected for bile acid analysis (after 3 day’s cessation of UDCA), oral chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA, 6 mg/kg/day) was administrated from the age of 5-months–10-days. Two weeks later, her coagulation function improved, bilirubin level decreased, and the pneumonia resolved. After discharge from hospital, methylprednisolone was gradually reduced and discontinued but she was maintained on oral CDCA. Her liver function markers, including prothrombin time nearly normalized after 8 months of CDCA therapy and she thrived well until the last follow-up at 23 months of age (Table 1). Further urine samples were collected at 4 months and 8.5 months after the onset of CDCA therapy for bile acid analysis.","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0000952","obo:HP_0012735","obo:HP_0001433","obo:HP_0003573","obo:HP_0031964","obo:HP_0008151","obo:HP_0001399","obo:HP_0030830","obo:HP_0030828","obo:HP_0001396","obo:HP_0002090","obo:HP_0031956","obo:HP_0001541","obo:HP_0001945"],"sex":"Female","variant":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1ecbe448-abf8-4af6-b4c6-8648a1e3e7c1_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33849447","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5118e765-e389-4069-9620-5a8d4306c1c0"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"}},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fb067581-6e4c-4d5f-b15f-290469b4e2f5_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33849447","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/57e7736f-c94f-4efc-bef9-5f10b49d76aa"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"}}]},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fb067581-6e4c-4d5f-b15f-290469b4e2f5","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fb067581-6e4c-4d5f-b15f-290469b4e2f5_variant_evidence_item"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1ecbe448-abf8-4af6-b4c6-8648a1e3e7c1","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1ecbe448-abf8-4af6-b4c6-8648a1e3e7c1_variant_evidence_item"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria","strengthScore":3.0},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5418d37d-1ffa-4899-b45e-286ed60ed9f1_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5418d37d-1ffa-4899-b45e-286ed60ed9f1","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19439420","rdfs:label":"FSP-563-010","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":60,"allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c520e337-66c7-4a04-8a36-b316f930d0c3","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_004820.5(CYP7B1):c.1456C>T (p.Arg486Cys)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA210948"}},"detectionMethod":"Direct sequencing.","phenotypeFreeText":"The proband is from a consanguineous family.

His jaundice was noticed about 1 week after birth. During the follow-up of his prolonged jaundice at a nearby hospital, he underwent ultrasonography of the abdomen, scintigraphy, and liver biopsy at about 1 month of age, which excluded biliary atresia.\n\nWe describe the case of a 3-month-old boy with progressive cholestatic hepatitis and severe hepatic fibrosis. After excluding other etiologies for his early liver failure, we found that he had profuse urinary excretion of 3β-monohydroxy-Δ5-bile acid derivatives by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis with dried urine spots on filter paper. He was confirmed to have a compound heterozygous mutation (p.Arg388Ter and p.Tyr469IlefsX5) of the CYP7B1 gene. After undergoing liver transplantation (LT) from his mother at 4 months of age, his deteriorated liver function completely normalized, and he had normal growth and development until the current follow-up at 33 months of age. We report the first Korean case of oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase deficiency in the youngest infant reported to undergo successful living donor LT to date.\n\nOn admission, he was active and had normal growth with a weight of 7.3 kg (85–90th percentile) and height of 62.3 cm (50–75th percentile). Physical examination showed yellowish skin color, icteric sclera, and hepatosplenomegaly. His development was appropriate for his age, with head control. His blood tests showed the following: white blood cell count, 10,200/mm3; hemoglobin level, 10.0 g/dL; and platelet count, 180,000/mm3. Liver function test results were as follows: aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase levels, 1,599/301 IU/L; γ-glutamyltransferase (GGT) level, 22 IU/L; alkaline phosphatase level, 1,423 IU/L; total bilirubin/direct bilirubin levels, 9.3/7.0 mg/dL; prothrombin time, 2.74 INR; activated partial thromboplastin time, 74.3 seconds; protein/albumin levels, 5.0/3.1 g/dL; and cholesterol level, 54 mg/dL. The serum bile acid level was increased to 131.4 µmol/L. The serum 25-OH vitamin D3 level was 6.7 ng/mL. Renal function and electrolyte levels were normal. Titers for toxoplasmosis, herpes, rubella, and cytomegalovirus were negative. Liver biopsy revealed giant cell change of the hepatocytes and moderate portal inflammation with periportal fibrosis (Fig. 1A). Immunohistochemical staining showed that the expression of bile salt export protein (BSEP) was focally decreased but not completely absent (Fig. 1B). Additionally, CD10 expression was not observed.\n\nAlthough the patient received standard supportive care for cholestatic diseases with fat-soluble vitamins and UDCA (15 mg/kg/day), his liver function deteriorated. As oral primary bile acids were unavailable in Korea, additional medication was not administered even after diagnosis. Eventually, he received living donor transplantation from his mother because of the rapid progression of liver failure.\n\nFollow-up urinary bile acid analysis showed markedly decreased unusual bile acid metabolites after LT (Table 1). His liver function has been maintained within the normal range. He had normal growth with a weight of 16.1 kg (90th percentile) and showed normal developmental milestones until the current follow-up at 33 months of age.","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001433","obo:HP_0032106","obo:HP_0000952","obo:HP_0031964","obo:HP_0031956","obo:HP_0001395","obo:HP_0001939","obo:HP_0001399","obo:HP_0003573","obo:HP_0002611"],"sex":"Male","variant":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/73000907-564b-4252-a518-69f5052bdb25_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30546280","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ad57d0c5-b223-4bf4-bbcb-0f793c245292"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"}},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/167afbbe-7c47-436e-8997-5fd4b05c162b_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30546280","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c442b62b-da02-4a6f-83b0-f2adaba0ea79"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"}}]},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/167afbbe-7c47-436e-8997-5fd4b05c162b","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/167afbbe-7c47-436e-8997-5fd4b05c162b_variant_evidence_item"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/73000907-564b-4252-a518-69f5052bdb25","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/73000907-564b-4252-a518-69f5052bdb25_variant_evidence_item"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria","strengthScore":3.0},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/57f1497c-4f32-4882-a269-2cc1abf466ab_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/57f1497c-4f32-4882-a269-2cc1abf466ab","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35387662","rdfs:label":"5-month-old Chinese male infant","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":5,"allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5118e765-e389-4069-9620-5a8d4306c1c0"},"detectionMethod":"Whole-exome sequencing.","phenotypeFreeText":"Ursodeoxycholic acid treatment significantly mitigated the condition of the patient and lowered biochemical indicators. Unfortunately, the patient developed septicemia and gave up treatment.\n\nThe patient (a Chinese male, 5 months old) was admitted to our department on 17 May 2020 due to skin yellowing for more than 4 months, worsened for 1 month, and fever for 1 day. The patient was the first pregnancy and first delivered child of the mother and was born at full term with birth weight of 2850 g. The parents were healthy, denied history of intermarriage and genetic metabolic diseases, and denied family history of hepatobiliary diseases. The patient developed skin yellowing 3 days after birth, and the yellowing was not alleviated after taking Chinese medicine intermittently (the specific medicine was unknown). Since the onset of skin yellowing, the patient was in good spirits but had poor appetite with yellow stool and urine. Physical examination showed body weight 6 kg, clear mind, good spirits without special facial appearance, developmental delay, unstable head up, moderate yellow staining of the skin and sclera, no abnormalities on heart and lung auscultation, soft abdomen, and redness and swelling around the umbilicus. The liver was 3 cm below the right rib ridge, with medium texture and clear boundary, and the spleen was unreached.\n\nAbdominal ultrasound showed that the intrahepatic bile duct was well revealed and the biliary tract was unobstructed. Umbilical color Doppler ultrasound showed abnormal echo in the umbilical area, suggesting umbilical sinus (Fig. 1A, B). Abdominal enhanced CT scan showed that liver was slightly enlarged and the density of parenchyma was diffusely reduced; the volume of both kidneys was increased, parenchymal density was not uniform, and multiple small sac-like unenhanced areas of different sizes were detected, mainly in the renal medulla, suggesting infant polycystic kidneys (Fig. 1C). Cranial MRI showed multiple punctate abnormal signals in the bilateral cerebellar hemispheres and near the posterior horn of the right ventricle, suggesting the possibility of multiple small hemorrhage lesions; the bilateral prefrontal space, the left cisterna, and the anterior temporal space were slightly widened, and the posterior horn of bilateral ventricles manifested small patchy abnormal signal foci, suggesting the possibility of myelination dysplasia (Fig. 1D).\n\nAfter admission, the patient was given symptomatic treatments, including anti-infection, liver protection, and choleretic treatment. The yellow staining of the skin was not significantly improved. The patient was given oral UDCA 50 mg three time a day from 21 May to 12 June 2020, 100 mg twice a day from 13 to 18 June, and 125 mg twice a day from 19 June to 1 August. After symptoms improved, the patient was discharged from hospital on 21 June 2020. The patient was regularly followed up for biochemical examinations and check-ups. The parents stopped the drug without doctor’s permission since 2 August, and resumed drug administration at 100 mg twice a day since 19 October 2020 when biochemical examination showed that liver function had deteriorated. On 21 January 2021, the patient was admitted to our department again due to unconsciousness. Unfortunately, septicemia occurred on 21 January 2021, and the family decided to give up treatment on 23 January 2021 and left the hospital.\n\nBlood biochemical examination results of the patient are summarized in Tables 1 and 2 and Fig. 3, revealing that the levels of most indicators increased shortly after UDCA administration, probably because liver function improvement takes much longer after the drug has its pharmacological effects. With the use of UDCA, the symptoms of the patient improved and all indicators demonstrated a declining trend until 2 August, when the patient stopped taking the medicine without consulting doctor. Thereafter, all indicators increased significantly and symptoms deteriorated until the patient resumed the drug again on 19 October 2020, since when some of the indicators declined again. The last two blood tests, performed on 8 and 23 January 2021, respectively, showed significant enzyme-bilirubin dissociation. Combined with the fact that the patient developed septicemia on 21 January 2021, this suggests that significant hepatocyte necrosis might have occurred since early January 2021 and might be part of the cause of the occurrence of septicemia. However, because the parents refused liver biopsy, the exact explanation for the test results and cause of septicemia is not available. No obvious abnormal products were detected in urine mass spectrometry analysis.\n\nThe patient in this case showed obvious cholestasis in the neonatal period, accompanied by skin itching, and umbilical area redness with frequent secretions. Ultrasound examination revealed umbilical sinus and infant polycystic kidney changes. Moreover, the child also demonstrated physical and nervous system developmental delays. Head MRI revealed multiple small hemorrhage lesions, slightly widened bilateral prefrontal space, left cisterna, and pretemporal space, and myelination dysplasia. Severe infections occurred during the course of the disease, which may be related to the deficiency of the body’s immune function due to liver dysfunction. The umbilical sinus of this patient has not been reported in other cases, and whole-exome sequencing did not detect other related pathogenic gene mutations.\n\nThis patient had polycystic kidneys, the first reported case of oxysterol 7-α-hydroxylase deficiency also had renal cyst changes, and certain types of congenital bile acid synthesis disorders have also been reported with renal cyst changes. The mechanism of renal cyst formation is not clear but may be related to the abnormal bile acid metabolites produced in bile acid metabolism disorders. The physical retardation of this child is considered to be caused by protein and lipid metabolism disorders and insufficient energy intake due to long-term liver function insufficiency and cholestasis. The developmental delay of the nervous system and MRI imaging changes of the patient may be related to the involvement of oxysterol 7α-dehydrogenase in extrahepatic tissues, such as the degradation of cholesterol in the brain and the metabolism of neurosteroids.","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0000952","obo:HP_0003573","obo:HP_0031964","obo:HP_0000989","obo:HP_0001939","obo:HP_0002240","obo:HP_0001263","obo:HP_0031956"],"sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/24aa844a-319a-424e-a9e0-7ece40b467d6_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35387662","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5118e765-e389-4069-9620-5a8d4306c1c0"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"}}},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/24aa844a-319a-424e-a9e0-7ece40b467d6","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":3.0,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/24aa844a-319a-424e-a9e0-7ece40b467d6_variant_evidence_item"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":3.0}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria","strengthScore":3.0},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2332f26d-64e8-480a-8667-d7044274f89e_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2332f26d-64e8-480a-8667-d7044274f89e","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30333426","rdfs:label":"66-year-old woman","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":66,"allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9f7f8076-b63e-4ffb-8798-f62fa5552699","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_004820.5(CYP7B1):c.741del (p.Lys247AsnfsTer8)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA2687454663"}},"detectionMethod":"Whole-exome sequencing and Sanger.","phenotypeFreeText":"A 66-year-old Japanese woman was the second of 5 siblings born to healthy, unrelated parents. However, it should be noted her parents were born in the same village. Her only child and all of her brothers and sisters were unaffected.\n\nThe patient complained of pain in the lower limbs at 10 years of age. At 20 years of age, she underwent arthroscopy surgery because of worsening pain in her knees and ankle joints. Nevertheless, there was no pain relief after surgery. After 40 years of age, she developed gait unsteadiness with slowly progressive aggravation. At 50 years of age, she was diagnosed with HSP because of the development of overt spasticity in the lower limbs. She used a walking stick from that time. From 60 years of age, she relied on a walking frame and was only able to walk for less than 100 m without resting.\n\nOn a neurological examination, she was intellectually normal, showed spastic paraparesis, and could not stand or walk unaided. She had stiff legs, reduced muscle strength, loss of deep and superﬁcial sense in the lower limbs, and positive Romberg's sign. Brisk tendon reﬂexes in the lower limbs and bilateral Babinski signs were detected. Metabolic and routine blood investigations were unremarkable. Serologic testing for the main autoimmune diseases was negative. Her low-density lipoprotein (LDL-Chol) level was 124 mg/dL, high-density lipoprotein (HDL-Chol) level 63 mg/dL, and triglyceride (TG) level 93 mg/dL, all of which were within the respective normal ranges. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed areas of white matter hyperintensity in the bilateral corona radiata and periventricular and subcortical regions on T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR). Mild cerebral cortical atrophy was also noted (Figure A). Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) revealed mild hypoperfusion in the left temporal lobe (Figure B).","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0002317","obo:HP_0003487","obo:HP_0012514","obo:HP_0002403","obo:HP_0002061","obo:HP_0002166","obo:HP_0002120","obo:HP_0030890"],"sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9dc3c907-bbfb-4dc9-838d-41e069201339_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30333426","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9f7f8076-b63e-4ffb-8798-f62fa5552699"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"}}},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9dc3c907-bbfb-4dc9-838d-41e069201339","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Downscored for recurrence of the variant and possible consanguinity.","calculatedScore":3.0,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9dc3c907-bbfb-4dc9-838d-41e069201339_variant_evidence_item"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cc6b6df7-9b3e-40dd-a1c7-1613ae5773e9_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cc6b6df7-9b3e-40dd-a1c7-1613ae5773e9","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21214876","rdfs:label":"II-1","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":52,"allele":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5677050b-2e3c-4d81-893f-43f91837e446","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_004820.5(CYP7B1):c.260G>T (p.Gly87Val)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA210985"}},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/68bebba4-d426-4915-b70a-adb37686d6c5","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_004820.5(CYP7B1):c.889A>G (p.Thr297Ala)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA210987"}}],"detectionMethod":"WES.","phenotypeFreeText":"Two Italian affected siblings with a clinically pure HSP phenotype (P4505 II-1 and II-2) were compound heterozygous for a novel mutation in exon 3, c.260G>T/p.G87V, and the known missense change c.889A>G/p.T297A in exon 4 (Fig. 1a) (8). They exhibited marked variation in disease severity: the younger sister (P4505 II-2) showed a severe phenotype, early age at onset, and long disease history, whereas the older one (P4505 II-1) manifested a very mild disease with just lower limb brisk reflexes and very mild spasticity. It is noteworthy that the MRI of the two sisters showed almost the same picture of diffuse WMA (Fig. S1, supporting information online, panels a, b).\n\nNoticeably, we found variability in clinical presentation and functional profile also in the affected individuals of family P4505 with a clinically pure phenotype. The qualitative similarities of the observed impairments contrast with the marked variation in severity. This observation, in the absence of clues for an identifiable epigenetic factor (the two sisters lived in the same environment and with very similar lifestyles), calls for the possible presence of genetic modulators. Nevertheless, the known CYP7B1 phenotype modulator p.R324H along with the other known HSP modifier polymorphisms in SPAST, p.S44L (17) and in HSP60, p.G563A (18) were all excluded.\n\nProband was noted to have slight diffuse hyperintensity of the cerebral deep white matter.","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0030890","obo:HP_0002061","obo:HP_0007340","obo:HP_0002395","obo:HP_0007210","obo:HP_0007350","obo:HP_0003487"],"sex":"Female","variant":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4c3dfc8a-80ca-4526-89b1-ed7ad56949c1_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21214876","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/68bebba4-d426-4915-b70a-adb37686d6c5"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"}},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bd54209e-f9f2-42a7-a781-e076abffc36e_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21214876","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5677050b-2e3c-4d81-893f-43f91837e446"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"}}]},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bd54209e-f9f2-42a7-a781-e076abffc36e","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Missense.","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bd54209e-f9f2-42a7-a781-e076abffc36e_variant_evidence_item"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":0.1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4c3dfc8a-80ca-4526-89b1-ed7ad56949c1","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Missense.","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4c3dfc8a-80ca-4526-89b1-ed7ad56949c1_variant_evidence_item"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":0.1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria","strengthScore":0.2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":10661,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria11","strengthScore":14.5,"subject":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/mqB5rUoVWxk","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_1060107","gene":"hgnc:2652","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.2","websiteLegacyID":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/assertion_e000ae1c-93a3-4f6b-bdf0-afd04603d407-","@context":{"@vocab":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"},"curationReasons":{"@type":"@vocab","@container":"@set"},"GCISnapshot":{"@type":"@id"},"dc:isVersionOf":{"@type":"@id"},"websiteLegacyID":{"@type":"@id"}}}
