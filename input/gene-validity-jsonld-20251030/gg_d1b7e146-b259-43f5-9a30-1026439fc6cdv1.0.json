Phenotypes onset at birth and can include severe global developmental delay, spastic tetraplegia, abnormal basal ganglia morphology, dystonia, decreased thalamic volume, absent speech, feeding difficulties in infancy, inability to walk, and hypoplasia of the olfactory bulb. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship include case-level data and experimental data. The genetic evidence in this curation includes two variants, one nonsense and one missense, from two probands, reported in one publication (De Mori et al., PMID: 31412107). The mechanism of disease is presumed to be reduced or loss of function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence. A *GSX2* knockout mouse model demonstrated a reduced lateral ganglionic eminence size in the forebrain at developmental stages E12.5 to E17.5, similar to basal ganglia agenesis observed in patients (PMID: 9398437).\n\nIn summary, there is limited evidence supporting the relationship between *GSX2* and autosomal recessive Diencephalic-Mesencephalic Junction Dysplasia Syndrome 2. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Cerebral Palsy Gene Curation Expert Panel on February 27, 2023 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d1b7e146-b259-43f5-9a30-1026439fc6cd","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2d6f7f67-63e7-4587-9216-6909f5883de9","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2d6f7f67-63e7-4587-9216-6909f5883de9_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10113","date":"2023-02-27T19:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2d6f7f67-63e7-4587-9216-6909f5883de9_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10113","date":"2023-05-23T15:09:13.570Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2d6f7f67-63e7-4587-9216-6909f5883de9_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2d6f7f67-63e7-4587-9216-6909f5883de9_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ca5ad9c3-5c5e-4fa1-9d62-8f3b5c3a95c9","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e729e966-8c6d-44a4-a6d0-552ffec8b325","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Reduced lateral ganglionic eminence size in the forebrains was observed in homozygous mutant mice at developmental stages E12.5 to E17.5, similar to basal ganglia agenesis observed in patients with GSX2 mutations.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9398437","rdfs:label":"Gsx2 KO mouse model","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2d6f7f67-63e7-4587-9216-6909f5883de9_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f6bf374d-71e4-49a2-b868-8e19c9cbdb3e_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/00dc9ccd-d3a4-43cc-b27b-726cdc575d8b","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1.0,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/00dc9ccd-d3a4-43cc-b27b-726cdc575d8b_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"Analysis of the fibroblasts from the proband showed reduced GSX2 mRNA level and protein expression that affected genes regulated by GSX2","functionalDataSupport":"Yes"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/00dc9ccd-d3a4-43cc-b27b-726cdc575d8b_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31412107","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/accacad1-4600-4764-9db1-cefcd8326d83","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_133267.3(GSX2):c.752A>G (p.Gln251Arg)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA356955836"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:AlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":1.0},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f6bf374d-71e4-49a2-b868-8e19c9cbdb3e","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31412107","rdfs:label":"Patient NG4687: De Mori 2019 (PMID: 31412107)","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":14,"allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/accacad1-4600-4764-9db1-cefcd8326d83"},"detectionMethod":"The proband and her parents underwent whole-exome sequencing using Agilent SureSelectXT V4 51mb Exome with 100-bp paired-end read sequences generated on Illumina HiSeq2500.
