Individuals with variants in *OTUD6B*  have been reported to present with intellectual disability, speech delay, seizures, microcephaly, gross motor delay, intrauterine growth restriction, feeding difficulties, facial dysmorphism, and various, nonspecific abnormalities of the fingers/toes.  This curation includes seven predicted null variants (nonsense, frameshift, splice) from 6 probands in 4 publications (PMIDs: 28343629, 34354232, 32181568, 30364145). Additional evidence (including individuals with putative loss of function and missense variants) has been reported in the literature (PMIDs: 30364145, 35707595, 35707595, 35430327, 32924626, 31147255), but these cases were not scored as the maximum for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss of function. Segregation of variants with disease in multiple families also supports this gene-disease relationship (PMIDs: 28343629, 34354232). This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence including an animal model and functional alteration studies using patient cells (PMID: 28343629). \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *OTUD6B* and autosomal recessive syndromic intellectual disability. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen ID Autism GCEP on the meeting date 08/22/2024 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/32a23c64-d5c8-43ff-8969-5f73167fbf40","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3c60103c-7d9b-4dca-aa03-151130c5d6db","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3c60103c-7d9b-4dca-aa03-151130c5d6db_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2024-08-22T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3c60103c-7d9b-4dca-aa03-151130c5d6db_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2024-09-30T20:51:43.830Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3c60103c-7d9b-4dca-aa03-151130c5d6db_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3c60103c-7d9b-4dca-aa03-151130c5d6db_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/896492ea-7c96-47ff-9018-c557548024ad","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Due to non-specific phenotypes of mice and lethality, we will choose to downgrade scoring.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1c88b618-d1fa-431c-b5fa-4a48829ba8dd","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Both mice models and humans were found to have restrictions in growth and congenital heart defects.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28343629","rdfs:label":"Mouse Model","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3c60103c-7d9b-4dca-aa03-151130c5d6db_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5268da78-f9a6-4a1b-8f02-06f7a7225de5","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2224a787-933d-4b92-982a-b810f3d821db","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Both of the 20S and 26S complexes from PBMCs of the homozygous subject exhibited weaker fluorescence intensity than those from the heterozygous subject, indicating that chymotrypsin-like activity was reduced.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28343629","rdfs:label":"Functional Alteration Patient Cells"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3c60103c-7d9b-4dca-aa03-151130c5d6db_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/597e9851-64b7-4909-8d05-1387651a7d8b_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c5548bb1-dfc0-4939-8630-060c631de969","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Homozygous variants also found in affected sibling within this manuscript.
