{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e1a833ec-0b49-400d-8baf-4cc38fbb5bdcv1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"*TP53BP2* was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant primary open angle glaucoma in 2018 (Michale, et al., PMID: 28150229). Primary open angle glaucoma is characterized by a loss of retinal ganglion cells, visual field defects, and cupping of the optic disc.\n\nThis curation includes one missense variant reported in one proband in one publication (PMID: 28150229). This proband was also reported to have a variant in the *MAPKAPK2* gene, and group members were therefore unable to conclusively confirm the cause of the phenotype within this proband. \n\nThis gene-disease association is not supported by any experimental evidence. The *TP53BP2* gene is expressed in the human cornea (PMID: 11709013), and its gene product reportedly interacts with components of apoptosis pathways and may regulate cell cycle progression (PMID: 8668206), but the relevance of this evidence to primary open-angle glaucoma is not yet clear.\n\nIn summary, the gene-disease relationship between *TP53BP2* and primary open angle glaucoma is classified as disputed. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Glaucoma and Neuro-Ophthalmology Gene Curation Expert Panel on May 18th, 2023.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e1a833ec-0b49-400d-8baf-4cc38fbb5bdc","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/05ac2b0b-5f6d-4227-ad08-0bb6c852583f","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"NoKnownDiseaseRelationship","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/05ac2b0b-5f6d-4227-ad08-0bb6c852583f_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10077","date":"2024-06-28T18:40:48.364Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/05ac2b0b-5f6d-4227-ad08-0bb6c852583f_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10077","date":"2023-05-18T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"The only proband used as evidence towards this curation was also reported to have a variant in the MAPKAPK2 gene, and we are therefore unable to confirm the cause of the phenotype within this proband. \n","curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/05ac2b0b-5f6d-4227-ad08-0bb6c852583f_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/05ac2b0b-5f6d-4227-ad08-0bb6c852583f_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/25380db6-a5fc-4832-836b-d57862c8f8e8","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"This proband has variants in both the TP53BP2 gene and also in the MAPKAPK2 gene.
