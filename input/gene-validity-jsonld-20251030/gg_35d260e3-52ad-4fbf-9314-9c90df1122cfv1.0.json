Sphingolipids have important roles in signal transduction and cell recognition. *SPTLC2* was first reported in relation to hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type 1C in a pedigree analysis of multiple families (HSAN1C; OMIM: 613640) in 2010 (Rotthier et al., PMID: 20920666), following a screening of the gene based on the previous association of *SPTLC1* with hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type 1A. Similarly, following reports of an association between *SPTLC1* and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Li et al. (PMID: 36966328) performed a rare variant association study to determine if *SPTLC2* was associated with ALS in 2023. Although the gene did not display a significant gene burden-based association with ALS, there were 16 individuals with ALS found to carry rare variants in *SPTLC2*. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found that the associations between the molecular mechanism and phenotypic variability of *SPTLC2*’s associations with HSAN1C and ALS, and the disease entities were split.\nNo case-control analyses or familial segregation evidence were scorable for the curation of *SPTLC2*. However, 24 variants, all of which being missense variants, reported in 11 probands from four publications (PMIDs: 36966328, 38041679, 38316966, 38041684) were scored in this curation. Importantly, 10 of the variants had functional evidence supporting their pathogenicity, nine of the variants were maternally and paternally confirmed to be *de novo*, and eight of the variants were carried by individuals with juvenile-onset ALS. Based on the curation, a genetic evidence score of 10.9 was reached. The gene-disease association is not supported by additional experimental evidence, resulting in an experimental evidence score of zero.\nAlthough the total score of 10.9 would typically result in *SPTLC2* being assigned a moderate classification, upon review of the evidence supporting the gene-disease classification, the ALS GCEP chose to upgrade the classification to strong. In particular, the experts believe that the repeated reports of confirmed *de novo* variants in individuals with juvenile onset of ALS needed to be taken into consideration. It is anticipated that with time more evidence will emerge regarding the molecular mechanism of pathogenic variants in the form of experimental evidence. Further, as the first association between *SPTLC2* and ALS is relatively recent, replication over the coming years may afford the classification to upgrade to definitive. This classification was approved by the ClinGen ALS GCEP on May 14, 2024 (SOP Version 10).\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/35d260e3-52ad-4fbf-9314-9c90df1122cf","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/402cf65d-02f1-4cc1-a45e-b3bd3ad48b86","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/402cf65d-02f1-4cc1-a45e-b3bd3ad48b86_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10096","date":"2024-06-26T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/402cf65d-02f1-4cc1-a45e-b3bd3ad48b86_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10096","date":"2024-06-26T20:43:49.948Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"Upon review of the evidence, the ClinGen ALS GCEP chose to upgrade the classification of SPTLC2 to strong.

Patient derived fibroblasts were also obtained from P2 and P5, which were used to measure de novo rates of sphingolipid and 1-deoxySL synthesis. They found increased production of canonical sphingolipids including long chain bases, ceramides and to a lesser extent sphingomyelins and glucosylceramides as compared with the control samples (Figure 4B,C), but not 1-deoxySL, consistent with results from SPTLC1 carriers. The fibroblasts also showed impaired response to inhibitory effects of exogenous ceramide, consistent with the variant's impaired inhibition by ORMDLs.","functionalDataSupport":"Yes"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3a71a021-8e7e-4a94-b852-4a186497fd83_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38041679","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8405d36f-3148-4f0a-9dfc-a7cc6026666c"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:DeNovoAlleleOrigin"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:Heterozygous"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6bf7f110-e0e6-4908-b388-20ef1c4f79b8","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Variant absent from GnomAD v2 non-neuro, GnomAD v3 non-neuro.
