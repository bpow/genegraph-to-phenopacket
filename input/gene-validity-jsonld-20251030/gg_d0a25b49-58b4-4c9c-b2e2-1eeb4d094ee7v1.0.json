Two variants (promoter, missense) that have been reported in 6 probands in 4 publications (PMIDs 16767100, 31445883, 39119839, 39425582) are included in this curation. Patients have a range of symptoms, including macrocephaly, hepatosplenomegaly, cytopenias, and portal vein thrombosis. The disease mechanism appears to be biallelic loss of function. Heterozygous carriers are reportedly unaffected. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by in vitro and in vivo assays showing a deficiency in glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) biosynthesis (PMIDs 11226175, 16767100). In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation GCEP on February 6th, 2025 (SOP Version 11).\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d0a25b49-58b4-4c9c-b2e2-1eeb4d094ee7","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b2f014f3-0570-46b6-b03e-89fac0387882","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b2f014f3-0570-46b6-b03e-89fac0387882_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10135","date":"2025-03-25T18:39:22.489Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b2f014f3-0570-46b6-b03e-89fac0387882_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10135","date":"2025-02-06T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b2f014f3-0570-46b6-b03e-89fac0387882_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/21aa145c-35cb-4b15-892f-1511e485dd29_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/335fd31a-60ca-415d-beac-ab31bff45a57","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1.0,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/335fd31a-60ca-415d-beac-ab31bff45a57_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"PIGM mRNA was reduced in affected LBCLs, to ~1% of wild type, while heterozygous cell lines showed an intermediate amount.

PIG-M has a functionally important DXD motif, a characteristic of many glycosyltransferases, within a domain facing the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), indicating that transfer of the first mannose to GPI occurs on the lumenal side of the ER membrane. A defect in PIGM affects GPI synthesis, which leads to reduction of GPI-anchored proteins being expressed on the surface of cells in affected individuals.\n","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11226175","rdfs:label":"Maeda Biochemical Function","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1.5}],"evidenceStrength":"Limited","sequence":10113,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria11","strengthScore":4.9,"subject":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/GD1ImDicwfg","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0012465","gene":"hgnc:18858","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","websiteLegacyID":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/assertion_b2f014f3-0570-46b6-b03e-89fac0387882-","@context":{"@vocab":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"},"curationReasons":{"@type":"@vocab","@container":"@set"},"GCISnapshot":{"@type":"@id"},"dc:isVersionOf":{"@type":"@id"},"websiteLegacyID":{"@type":"@id"}}}
