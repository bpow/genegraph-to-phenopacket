{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/777ac479-e73b-4cdd-8510-7ccb2ff20dc5v1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"The relationship between *DGUOK* and primary mitochondrial disease was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of February 22, 2024. *DGUOK* encodes mitochondrial deoxyguanosine kinase, an enzyme with a critical role in maintaining the nucleoside pool necessary for mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) maintenance by phosphorylating purine deoxyribonucleosides in the mitochondrial matrix. \n\n*DGUOK* was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive mitochondrial disease in 2001 (PMID: 11687800). While various names have been given to the constellation of features seen in those with *DGUOK*-related disease, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *DGUOK* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework.\n\nEvidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included 14 variants (six missense, six nonsense or frameshift variants resulting in premature truncation, two variants impacting splicing) in eight probands from six publications (PMIDs: 11687800, 18205204, 26874653, 29137425, 30956829, 35750291). However, there are more than 100 cases reported in the literature (PMIDs: 28215579, 20301766). Affected individuals have a spectrum of clinical features ranging from infantile or childhood onset noncirrhotic portal hypertension, isolated hepatic failure (with at least one case that was apparently spontaneously reversible), hepatic failure with neurologic involvement that is often fatal, and adult-onset mitochondrial myopathy with chronic progressive ophthalmoplegia and multiple mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) deletions in muscle.\n\nThe mechanism of disease is loss of function. This gene-disease association is also supported by its known biochemical function in maintenance of mitochondrial DNA quantity and integrity, as well as functional alteration in patient cells, and knockout animal models (PMIDs: 28215579, 17073823, 31127938). \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between *DGUOK* and primary mitochondrial disease. This relationship has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on February 22, 2024 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/777ac479-e73b-4cdd-8510-7ccb2ff20dc5","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/dd4c3ef2-6738-4770-ad64-4db31672ca9a","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/dd4c3ef2-6738-4770-ad64-4db31672ca9a_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2024-06-07T16:46:01.763Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/dd4c3ef2-6738-4770-ad64-4db31672ca9a_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2024-02-22T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/dd4c3ef2-6738-4770-ad64-4db31672ca9a_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9d20cd9f-67f2-4e9a-b02f-f244a68866cf_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1749695e-2480-4c95-95f2-ba2a897629b0","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1749695e-2480-4c95-95f2-ba2a897629b0_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29137425","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0c63aaac-6043-4752-bb5f-e71d0bb3a408","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_080916.3(DGUOK):c.313C>T (p.Arg105Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA254326"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d7c80bce-722e-4e71-9a48-b12dff9cf4b6","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d7c80bce-722e-4e71-9a48-b12dff9cf4b6_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29137425","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bccc3a47-2bf7-4cbd-8683-5bd6e5147ad7","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_080916.3(DGUOK):c.128T>C (p.Ile43Thr)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA347296790"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":0.1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9d20cd9f-67f2-4e9a-b02f-f244a68866cf","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29137425","rdfs:label":"Fang et al 2017, proband","ageType":"AgeAtDeath","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":10,"allele":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0c63aaac-6043-4752-bb5f-e71d0bb3a408"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bccc3a47-2bf7-4cbd-8683-5bd6e5147ad7"}],"detectionMethod":"Her father was a heterozygous carrier of allele c.128T>C (p.I43T). c.128T>C (p.I43T) -
