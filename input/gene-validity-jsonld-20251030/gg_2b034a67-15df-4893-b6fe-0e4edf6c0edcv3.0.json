There is abundant published evidence associating the *CDH1* gene with hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (DGC) since the gene-disease relationship was first proposed by Guilford et al. in 1998 (PMID: 9537325). Subsequently, evidence also reported an increase of risk of lobular breast cancer (LBC) in women. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in molecular mechanism and inheritance pattern of above phenotypes; therefore, this curation includes both DGC and LBC. In 2022, to encompass the increased risk of both DGC and LBC, the ClinGen Disease Naming Committee and CDH1-VCEP have proposed a new disease entity as CDH1-related diffuse gastric and lobular breast cancer syndrome. The mechanism of pathogenicity is known to be loss-of-function. 13 variants (missense, nonsense, canonical splice site, and frameshift) that have been reported in 7 publications (PMIDs: 9537325, 10072428, 10433926, 12588804, 15831593, 19168852, 24366306) were included in this curation. The GCEP also evaluated emerging evidence (PMID: 34949788) suggesting an association of autosomal dominant colorectal cancer; however, this evidence was not scored since the GCEP identified the evidence as still preliminary. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. This gene-disease association is also supported by experimental evidence (6 points; PMIDs: 8236461, 9515965, 14500541, 2009537, 2070412). Loss of E-cadherin expression coincides with the transition from well differentiated adenoma to invasive carcinoma in a transgenic mouse model. Additionally, re-establishing the functional cadherin complex by expressing E-Cadherin in invasive epithelial tumor cell lines results in a reversion from an invasive to a benign epithelial phenotype. In summary, CDH1 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant CDH1-related diffuse gastric and lobular breast cancer syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This gene curation was approved by the ClinGen Hereditary Cancer GCEP on 03/22/2024 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2b034a67-15df-4893-b6fe-0e4edf6c0edc","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/14223ff7-e6b0-4c60-bee6-df55301d2017","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":[{"id":"cg:sopChange"},{"id":"cg:summaryChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/14223ff7-e6b0-4c60-bee6-df55301d2017_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10023","date":"2024-04-12T00:53:42.304Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/14223ff7-e6b0-4c60-bee6-df55301d2017_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10023","date":"2024-03-22T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["RecurationNewEvidence","DiseaseNameUpdate","RecurationFrameworkChange"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/14223ff7-e6b0-4c60-bee6-df55301d2017_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1259669e-2544-46bd-8b9c-2dac35432210","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The deletion of the first 2 exons of CDH1 is predicted to have no CDH1 gene product.
