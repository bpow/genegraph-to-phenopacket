Folliculin interacting protein 1 (*FNIP1*) encodes the FNIP1 protein, a regulator of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein (AMPK) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) cellular pathways. FNIP1 controls B cell development through regulation of mitochondrial autophagy (reviewed in PMID: 39013219). FNIP1 deficiency is associated with a syndromic disease that includes B cell immunodeficiency and cardiomyopathy. The latter is related to the important role of FNIP1 in controlling skeletal muscle functional angiogenesis, which is required for muscle revascularization during ischemia (PMID: 37932296). Seven variants (missense, nonsense, frameshift, and splice site) have been reported in seven probands, and one additional family member, in four publications (PMIDs: 32181500, 32905580, 37522988, 39537849). This gene-disease association is supported by its function in nutrient/energy sensing (PMID: 17028174), which is altered in patient cells (PMID: 32905580). Additionally, mouse models recapitulate the block at the pre-B-cell stage and dysregulation of metabolic regulators (PMIDs: 22608497, 22709692) as well as some key features of the disease (PMID: 27303042). In summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between *FNIP1* and autosomal recessive *FNIP1*-associated syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.\n\nThis gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the Antibody Deficiencies GCEP on November, 16 2021. It was reevaluated on November 22, 2024. As a result of this reevaluation, the classification changed from Strong to Definitive due to the replication of this gene-disease relationship over time and two additional case reports (PMIDs: 37522988, 39537849).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f9b91998-0b80-4155-86d6-e0fc4097933e","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/25c930ed-965b-47ae-b9c2-7157b06cb868","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":[{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"},{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},{"id":"cg:sopChange"},{"id":"cg:classificationChange"},{"id":"cg:newEvidence"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/25c930ed-965b-47ae-b9c2-7157b06cb868_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10080","date":"2024-11-26T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/25c930ed-965b-47ae-b9c2-7157b06cb868_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10080","date":"2024-12-02T16:25:20.496Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["RecurationTiming","RecurationNewEvidence"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/25c930ed-965b-47ae-b9c2-7157b06cb868_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/52daefd7-1088-4245-a7a4-ec5c8b7a7701_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/52daefd7-1088-4245-a7a4-ec5c8b7a7701","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32905580","rdfs:label":"P1","ageType":"AgeAtDiagnosis","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":3,"allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/737a4604-4c91-43f3-ac6e-780771a51a12","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_133372.3(FNIP1):c.868C>T (p.Arg290Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA360800181"}},"detectionMethod":"Trio WES with Sanger confirmation.","firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"9.7 g/dl hemoglobin, 0.28x10^3 neutrophils/L, 0.13 g/l IgG, <0.01 g/l IgA, 0.08 g/l IgM","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001903","obo:HP_0032140","obo:HP_0030887","obo:HP_0032132","obo:HP_0033542","obo:HP_0004432","obo:HP_0002719","obo:HP_0001639","obo:HP_0001875","obo:HP_0030252","obo:HP_0001263","obo:HP_0002720","obo:HP_0002850"],"previousTestingDescription":"No candidates were identified within recognized PID-associated genes.","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ab6d1b76-4be5-4c8e-b35f-0534895b9c3e_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32905580","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/737a4604-4c91-43f3-ac6e-780771a51a12"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"}}},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ab6d1b76-4be5-4c8e-b35f-0534895b9c3e","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"homozygous by consanguinity","calculatedScore":3.0,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ab6d1b76-4be5-4c8e-b35f-0534895b9c3e_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ab6d1b76-4be5-4c8e-b35f-0534895b9c3e_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"Nonsense variant in exon 9 of 18 is predicted to result in NMD.
