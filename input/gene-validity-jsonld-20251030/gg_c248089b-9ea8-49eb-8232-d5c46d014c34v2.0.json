This variant is observed at a high allele frequency in gnomAD, 0.03761 (2561/251344) in South Asian exomes, bringing into question the pathogenicity of the variant. The mechanism of pathogenicity is reported to be LOF. In summary, *TMTC2* is classified as disputed in association with autosomal dominant nonsyndromic genetic hearing loss. It was reevaluated on 4/20/2022. This does not change the classification initially reached on 3/10/2017 when this gene-disease relationship was originally classified by the Hearing Loss GCEP.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c248089b-9ea8-49eb-8232-d5c46d014c34","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0e56b4d6-4947-4de5-a3a7-373145019239","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"NoKnownDiseaseRelationship","changes":[{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"},{"id":"cg:sopChange"},{"id":"cg:newEvidence"},{"id":"cg:summaryChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0e56b4d6-4947-4de5-a3a7-373145019239_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2022-04-26T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0e56b4d6-4947-4de5-a3a7-373145019239_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2022-06-24T18:21:29.379Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"One missense variant has been reported in one family segregating with AD hearing loss, however the variant is present in high frequency in population databases.","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0e56b4d6-4947-4de5-a3a7-373145019239_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0e56b4d6-4947-4de5-a3a7-373145019239_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0e56b4d6-4947-4de5-a3a7-373145019239_seg_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d3db5ef3-c534-497b-b4a4-b754f6b0c887_family_segregation","type":"FamilyCosegregation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27311106","rdfs:label":"Runge Family","family":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d3db5ef3-c534-497b-b4a4-b754f6b0c887","type":"Family","rdfs:label":"Runge Family","ethnicity":{"id":"cg:NotHispanicOrLatino"}},"meetsInclusionCriteria":false,"phenotype":[{"id":"obo:HP_0011476"},{"id":"obo:HP_0008596"},{"id":"obo:HP_0000408"}],"phenotypePositiveAllelePositive":13,"publishedLodScore":2.8},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ec5b841b-0126-40eb-bd38-3677c92533c8_family_segregation","type":"FamilyCosegregation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29671961","rdfs:label":"Family Dyad","estimatedLodScore":0.3,"family":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ec5b841b-0126-40eb-bd38-3677c92533c8","type":"Family","rdfs:label":"Family Dyad"},"meetsInclusionCriteria":false,"phenotype":{"id":"obo:HP_0000407"},"phenotypeFreeText":"Auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder (ASND)","phenotypePositiveAllelePositive":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValiditySegregationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0}],"evidenceStrength":"Disputed","sequence":4653,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria9","strengthScore":0,"subject":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/IgXiM8hCd9Y","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0019497","gene":"hgnc:25440","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"2.0","websiteLegacyID":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/assertion_0e56b4d6-4947-4de5-a3a7-373145019239-","@context":{"@vocab":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"},"curationReasons":{"@type":"@vocab","@container":"@set"},"GCISnapshot":{"@type":"@id"},"dc:isVersionOf":{"@type":"@id"},"websiteLegacyID":{"@type":"@id"}}}
