(PMID: 23812909). HS is characterized by the co-occurrence of holoprosencephaly, ectrodactyly, and cleft lip and palate. At least 17 unique missense variants have been reported in the literature. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, of 18 probands from 9 publications (PMIDs: 31512363, 27790375, 26931467, 27170295, 32373773, 30787447, 23812909, 27363716, 28825856). A mouse model was evaluated for this gene-disease relationship but was not counted towards the final score as it does not recapitulate the disease specific phenotypes (Calvert et al. 2011; PMID: 21479780). In summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more\nevidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory\nevidence has emerged. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Craniofacial Malformations Gene Curation Expert Panel on 2/18/2021.
