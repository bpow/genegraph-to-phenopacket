The disease was first described by Dorland et al., 1990 (PMID: 2387074) from two patients with neurological problems, however these symptoms could be attributed to infectious causes in both cases. The two original cases were not available for molecular analysis of PHYKPL. A third case was subsequently identified and two unique missense variants were reported in this single case (PMID: 23242558). This case was not reported to have neurological problems but did have an Ehler-Danlos phenotype, thought to be unrelated to her metabolic defect. From the limited information available at this time it is difficult to determine if phosphohydroxylysinuria is a neurometabolic disease or an isolated metabolic abnormality. In addition to the single case, evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes the experimental data establishing the role of PHYKPL in the breakdown of 5-phosphohydroxy-L-lysine (PMID: 22241472) and a knockout mouse model from the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium with limited relevant characterization. In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship.\n\nThis gene-disease pair was previously approved by the Aminoacidopathy GCEP on 09/25/2020. It was reevaluated on 10/25/2023. As a result of this reevaluation, the classification remained Limited with no new evidence identified.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fb8f85e5-acbb-44e3-b590-16d9f74df9a1","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/82ba1358-e58c-4187-bbe7-0f1bf41267d0","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","changes":[{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"},{"id":"cg:sopChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/82ba1358-e58c-4187-bbe7-0f1bf41267d0_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10011","date":"2023-11-17T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/82ba1358-e58c-4187-bbe7-0f1bf41267d0_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10011","date":"2023-12-08T17:44:06.552Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["RecurationTiming"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/82ba1358-e58c-4187-bbe7-0f1bf41267d0_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/82ba1358-e58c-4187-bbe7-0f1bf41267d0_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f4f6014f-a7d1-49e6-8ca5-d09e2db59bc7","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"PHYKPL catalyzed the pyridoxal-phosphate-dependent breakdown of 5-phosphohydroxy-L-lysine, converting it to ammonia, inorganic phosphate and 2-aminoadipate semialdehyde.
