At least seven unique TRPV4 missense and indel variants have been reported in probands diagnosed with SMD-K, including the common recurrent p.Arg594His variant. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation includes 7 variants in 15 probands reported in 6 publications (PMIDs: 19232556, 20577006, 21658220, 22419508, 22791502, 26377240). The mechanism of pathogenicity is suggested to be gain of function (PMIDs: 31463371). This gene-disease relationship is also supported by a mouse model with p.Arg594His and functional assays (PMIDs: 24644033, 19790068, 21964574, 18762026). Of note, variants in this gene have also been shown to cause metatropic dysplasia, spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia Maroteaux type, brachyolmia, and familial digital arthropathy with brachydactyly, which comprise a spectrum of phenotypes and will be curated separately. In some cases, there is overlap between skeletal and neuromuscular phenotypes caused by variants in TRPV4 (PMID: 31191204). Patients presenting with skeletal dysplasias may benefit from neurological, respiratory, and audiological evaluations. In summary, TRPV4 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant spondylometaphyseal dysplasia, Kozlowski type. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This curation was approved by the ClinGen Skeletal Disorders Gene Curation Expert Panel on 6/7/21 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/469200ff-958f-4f5a-b1d9-22ba6392700a","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d93031fa-8ea5-465a-a903-6e7ae36a5faa","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d93031fa-8ea5-465a-a903-6e7ae36a5faa_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10065","date":"2021-06-07T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d93031fa-8ea5-465a-a903-6e7ae36a5faa_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10065","date":"2021-06-11T15:14:16.838Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d93031fa-8ea5-465a-a903-6e7ae36a5faa_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d93031fa-8ea5-465a-a903-6e7ae36a5faa_ad_dn_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6bfb913c-75c6-4077-94b4-5be21e0be7eb_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Downgraded for consistency with SOP v8.
