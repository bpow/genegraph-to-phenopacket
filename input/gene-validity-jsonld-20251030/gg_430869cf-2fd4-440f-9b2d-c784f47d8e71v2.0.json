At least 12 unique missense variants, and 1 nonsense variant, have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 16 probands in 8 publications (PMIDs: 31671076, 21109227, 31828823, 29382405, 30208948, 33693846, 33742414, 38968056). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 49 additional family members. This gene-disease association is supported by its enhanced expression in skeletal muscle (PMID: 21109227), its role in relaxation of skeletal muscle where it interacts with actin (PMID: 31671076), and a knock-in mouse model which recapitulated human disease (PMID: 31671076).In summary, *KBTBD13* is definitively associated with  autosomal dominant nemaline myopathy 6. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.\n\nThis gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the CM GCEP on 06/22/2020. It was reevaluated on 01/21/2025. As a result of this reevaluation new genetic evidence (PMIDs:33693846, 33742414, 38968056) was identified and the classification increased from Moderate to Definitive.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/430869cf-2fd4-440f-9b2d-c784f47d8e71","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ff2f157e-741b-447d-a6c5-1d003e2e98e1","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":[{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"},{"id":"cg:sopChange"},{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},{"id":"cg:newEvidence"},{"id":"cg:classificationChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ff2f157e-741b-447d-a6c5-1d003e2e98e1_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10031","date":"2025-01-27T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ff2f157e-741b-447d-a6c5-1d003e2e98e1_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10031","date":"2025-01-27T14:50:41.672Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["RecurationNewEvidence","RecurationTiming"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ff2f157e-741b-447d-a6c5-1d003e2e98e1_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/425d9484-1a6a-4a93-bb65-c60f2abac419","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The Arg248Ser variant is located in conserved domains of Kelch repeats, and is predicted to disrupt the molecule's beta-propeller blades.

Fibers were exposed to incremental Ca2+ concentrations and the resulting forces were recorded; in NEM6 patients, maximal tension of both slow-twitch and fast-twitch fibers was significantly lower than in fibers of control subjects (tension reduced by approximately 50%) and relaxation was markedly slower. Similar results were found when the contractility of NEM6 myofibrils was measured. The low-angle x-ray diffraction studies suggest that the actin-based thin filament is more tightly wound in NEM6 muscle fibers, a change that might reflect increased thin-filament stiffness.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31671076","rdfs:label":"Muscle Contractility"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ff2f157e-741b-447d-a6c5-1d003e2e98e1_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b75cd16b-a5cc-4bd6-b88a-3d37821d6ba6","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The KI mice, using the Arg408Cys variant identified in the majority of NEM6 patients, closely phenocopy NEM6 pathology, including nemaline bodies in muscle fibers and slow kinetics of muscle relaxation.
