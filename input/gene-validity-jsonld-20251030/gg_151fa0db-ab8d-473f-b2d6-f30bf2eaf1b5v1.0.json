{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/151fa0db-ab8d-473f-b2d6-f30bf2eaf1b5v1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"The F9 gene has been associated with the X-linked Recessive condition, Hemophilia B, using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of 10/17/2018. This association was made using case-level data only. More than 300 pathogenic variants in this gene are reported in humans, ranging from whole gene deletions, partial deletions and duplications, nonsense, frameshift and splicing variants, with a majority being missense variants. Hemophilia B is characterized by a bleeding diathesis diagnosed by an increased bleeding time, reduced Factor IX activity and antigen levels. Mutations in F9 were first associated with this disease in humans as early as 1985 by Chen et al., who found a deletion of exon 5 and 6, with an expected amino acid deletion of residues 85 to 195 (PMID: 3001143). This paper was not scored, however, for this curation as the variant remained undefined.\n\nSummary of Case Level Data: 12 Points\nThe association is seen in at least 13 probands in 5 publications (PMID: 16643212, 25330515, 26612714, 3416069, 30210749). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 6 additional family members (PMID: 25330515). More case-level evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached.\n\nThe mechanism for disease is hemizygous loss of function in males, with the majority of variants observed resulting in undetectable FIX activity. Women are heterozygous carriers with approximately 50% FIX activity; however, X-inactivation may result in non-expression of F9 in some female individuals. About 1-5% of patients develop inhibitory antibodies. Unlike F8, no intronic inversions are reported in F9 (PMID: 3286010, 16643212). \n\nHemophilia B Leyden is a subtype of Hemophilia B that occurs due to point mutations in the promoter region of F9  (at -20, -6, -5, +6, +8, and + 13 positions). The phenotype is characterized by developmental expression of FIX post puberty, perhaps due to the influence of testosterone. At childhood, FIX levels are <1%, but levels increase with growth and, in adults, it could be up to 70% of the normal levels (PMID: 3416069).\n\nSummary of Experimental Data: 4.5 Points\nDog and mouse models are available for the study of Hemophilia B (PMID: 9639513, 9354664,19416882, 14722728, 10544912). Dog models have also been used extensively in Hemophilia gene therapy. Model studies have also contributed to the development of recombinant FIX for treatment of Hemophilia B. In a mouse model, the F9 gene disruption results in loss of function and absence of detectable FIX activity in mice with a phenotype of severe bleeding (PMID: 9639513). FIX deficiency is shown to be rescued by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated correction to yield detectable levels of FIX protein in mice (PMID: 26964564). Similar to Hemophilia A, gene therapy in humans for Hemophilia B using recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV)–mediated gene transfer is at the clinical trials stage.   \n\nIn summary, the F9-Hemophilia B gene-disease relationship is definitive.\nThis has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hemostasis/Thrombosis gene curation expert panel on May 22, 2019.

No such improvements were observed in heterozygous female carriers. Treatment of an 8-yr old boy, affected by HB Leyden, with testosterone derivatives improved his FIX levels. The mutation, -26G>C, termed Hemophilia B Brandenberg, however, is not associated with amelioration after puberty.\n\nIn this paper, the authors ruled out gross alteration by Southern blotting in the coding and intronic sequences before analyzing the F9 promoter. Of 3 sequence changes noted between Hemophilia B Leyden and normal F9 sequence data, 2 were dismissed as likely polymorphisms due to similarity with Factor IX Hoogeveen, and the T>A change at position -20 was expected to be unique to the Leyden phenotype. The authors speculate that this variant causes a switch from the constitutional expression of F9 to one that is testosterone dependent. This explains why the FIX activity improves after puberty.\n\nReijnen et al., (PMID: 1631121) reported that the wild-type promoter of F9 contains a binding site for hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF-4), a member of the steroid hormone receptor superfamily of transcription factors, and that HNF-4 transactivates the wild-type FIX promoter in cells of both hepatic and nonhepatic origin in transient transfection assays. The transactivation of the HB Leyden F9 by HNF-4 is greatly reduced due to this variant, -20T>A, and is completely abolished in the HB Brandenberg F9 with the -26G>C variant.\n\nThese promoter variants are well characterized with mouse models (PMID:19416882) and the evidence is awarded increased points.","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a7eadd61-0163-483c-b118-9fcadbb74c84","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3416069","rdfs:label":"Reitsma_IX-27","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":23,"detectionMethod":"Southern blotting with digestion byHindIII, EcoRI and XbaI and probe with factor IX cDNA was undertaken.

The authors report, through visual inspection of the in-silico three-dimensional atomic model of the full-length activated FIX protein, that the substitution of Arg at position 191 (145 in publication, legacy numbering) precludes the activation peptide cleavage by FIXa and FVIIIa tissue factor at this site, resulting in the activation peptide remaining associated with the light chain.  This variant has also been reported in 10 families from the Swedish Hemophilia B population (PMID: 26612714). This missense change has also been characterized in PMID: 6603618. HPLC analysis of peptides derived from the tryptic hydrolysis of Factor IX-Chapel Hill revealed the absence of a tripeptide suspected to be located near the Arg-Ala cleavage site. The authors claim that the substitution causes failure of the Arg-Ala peptide bond to be cleaved during coagulation. Rechromatography of the eluent with the variant peptide revealed 38 residues, containing the activation peptide, when compared to 35 in the normal peptide, confirming retention of the activation peptide in the light chain.
