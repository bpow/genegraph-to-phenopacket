Although there is no disease associated with SEMA4 in OMIM, there was an early assertion of association with Lynch syndrome (Schulz et al. PMID: 25307848). This curation will focus on this disorder. In 2014, Schulz and co-workers first proposed the association of germline SEMA4 variants in autosomal dominant Lynch syndrome by reporting a missense variant (splice site and missense) in a family with Lynch syndrome. This study also found that this variant is associated with colorectal cancer by a case-control analysis. However, in 2016, Kinnersley et al reported a well-powered study showing no statistical significance between this variant and colorectal cancer. The pedigree from the family with colorectal cancer also showed incomplete segregation. Hence Kinnersley et al concluded that there is an issue of type 1 error in Schulz et al. paper. Considering the lack of substantial association in genetic and experimental studies, the Hereditary Cancer GCEP has disputed this gene-disease association. More evidence is needed to either support or entirely refute the role SEMA4A plays in autosomal dominant Lynch syndrome. This gene-disease pair was originally evaluated as limited by the Colon Cancer GCEP on 11/13/2017. This re-curation was approved by the ClinGen Hereditary Cancer GCEP on 3/22/2024 (SOP Version 10).\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b7f89f2c-a8f1-4437-bf80-ef9ed676f86f","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/af6942d6-a886-4ef0-a979-bce7a971e111","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/af6942d6-a886-4ef0-a979-bce7a971e111_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10023","date":"2024-03-22T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/af6942d6-a886-4ef0-a979-bce7a971e111_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10023","date":"2024-04-12T00:45:17.171Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"Considering the lack of substantial association in genetic and experimental studies, the Hereditary Cancer GCEP has disputed this gene-disease association.

As compared with SEMA4Awt, SEMA4AV78M-transfected HCT-116 cells revealed significantly enhanced activation of the PI3K/Akt and MAPK/Erk pathways both mediating proliferation by increasing cells in S phase and accelerating G2/M transition (Fig. 4d,e; Supplementary Fig. 9)\"","functionalDataSupport":"Yes"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e8e36df3-b110-4a71-9bc4-aa5ed93eee23_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25307848","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/05ccc2dd-9fd8-401a-9a40-16f3f59165de","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_022367.4(SEMA4A):c.232G>A (p.Val78Met)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA1154952"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"No","zygosity":{"id":"cg:Heterozygous"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/af6942d6-a886-4ef0-a979-bce7a971e111_seg_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1005adf6-a311-47a0-a084-0be04c924cfe_proband_segregation","type":"FamilyCosegregation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25307848","rdfs:label":"K","estimatedLodScore":0.6,"family":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1005adf6-a311-47a0-a084-0be04c924cfe","type":"Family","rdfs:label":"K","ethnicity":{"id":"cg:NotHispanicOrLatino"},"member":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ef4c5bb0-ad2f-416a-81c8-f99cf34e26cd","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25307848","rdfs:label":"K18","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":62,"allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/05ccc2dd-9fd8-401a-9a40-16f3f59165de"},"detectionMethod":"\"We conducted genetic linkage analysis (LA) of five family members with colorectal neoplasms and one unaffected, putative mutation carrier (Fig. 1a), which revealed four shared regions on chromosomes 1, 3, 10 and 20 (Supplementary Fig. 2), none of them harbouring known cancer-associated genes. We next performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) on four of these individuals (Fig. 1a). A heterozygous germline variant was identified in the MUTYH gene (NM_001128425.1:c.650G>A:p.Arg217His, rs147754007) in the first-degree relatives K13 and K18 but not in individuals K3 and K14 (Supplementary Fig. 3). We, therefore, excluded MUTYH R217H as a culprit germline mutation responsible for the majority of neoplasms in this family, which is in line with the fact that MUTYH-associated polyposis is an autosomal recessive CRC predisposition syndrome12. To identify novel candidate causative mutations, we combined LA and WES and filtered heterozygous, non-synonymous protein-coding or splice-site variants with a minor allele frequency of ≤0.01 (Supplementary Table 1). All variants were confirmed by Sanger sequencing and analysed in two further family members with CRC (K16 and K26). Only variant p.Val78Met (NM_001193300:c.232G>A) in the SEMA4A gene located on chromosome 1q22 was shared by all tested individuals. However, in this approach, we included two individuals with colorectal adenomas constituting a frequent but not obligate part of HNPCC syndromes13. As this might constitute a potential bias, we focused in an independent analysis on variants from WES shared by individuals with CRC (K13, K18) or with an offspring with CRC (K3). Of 24 variants identified (Supplementary Table 2), two were also present in individuals K16 and K26. We excluded the p.Val212Phe variant in ZNF763 (rs7249379) due to non-conservation because Phe212 represents the common chimpanzee allele. Only SEMA4A V78M segregated with all CRC cases and was also detected in individuals K9 with testicular and K14 with breast cancer, respectively (Fig. 1a). Given a mean age of 61 years of individuals with FCCTX at disease onset5, we estimated a phenocopy rate of 0.00 and a penetrance rate of 0.56 of the SEMA4A V78M variant in Family K. cDNA from peripheral blood (PB) leukocytes demonstrated expression of the mutant allele (Supplementary Fig. 4).\"","ethnicity":{"id":"cg:NotHispanicOrLatino"},"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypes":"obo:HP_0006716","previousTesting":false,"secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e8e36df3-b110-4a71-9bc4-aa5ed93eee23_variant_evidence_item"}}},"meetsInclusionCriteria":false,"phenotypePositiveAllelePositive":5,"phenotypes":"obo:HP_0006716","proband":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ef4c5bb0-ad2f-416a-81c8-f99cf34e26cd"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValiditySegregationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/af6942d6-a886-4ef0-a979-bce7a971e111_cc_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8e8e338f-6623-48da-9a68-18200454666f","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"SNP rs76381440 is the SNP of interest\n\nThis association was refuted in PMID: 26961734\n\nThere was a response by original author defending the association (PMID:26960273) but insufficient to warrant scoring.\n","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8e8e338f-6623-48da-9a68-18200454666f_cc_evidence_item","type":"Finding","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25307848","rdfs:label":"SEMA4A Pro682Ser association study","caseCohort":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/054e92b5-de0c-4b4e-b946-7c2bd9081ad4","type":"Cohort","allGenotypedSequenced":47,"alleleFrequency":0.1276595744680851,"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8e8e338f-6623-48da-9a68-18200454666f_cc_evidence_item"}],"numWithVariant":6,"relatedCondition":{"id":"obo:MONDO_0005835"}},"controlCohort":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b71c59ee-c47a-4ed9-a196-0ae6507ca75a","type":"Cohort","allGenotypedSequenced":1138,"alleleFrequency":0.0210896309314587,"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8e8e338f-6623-48da-9a68-18200454666f_cc_evidence_item"}],"numWithVariant":24},"lowerConfidenceLimit":2.634,"method":{"id":"cg:SingleVariantAnalysis"},"pValue":0.00080,"statisticalSignificanceType":"","statisticalSignificanceValue":6.793,"statisticalSignificanceValueType":"Odds Ratio","upperConfidenceLimit":17.518}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCaseControlSingleVariantAnalysisCriteria","strengthScore":0}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallCaseControlEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/af6942d6-a886-4ef0-a979-bce7a971e111_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/af6942d6-a886-4ef0-a979-bce7a971e111_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/dfbb6b6a-b83e-47df-bfac-a5baed4ecb09","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Not a colon tissue-specific protein.
