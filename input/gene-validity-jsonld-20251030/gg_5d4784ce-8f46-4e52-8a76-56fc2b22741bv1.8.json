Most variants are *de novo*; one individual inherited a *CHD8* variant from a heterozygous mother who has some autistic features but has not been clinically diagnosed. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is loss of function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by a zebrafish model and a mouse model.\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *CHD8* and autosomal dominant complex neurodevelopmental disorder.
