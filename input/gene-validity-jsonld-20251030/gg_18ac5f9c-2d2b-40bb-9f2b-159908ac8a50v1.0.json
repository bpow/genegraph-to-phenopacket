Glutaminase deficiency is characterized by refractory seizures, respiratory failure, brain abnormalities and death in the neonatal period, though milder cases with spastic ataxia-dysarthria have also been reported. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Five unique variants (nonsense, frameshift, and missense) have been reported as well as a 5’ UTR repeat expansion (normally occurring in 8 or 16 repeats) ranging from 680 to 1500 repeats. Variants in this gene have been reported in six probands in 3 publications (PMIDs: 29468182, 30575854, 30970188), and segregated with disease in at least 2 additional family member. Experimentally, this gene-disease relationship is supported by its role in the production of glutamate, the main excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system, including the brain stem respiratory center (PMID: 12963351) and a mouse model with partial recapitulation of disease (PMID: 16641247). In summary GLS is definitively associated with autosomal recessive glutaminase deficiency.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/18ac5f9c-2d2b-40bb-9f2b-159908ac8a50","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1eedd351-1520-4354-9608-cf8d56ce9bd9","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1eedd351-1520-4354-9608-cf8d56ce9bd9_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10011","date":"2021-07-09T17:02:52.135Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1eedd351-1520-4354-9608-cf8d56ce9bd9_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10011","date":"2021-07-09T17:01:41.305Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1eedd351-1520-4354-9608-cf8d56ce9bd9_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1eedd351-1520-4354-9608-cf8d56ce9bd9_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/96e4d280-9ac5-4a3b-9916-b5ff3ae1510b","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Common features of patients such as hypotonia, seizures, and brain abnormalities were not reported in the mice.
