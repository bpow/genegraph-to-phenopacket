Since then it also has been reported to associated with AR foetal hypokinesia or congenital myopathy (PMIDs:26700687, 28003497, 30824560). Evidence supporting the gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data and experimental data. At least 18 variants including missense, splicing, nosnense and frameshift have been reported in at least 11 probands from 11 families in 6 publications and segregated with diseases in 14 additional family members (PMIDs:25707578, 26700687, 28003497, 30824560,30283817). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached.The mechanism for disease is homozygous or compound heterozygous loss of function. This gene-disease association is supported by expression studies, altered function and ​​biochemical function. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in molecular mechanism(s) AND inheritance pattern AND phenotypic variability.Therefore, all of the disease entities associated with autosomal recessive inheritance have been lumped into one disease entity, ​SCN4A-related myopathy. Of note, this gene has also been implicated in ​periodic paralysis, parmyotonia congenita, potassium-aggravated myotonia​​. These ​will be been​​ assessed separately. In summary, ​SCN4A​​ is definitively associated with ​autosomal recessive SCN4A-related myopathy.This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b4140852-aae5-40cd-849d-7754700601ce","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f71b22d2-1ee8-46f6-9488-a86588edd7d3","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":{"id":"cg:sopChange"},"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f71b22d2-1ee8-46f6-9488-a86588edd7d3_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10031","date":"2021-05-13T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f71b22d2-1ee8-46f6-9488-a86588edd7d3_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10031","date":"2021-07-23T14:13:07.928Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f71b22d2-1ee8-46f6-9488-a86588edd7d3_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/50741ba0-2266-44a5-bdf0-1448676d0769_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The D1069N has 3 het in gnomAD and 0.0012% (3/249166 alleles).
