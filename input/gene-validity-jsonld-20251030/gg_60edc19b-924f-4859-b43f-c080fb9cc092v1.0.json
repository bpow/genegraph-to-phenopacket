Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in molecular mechanisms, inheritance pattern and phenotypic variability. Therefore, the following disease entities have been lumped into one disease entity, Cardiac valvular dysplasia 1 and congenital heart disease. Nineteen unique variants (missense, nonsense, frameshift, splicing) that have been reported in twelve probands in three publications (PMIDs: 27799408, 33645542, 38171566) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached (PMIDs: 37770978, 36923242). This gene-disease relationship is also supported by a knockout mouse model, expression data in chick embryo, and functional alteration data (PMIDs: 27799408, 33645542). In summary, *PLD1* is definitively associated with autosomal recessive *PLD1*-related congenital heart disease. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Congenital Heart Disease GCEP on the meeting date December 2nd, 2024 (SOP Version 11).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/60edc19b-924f-4859-b43f-c080fb9cc092","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d37e1c81-cb59-45db-9481-338149fa5064","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d37e1c81-cb59-45db-9481-338149fa5064_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10130","date":"2025-07-01T15:09:26.265Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d37e1c81-cb59-45db-9481-338149fa5064_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10130","date":"2024-12-02T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d37e1c81-cb59-45db-9481-338149fa5064_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d37e1c81-cb59-45db-9481-338149fa5064_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8683c4b5-34e5-4b3e-a9c8-d98ecc5bfdbb","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/493b5e56-78c3-4eda-b4a2-936938376d3d","type":"Finding","dc:description":"The hearts of PLD1 knockout mice showed marked tricuspid regurgitation, right atrial enlargement, and impaired function of the tricuspid and pulmonic valves with increased flow velocity, narrowing and thickened leaflets of the pulmonic valve.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27799408","rdfs:label":"PLD1 knockout mouse","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d37e1c81-cb59-45db-9481-338149fa5064_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f977fed4-f757-4da2-9b50-6a6c9cf0689e","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c0537b7a-0c37-4fa4-a175-e47c74202a9d","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"PLD1 is required for endocardial cell endothelial-mesenchymal transition in atrioventricular cushion explants.
