At least 14 variants (missense, nonsense, frameshift) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes limited case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 19 probands in 10 publications (PMIDs: 25041077, 28664602, 31216263, 11719843, 17440689, 31595705, 31578821, 10545951, 28095440, 18331410).  However, many of the reported variants are considered by the EP to have a frequency too high for MODY.  Additionally, the observed truncation variants are not true null variants as they are in a region not expected to undergo nonsense-mediated decay.  For the rare variants reported, there is a lack of sufficient evidence to attribute causality.  Additionally, the p.His206ProfsTer38 variant is technically problematic and failed random forests filtering in gnomAD exomes.  A variant (p.Glu110Lys) in this gene segregated with disease in 12 additional family members in well-characterized MODY family (PMID 11719843). Summary of case-level and segregation data:  0.9 points.  This gene-disease relationship is supported by functional assays, expression studies, and animal models. BETA2 (encoded by NEUROD1) was shown to heterodimerize with the ubiquitous helix-loop-helix (HLH) protein E47 and then bind the INS gene promotor to regulate its transcription through yeast two-hybrid assays and transient transfection assays in HIT cells to measure transcriptional activity (PMID: 7774807). Mice homozygous for disruption of BETA2 developed hyperglycemia by 2 days of age with ketonuria, suggesting severe diabetes and insulin deficiency, with abnormal pancreatic islet morphology, reduction in insulin producing cells, and lack of mature (PMID: 9308961). NEUROD1 expression has been confirmed in pancreatic tissue (PMID: 24309898). Summary of experimental evidence:  3.0 points.  In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship.\n\nOf note, this gene has also been implicated in autosomal recessive monogenic diabetes (http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0015967), which has been assessed separately. \n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f7c27948-7935-4664-a50f-bf6d1d34801b","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8f4e7f54-becc-432e-9827-514c783e6bc1","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8f4e7f54-becc-432e-9827-514c783e6bc1_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10016","date":"2021-10-13T17:06:37.558Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8f4e7f54-becc-432e-9827-514c783e6bc1_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10016","date":"2021-10-13T17:06:57.983Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8f4e7f54-becc-432e-9827-514c783e6bc1_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8f4e7f54-becc-432e-9827-514c783e6bc1_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/745bcc05-aa53-4830-8cb2-269e528ce409","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Mice homozygous for disruption of BETA2 developed hyperglycemia by 2 days of age with ketonuria, suggesting severe diabetes and insulin deficiency.
