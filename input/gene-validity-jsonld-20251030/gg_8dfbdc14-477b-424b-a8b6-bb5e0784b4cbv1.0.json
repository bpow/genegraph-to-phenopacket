Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping & Splitting Working Group, we found diverse molecular mechanisms underlying these disease entities, ranging from biallelic loss-of-function to monoallelic gain-of-function, but no significant phenotypic variability as well as some overlap in inheritance pattern among the different groups of affected patients. Therefore, retinitis pigmentosa 4 (MIM# 613731) and autosomal dominant congenital stationary night blindness 1 (MIM# 610445) have been lumped into a single curation, under the broad disease term RHO-related retinopathy.\nThis curation includes 6 variants (5 missense and 1 nonsense) that have been reported in 5 probands in 6 publications (PMIDs: 1302614, 2137202, 26202387, 7846071, 38111930, 31239368, 34635090). More evidence is available in the literature, but was not required for inclusion. The mechanism of pathogenicity is reported to be mainly gain-of-function or dominant negative, with a few cases being loss-of-function.\n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by animal models, expression studies and in vitro functional assays (PMIDs: 38479725, 30976840, 17167410, 21126223, 30239781).\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between RHO and RHO-related retinopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time without the emergence of conflicting evidence. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Retina GCEP on January, 2nd, 2025 (SOP Version 11).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8dfbdc14-477b-424b-a8b6-bb5e0784b4cb","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/29542633-051c-4b06-af52-d2c5a2a8ee90","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/29542633-051c-4b06-af52-d2c5a2a8ee90_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10072","date":"2025-02-20T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/29542633-051c-4b06-af52-d2c5a2a8ee90_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10072","date":"2025-02-20T18:18:38.392Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["ErrorClarification"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/29542633-051c-4b06-af52-d2c5a2a8ee90_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cf738154-2f84-4d66-b291-e5f1d8408f16_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5c44ddc6-009a-4863-a95b-0fc4d8eff655","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"1.
