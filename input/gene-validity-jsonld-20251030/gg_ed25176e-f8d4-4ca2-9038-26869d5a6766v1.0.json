The EARS2 gene encodes mitochondrial glutamyl-tRNA synthetase 2, one of the mitochondrial aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, which function in mitochondrial translation by catalyzing the attachment of amino acids to their cognate tRNAs. Defects in tRNA charging can result in impaired synthesis of protein subunits of oxidative phosphorylation complexes I, III, IV, and V. \n\nThe EARS2 gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Leigh syndrome spectrum in 2012 (PMID: 22492562). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included twelve unique variants identified in eight cases from four publications (PMIDs: 22492562, 27206875, 27571996, 27117034). No segregation data were available. Loss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease association is also supported by biochemical function and functional alterations in patient cells (PMIDs: 29980628, 27977873, 22492562). \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support this gene-disease relationship, including that more than three years have elapsed from the first proposal of the association. This classification was approved by the NICHD U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on February 26, 2020 (SOP Version 7).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ed25176e-f8d4-4ca2-9038-26869d5a6766","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/774e378c-2636-41ad-be48-a2c00328ab9c","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/774e378c-2636-41ad-be48-a2c00328ab9c_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/774e378c-2636-41ad-be48-a2c00328ab9c_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2020-03-19T19:07:29.531Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/774e378c-2636-41ad-be48-a2c00328ab9c_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/774e378c-2636-41ad-be48-a2c00328ab9c_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/23d857f2-bcdf-48c1-8209-bd7676e42a96","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/98104671-be99-4826-ada1-2fb538f2f034","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Reduced respiratory rate and oxygen consumption reflect the increased production of lactate (increased blood and/or CSF is found in all affected patients)","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22492562","rdfs:label":"Steenweg patient cells"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/774e378c-2636-41ad-be48-a2c00328ab9c_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/15b4bba4-7df7-403b-9964-1d2b460f784c","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Mitochondrial GCEP criteria met","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e8ce1451-1e69-497a-ae8a-591457bef77b","type":"Finding","dc:description":"27977873: Rahman et al. 2017","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29980628","rdfs:label":"Boczonadi EARS2 biochemical function","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionA"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":3},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/774e378c-2636-41ad-be48-a2c00328ab9c_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/989deecf-0b48-4c92-a1ac-d216784e94e6_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/579def59-45f6-478c-ab7e-6a5fff84df6e","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22492562","rdfs:label":"Patient 2","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":10,"detectionMethod":"Candidate gene sequencing based on neuroimaging results","firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypeFreeText":"Leukoencephalopathy involving the thalamus and brainstem with high lactate (LTBL) - milder phenotype - presented at 5 months with feeding difficulties, mildly delayed motor development, and axial hypotonia; no unsupported walking, delayed language development; signs of deterioration including feeding problems, poor vision, irritability, and progressive spasticity.

Diffusion-weighted imageswere accompanied by restricted diffusion in some regions. Periventricular white matter was relatively preserved. The corpus callosum was normal. The N-acetyl aspartate/ creatine (NAA/Cr) ratio was low based on multivoxel proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) performed in centrum semiovale regions. Pathological lactate peaks were particularly present in white matter and also in other parenchymal areas, including the cortex.\n\nAffected brother has similar brain MRI findings with slightly different clinical course: had hypotonia and increased mobility of distal joints at birth and delayed motor development.","phenotypes":"obo:HP_0002352","previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/45543671-b6df-47da-ab65-69f4cf6cde2e_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27206875","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b069754e-cf69-4eb9-9e7a-df6b9e4ae39e","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NR_003501.1(EARS2):n.351C>T (undefined)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA395138693"}}}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":546,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria7","strengthScore":15,"subject":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/51csEQ057HM","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0009723","gene":"hgnc:29419","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","websiteLegacyID":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/assertion_774e378c-2636-41ad-be48-a2c00328ab9c-","@context":{"@vocab":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"},"curationReasons":{"@type":"@vocab","@container":"@set"},"GCISnapshot":{"@type":"@id"},"dc:isVersionOf":{"@type":"@id"},"websiteLegacyID":{"@type":"@id"}}}
