CAV2 gene is known to be co-localized with CAV1 gene and has not been associated with any disease independently.  Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found differences in inheritance pattern and phenotypic variability for these assertions. Therefore, these assertions have been split into the following disease entities: autosomal dominant Amyotrophic lateral Sclerosis (ALS), Pulmonary Hypertension (PPH3), Congenital Lipodystrophy (CGL3) and Familial Lipodystrophy – Type 7 (FPLD7). This curation for autosomal dominant ALS does not include probands from the other reported diseases. \nHeterozygous missense variants in enhancer regions of the CAV2 gene have been reported till date in individuals with ALS (PMIDs: 33264630).  In all instances of literature when available, affected probands with CAV1/CAV2 enhancer variants are identified to have dysregulated caveolar protein expression levels (PMIDs: 33264630, 36937187, 30894019). The maximum score for genetic evidence reached is 3.5 (Limited 0-6). Evidence supporting this gene disease pair also includes experimental data from patient lymphoblastoid cells and and IPSC derived neurons measuring expression of the calveolar protein (33264630, 36937187, 30894019).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0ff87a71-0627-4f0e-b657-766911efadb4","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/38faae4c-13ae-4c28-bea4-43e3ad15e178","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/38faae4c-13ae-4c28-bea4-43e3ad15e178_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10096","date":"2023-12-21T18:35:17.698Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/38faae4c-13ae-4c28-bea4-43e3ad15e178_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10096","date":"2023-12-21T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/38faae4c-13ae-4c28-bea4-43e3ad15e178_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/38faae4c-13ae-4c28-bea4-43e3ad15e178_cc_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8bfa1a87-976c-4581-8b08-d9c57b23a28d","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8bfa1a87-976c-4581-8b08-d9c57b23a28d_cc_evidence_item","type":"Finding","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33264630","rdfs:label":"Cooper-Knock- Enhancers to CAV1/CAV2 espression linked to ALS","caseCohort":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ad4a349d-5bef-4bf3-95f2-8f5021e9e647","type":"Cohort","allGenotypedSequenced":4495,"alleleFrequency":0.01245828698553949,"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8bfa1a87-976c-4581-8b08-d9c57b23a28d_cc_evidence_item"}],"numWithVariant":56,"relatedCondition":{"id":"obo:MONDO_0004976"}},"controlCohort":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9337ebe6-c2f2-4957-8ffd-e432d07f3369","type":"Cohort","allGenotypedSequenced":1925,"alleleFrequency":0.001038961038961039,"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8bfa1a87-976c-4581-8b08-d9c57b23a28d_cc_evidence_item"}],"numWithVariant":2},"method":{"id":"cg:AggregateVariantAnalysis"},"pValue":0.0000152,"statisticalSignificanceType":"","statisticalSignificanceValue":12,"statisticalSignificanceValueType":"Relative Risk"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCaseControlAggregateVariantAnalysisCriteria","strengthScore":3}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallCaseControlEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":3}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":3},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/38faae4c-13ae-4c28-bea4-43e3ad15e178_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/38faae4c-13ae-4c28-bea4-43e3ad15e178_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b853d86c-3c78-411b-aa71-6b643a5942ad","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The samples comprised of sporadic and familial ALS patients including C9orf72 and SOD1-associated ALS.
