To date, there has been one report of a variant in *NFE2* causing severe thrombocytopenia with mild effects on erythroid cells. Additionally, somatic variants in *NFE2* have been well described in myeloproliferative neoplasms and are not included in this curation. Evidence supporting this gene-disease curation includes case level data and experimental data.\n\nSummary of Case Level Data (2 points): One homozygous frameshift variant causing gene truncation has been reported in a single proband (Luk et al, 2020 PMID: 31951293).\n\nSummary of Experimental Evidence (3.5 points): The gene-disease relationship is supported by expression studies (Andrews et al, 1993 PMID: 8469283), cell culture model system (Lecine et al, 1998 PMID: 9716588) and a mouse model system (Shivdasani el al, 1995 PMID: 7774011).\n\nIn summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. \n\nThis gene-disease relationship was curated by the ClinGen Hemostasis and Thrombosis (H/T) Gene Curation Expert Panel using Gene Clinical Validity Standard Operating Procedures (SOP), Version 11. \n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f8a53afb-9575-46ad-8ed7-030aa1094593","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c0bfed63-0fd3-44a8-abc3-91207b5564e8","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c0bfed63-0fd3-44a8-abc3-91207b5564e8_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2025-06-16T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c0bfed63-0fd3-44a8-abc3-91207b5564e8_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2025-06-16T18:44:57.934Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c0bfed63-0fd3-44a8-abc3-91207b5564e8_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c0bfed63-0fd3-44a8-abc3-91207b5564e8_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a819e6d5-9ad1-4df2-9fda-ab4c630cd719","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a329993e-2ce0-41ee-94cd-a05fcaf8eae1","type":"Finding","dc:description":"The phenotype of the mouse and human are similar in respect to both megakaryocytes and erythrocytes.
