The specific disease entity, Anemia, hypochromic microcytic, with iron overload 1 (MONDO:0000104, OMIM:600523), is one of at least two known forms of microcytic hypochromic anemia and twenty known forms of microcytic anemia. Some of the most common patient phenotypes are: Hypochromic microcytic anemia, Increased circulating iron concentration, Anemia, Elevated transferrin saturation, Elevated hepatic iron concentration, Microcytic anemia, Increased circulating ferritin concentration, Pallor, Decreased circulating ferritin concentration, Decreased mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, Reticulocytosis, Hypochromia.\n\nTwelve variants: (Missense (9), Splice Site (2) & Multi_Frame Deletion (1)) that have been reported in 9 probands in 8 publications (PMIDs: 16439678, 16160008, 15459009, 35457224, 21871825, 19553145, 23016933 and 29178181) are included in this curation.\n\nMany of the probands were diagnosed during childhood after experiencing symptoms including Hypochromic microcytic anemia, Increased circulating iron concentration, Anemia, Elevated transferrin saturation, Elevated hepatic iron concentration and Microcytic anemia. Family history tended to be unremarkable. Siblings of the probands were generally found to be unaffected although there were instances of asymptomatic carrier siblings, a brother who had a haematological phenotype similar to one of the probands and a previous sibling to a proband that died intrauterine at week 39 presenting cardiomegaly and fetal ascites. \n\nOverall, the mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss of function as shown in the probands. \n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by multiple forms of experimental evidence such as Model System: Mouse (Mus musculus) (Quantity: 1), Model System: Rat (Rattus norvegicus domestica) (Quantity: 1), BioChem B (Quantity: 1), (PMIDs: 15849611, 24795636 and 9448300). First, a mouse model that has anemia and elevated hepatic iron concentration recapitulates the anemia and elevated hepatic iron concentration found in the human probands (Gunshin et al. 2015, PMID: 15849611). Then, Veuthey et al. 2014 captured a rat model with the phenotypes of microcytosis, anisocytosis and poikilocytosis that recapitulates the phenotypes found in the human probands (PMID: 24795636). Lastly, Fleming et al. 1998 (PMID: 9448300) describes an experiment where the expressing wild-type SLC11A2 gives HEK293T cells the ability to transport iron.\n\nIn conclusion, SLC11A2 is definitively associated with anemia, hypochromic microcytic, with iron overload 1-causing gene. This classification has been clearly demonstrated and confirmed through both experimental and genetic evidence and has been upheld over time. \n\nThis classification was approved by the General IEM GCEP on April 25th, 2025 (SOP Version 11).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b18fb176-dcc9-4b70-b1f6-7e8c7790a5d3","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/aff3ef34-58dc-4f1d-97fb-09100330865b","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/aff3ef34-58dc-4f1d-97fb-09100330865b_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10097","date":"2025-06-16T12:30:13.512Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/aff3ef34-58dc-4f1d-97fb-09100330865b_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10097","date":"2025-04-25T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/aff3ef34-58dc-4f1d-97fb-09100330865b_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/022e5c84-2958-4829-821e-a9c62c9849a9_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/022e5c84-2958-4829-821e-a9c62c9849a9","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23016933","rdfs:label":"55-year-old Caucasian woman","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":55,"allele":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6322d9d8-ca05-49af-a3b0-fb3228864574","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000617.3(SLC11A2):c.635G>T (p.Gly212Val)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA120097"}},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/57d5f9d3-f2fb-46a0-b036-c013000db6fc","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NC_000012.12:g.51028174T>A","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA2035861038"}}],"detectionMethod":"Based on her phenotype, several candidate genes were sequenced in the proband (TMPRSS6, EXO6, STEAP3, SLC40A1) with negative results.

Her young brother and sister also were healthy.\n\nThe pregnancy (38 weeks and 3 days) had been marked by the discovery at 25 weeks gestational age of a left ventricular hypertrophy. Fetal karyotype was normal. At birth, the proband was hypotrophic (weight, 2.150 kg; size, 45.5 cm).\n\nAnemia was discovered: RBC, 4.36 × 1012/L; Hb, 83 g/L; MCV, 64.4 fL; MCHC, 296 g/L; and reticulocytes, 270 × 109/L (6.2%). Activities of G6PD and PK were normal. Packed red cells were transfused at day 0, the only transfusion ever administered. At day 12, Hb was 113 g/L, and the baby was discharged with iron supplementation. Thereafter, growth and development were considered normal.\n\nThe family went abroad for 3 years, during which oral iron treatment was continued for 1 year. No strict medical follow-up was performed. The parents said that the child was pale, prone to tiredness, and avoided physical activity.\n\nIt was not until 2001 to 2002 that thorough investigations were initiated. A hypochromic, microcytic anemia was confirmed (Table 1). The bone marrow was rich, 30% of nucleated cells were erythroid precursors, the more mature cells keeping a basophilic cytoplasm. Acidophilic erythroblasts were rare. There were no sideroblasts and no extracellular iron deposits. Haptoglobin and bilirubin levels were normal, as well as Hb electrophoresis and analysis of red cell membrane proteins. Porphyrin assessment showed a discrete elevation of protoporphyrins in feces compatible with iron-deficient anemia.\n\nAfter several months of oral iron supplementation, a clinical survey performed in July 2002 showed a persistent microcytic anemia with normal serum iron, a high transferrin saturation, and surprisingly low serum and erythrocyte ferritin levels (Table 1). Continuous oral iron supplementation resulted in a rise of 10 to 20 g/L in Hb concentration with a striking improvement of quality of life. Discrepancy between high transferrin saturation and low ferritin levels led us to evaluate liver iron stores by magnetic resonance imagining (MRI).15 It showed a severe liver iron overload with 250 ± 50 μmoles iron/g liver (N < 36), leading to interruption of the iron treatment.

Inflammation was ruled out, as were hemolysis and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria.\n\nIn plasma, transferrin saturation and serum iron were high (79%, normal range: 20–50%; and 250 μg/dL, normal range: 50–170 μg/dL, respectively), and transferrin was normal (2.3 g/L, normal range: 2–3.6 g/L). Ferritin was mildly elevated (300 μg/L, normal range: 13–76 μg/L). Hemoglobin electrophoresis was normal. Bone marrow aspiration showed no ring sideroblasts, 4% type I sideroblasts, and hemosiderin-laden macrophages.\n\nWhen the patient was 17 years old, a radioactive iron study showed altered iron incorporation in red blood cells with a maximal incorporation rate of 29% at day 14 (normal range, 70–90%). Hematological parameters were unchanged, plasma soluble transferrin receptor was highly elevated (66 nmol/L, normal < 28 nmol/L), and erythropoietin was elevated (32.6 IU/L, normal range, 12–18 IU/L). Follow up since that time showed a stable disease.\n\nThe patient had undergone three rounds of deferoxamine treatment on the basis of moderately elevated ferritin levels (highest level: 574 μg/L): 2 months at age 17 years, 5 months at age 21, and 3 months at age 24. At age 27, she was referred to our reference center for iron overload evaluation. Complete blood cell counts were unchanged, and liver enzymes and C-reactive protein were normal. Plasma ferritin was 274 μg/L, serum iron was 37 μmol/L, transferrin was 1.8 g/L (normal range: 2–3.8), transferrin saturation was 83% (normal range: < 45%), and serum transferrin receptor was 2.93 mg/L (normal range: 0.83–1.76 mg/L), and plasma ceruloplasmin level was normal. Liver iron concentration, as evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), was increased: 300 μmol/g dry weight liver (N < 36). Non-transferrin-bound iron was elevated at 1.1 μmol/L (normal range: undetectable), and there was no detectable labile plasma iron (both iron species were determined as previously described).","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0003452","obo:HP_0003281","obo:HP_0012465","obo:HP_0012463","obo:HP_0033644","obo:HP_0004840","obo:HP_0001903"],"sex":"Female","variant":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7b0b9e0f-ce98-4df6-8cbe-2839e6fe785d_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21871825","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5a9bcd66-f102-40b6-8cbf-7254d494f44b"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"}},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9cb2775e-539a-4a1e-8829-e954a9433e3c_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21871825","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6322d9d8-ca05-49af-a3b0-fb3228864574"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"}}]},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9cb2775e-539a-4a1e-8829-e954a9433e3c","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Upscored due to recurrence and functional evidence.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9cb2775e-539a-4a1e-8829-e954a9433e3c_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9cb2775e-539a-4a1e-8829-e954a9433e3c_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"Functional Evidence: Figure 4 showing that although the p.Gly212Val variant correctly localizes to the cell surface (similar to the wild-type control in Figure 3), the p.Asn491Ser variant incorrectly localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum.","functionalDataSupport":"Yes"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":0.25},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7b0b9e0f-ce98-4df6-8cbe-2839e6fe785d","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Nonsense missense.","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7b0b9e0f-ce98-4df6-8cbe-2839e6fe785d_variant_evidence_item"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria","strengthScore":0.75},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e98d733c-cbaa-4f21-a577-d60448ddd768_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e98d733c-cbaa-4f21-a577-d60448ddd768","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19553145","rdfs:label":"7-year old boy","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":7,"allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d3265a58-2a91-4067-a72f-7ae8604e80e6","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000617.3(SLC11A2):c.223G>A (p.Gly75Arg)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA384849314"}},"detectionMethod":"PCR and Sequence Analysis.","phenotypeFreeText":"The proband, a 7-year old boy, had a microcytic anemia but no liver iron overload.

Body weight at birth was 2.530 kg. Family history was unremarkable. Both parents (father, I-1; mother, I-2) had normal iron parameters. I-2 had borderline low MCV values. Relevant clinical and laboratory data of the proband and parents are reported in Table 1.\n\nThe severe anemia was partially responsive to recombinant erythropoietin (rEpo) treatment.\n\nAt physical examination, the newborn was extremely pale, and the spleen and liver were mildly enlarged. Anemia was severe (hemoglobin [Hb] level, 40 g/L [g/dL]) and was accompanied by remarkable microcytosis (mean corpuscular volume [MCV], 71 fL) and hypochromia (mean corpuscular hemoglobin [MCH], 13 pg). The newborn underwent transfusions of 1 U red blood cells (RBCs) at birth and a second unit 2 days later (Table 1). At the age of 2 months the patient was referred to our department for persistent anemia. He was pale and had hepatosplenomegaly. Hematologic evaluation showed RBC count, 2.9 × 109/L (2.9 × 106/μL); Hb level, 74 g/L (7.4 g/dL); hematocrit [HCT], .25 (25%); MCV, 75 fL; MCH, 14 pg; reticulocyte count, 21 × 109/L (21 × 103 /μL); platelet count, 455 × 109/L (455 × 103/μL); white blood cell (WBC) count, 6.1 × 109/L (6.1 × 103/μL); and normal differential leukocyte count. Peripheral blood smear showed extreme anisocytosis and poikilocytosis.\n\nWhen the patient was 3 months of age, the degree of anemia was stable, transferrin saturation reached 100%, and serum ferritin level was remarkably elevated (864 μg/L [864 ng/mL]; Table 1). Other blood tests, including total and indirect bilirubin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), Coomb test, B12 and folate levels, Hb electrophoresis, and karyotype, were normal. Bone marrow aspirate showed remarkable erythroid hyperplasia. Free erythrocyte protoporphyrin (FEP) level was increased (4.7 μg/g Hb; normal value, less than 3 μg/g Hb). The α/non-α-globin chain synthetic ratio of peripheral blood reticulocytes was 0.85 (normal value, 1.0 ± 0.10).\n\nBecause of the presence of mild neutropenia (0.82 × 109 neutrophils/L [820/μL]) and slight increases in liver enzyme levels (GOP, GPT, and γ-GT), screening for viral infections was carried out that revealed positive anti-CMV IgM antibodies, positive CMV polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test results, positive pp65 Ag, and antineutrophil antibodies. A cycle of ganciclovir treatment was performed. Three months later results of tests, including PCR, to detect CMV infection were negative, but the anemia did not reverse.\n\nTwo more units of blood to reverse severe anemia were transfused when the patient was 2 and 3 months of age (Table 1). At this time, rEpo administration was started at the dose of 800 IU/kg subcutaneously twice a week, according to described protocols.10 The total weekly dosage was not adjusted for weight gain and resulted in a progressive tapering of the dosage. The treatment significantly ameliorated the degree of anemia and allowed transfusion independence (Table 1). A second bone marrow aspirate at 5 months of age showed hypercellular marrow and an increased proportion of immature erythroblasts with nonspecific dysplastic changes. A few erythroblasts had poorly hemoglobinized cytoplasm and rings of coarse basophilic granules. To exclude hereditary sideroblastic anemia, Perls staining was performed of the marrow smears but yielded no evidence of ringed sideroblasts.\n\nDuring the following years, the patient's Hb level was constantly maintained between 70 and 95 g/L (7 and 9.5 g/dL). Attempts to discontinue rEpo treatment, performed at 2 and 4 years of age, failed because the Hb level immediately dropped. When the patient was 5, his liver iron was measured noninvasively using superconductum quantum interference device (SQUID) biomagnetic susceptometry. This method quantifies the magnetic effect of the hemosiderin and ferritin iron complexes (paramagnetic properties) throughout a superconducting loop.11,12 The results are quantitatively equivalent to those obtained by chemical analysis of tissue biopsy.12 A remarkably increased liver iron concentration (LIC) (2536 ± 78 μg Fe/g hepatic wet weight) was observed that was equivalent to 14.2 mg/g liver dry weight and to a total body iron content of 150.5 mg/kg body weight.13 A 1.2-cm liver sample was obtained by needle biopsy. Six portal spaces were evaluable. Normal architecture with mild enlargement of portal spaces was observed, as were minimal focal inflammatory infiltrates. At Perl staining, severe iron overload was detected (grade 3 according to Sciot14 ), involving hepatocytes and Kupffer cells. The iron distribution was predominantly on zone 1 (Figure 1).","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0003281","obo:HP_0005518","obo:HP_0004325","obo:HP_0004447","obo:HP_0004840","obo:HP_0003452","obo:HP_0001433","obo:HP_0001900","obo:HP_0011273","obo:HP_0001903","obo:HP_0032231","obo:HP_0025547","obo:HP_0025066","obo:HP_0012465","obo:HP_0000980"],"sex":"Male","variant":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fd19d8ac-bbff-408b-8d6c-3f56943ba6ba_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16160008","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/52402d30-13e4-437e-898f-bb2f9b3474f4"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"}},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/345e4842-56ec-4c21-9f35-5b09614d54d6_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16160008","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f5470354-c5b0-4164-988b-4794ad3e59cc"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"}}]},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/345e4842-56ec-4c21-9f35-5b09614d54d6","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/345e4842-56ec-4c21-9f35-5b09614d54d6_variant_evidence_item"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fd19d8ac-bbff-408b-8d6c-3f56943ba6ba","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Upscored for functional evidence.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fd19d8ac-bbff-408b-8d6c-3f56943ba6ba_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fd19d8ac-bbff-408b-8d6c-3f56943ba6ba_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"Functional Evidence:\nPMID: 16584902 that shows in Figure 2C that the variant dramatically decreases the ability of SLC11A2 to localize to the cell surface.","functionalDataSupport":"Yes"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":0.25}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria","strengthScore":1.75}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":8.55},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/aff3ef34-58dc-4f1d-97fb-09100330865b_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/aff3ef34-58dc-4f1d-97fb-09100330865b_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7395ff63-23ef-4657-ae37-5c8dc73cde5c","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Upscored due to strength of evidence.
