The predicted effect of *IFNAR1* deficiency is to prevent signaling and downstream functional responses to type I interferons but leave intact responses to type II and III. *IFNAR1* deficiency predisposes to disease following live attenuated viral vaccine, but also to Herpes Simplex Encephalitis and severe COVID-19. Genetic evidence was included in this curation from 8 probands in 6 publications (PMIDs: 31270247, 32960813, 33252644, 32972995, 35091979, 35442418). The proposed mechanism of disease is loss of function and the nine reported variants include missense, splice site, nonsense, and full exon deletions. There is no in vivo evidence of susceptibility to viral infections in healthy carriers. Experimentally, this gene-disease relationship is supported by its function as a receptor of type I interferons (PMID: 2153461). Functional alteration in patient cells resulted in major defects in type I IFN signaling (PMIDs: 31270247, 32960813, 33252644, 32972995) and inability to surpress viral replication, which could be rescued with WT *IFNAR1* (PMIDs: 31270247, 33252644, 32972995). Additionally, a null mouse model recapitulates diesase with increased susceptibility to viral infection (PMID: 7479980). In summary, there is Definitive evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both research and the clinical diagnostic setting and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d6b0eeff-4d2c-4fec-abce-9e1da726829c","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/04c73236-ed2c-4794-a157-4560d7cc3367","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/04c73236-ed2c-4794-a157-4560d7cc3367_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10081","date":"2025-05-15T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/04c73236-ed2c-4794-a157-4560d7cc3367_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10081","date":"2025-05-15T16:19:40.121Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/04c73236-ed2c-4794-a157-4560d7cc3367_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6cd41d4a-7505-4348-9113-7e8d8eb0756d_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d5d3ddc3-e6d4-4a87-b647-866ba2922181","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"gnomAD Grpmax FAF 0.000005550\n\nThis nonsense variant is homozygous by consanguinity.

When pretreated with IFN-α2b, healthy control cells were able to control VSV replication 24 h after infection. In contrast, viral replication could not be suppressed in patient cells treated with IFN-α2b. Similar results were observed with YFV-17D, a vaccine strain highly similar to that responsible for P2’s infection. To assess if the patients’ cellular phenotypes were caused by the lack of normal IFNAR1, the authors transduced patients’ primary fibroblasts with WT IFNAR1, IFNAR2, or an empty vector. Only transduction with IFNAR1 was able to rescue the defect in IFNAR1 expression levels and patients’ responses to type I IFN as assessed by induction of MX1 and IFIT1 following IFN-α2b or -β stimulation.
