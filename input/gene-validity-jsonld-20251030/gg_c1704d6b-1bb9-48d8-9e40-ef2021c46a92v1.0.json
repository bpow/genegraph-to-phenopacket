The C12orf65 gene encodes an important mitochondrial translation release factor that functions in releasing newly synthesized peptides from the mitochondrial ribosome.\n\nThe C12orf65 gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Leigh syndrome spectrum in 2010 (PMID: 20598281). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included four unique variants identified in six cases from five publications (PMIDs: 20598281, 24284555, 27858754, 25995486, 26380172). No segregation data were available. Loss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease association is also supported by known biochemical function, expression, functional alteration in patient cells, functional alteration in non-patient cells, and rescue in patient cells (PMIDs: 27977873, 18853439, 20598281, 22821833, 27858754, 26380172). \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support this gene-disease relationship, including that more than three years have elapsed from the first proposal of the association. This classification was approved by NICHD U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on December 9, 2019 (SOP Version 7).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c1704d6b-1bb9-48d8-9e40-ef2021c46a92","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/78f97463-d8b2-411a-9292-1908646dac77","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/78f97463-d8b2-411a-9292-1908646dac77_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2021-04-01T17:45:17.105Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/78f97463-d8b2-411a-9292-1908646dac77_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2021-04-01T17:45:00.572Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/78f97463-d8b2-411a-9292-1908646dac77_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/78f97463-d8b2-411a-9292-1908646dac77_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a43e8cf5-f172-44a6-a5a4-337f37ce228b","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Per Mito GCEP scoring guidance","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/de2bac74-7dd2-4562-a45d-e1d7a16c8b64","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Expression of the wild-type C12orf65 cDNA rescued the mitochondrial protein synthesis defect in both patients (Figure 1B), which resulted in near control levels of all OXPHOS complexes in patient fibroblasts (Figure 1A).

However, these failed to proliferate on galactose (Fig. 2E, F), a substrate that forces cells to utilise oxidative phosphorylation rather than glycolysis for ATP production. This observation confirmed that the cells express a mitochondrial respiratory chain defect, consistent with the decrease in complex IV activity determined spectrophotometrically. \n\nDe novo mitochondrial translation was assessed in patient fibroblasts and indicated a global decrease in protein synthesis (Fig. 4A), as seen in previously reported patients. This reduction in mt-protein synthesis is not a consequence of a reduction in mt-RNA levels, which are modestly elevated (Fig. 4B), again as seen in other C12orf65 patients. When cells are artificially depleted of C12orf65 protein using siRNA, the elevation in mt-RNA levels is more striking (Fig. 4C). A mitoribosome defect is unlikely to be responsible in\nthis patient, as no global differences were observed in the steady state levels of mitoribosomal protein levels (Fig. 4D). To identify if the synthesised polypeptides are stable, steady state levels of RC proteins were assessed by western blotting following SDS-PAGE. This confirmed decreased levels of complex IV (COX2 expression), consistent with our biochemical assays but also revealed reduced levels of CI and modest changes in CIII subunits (Fig. 4E). To determine if synthesised polypeptides were incorporated into fully assembled oxidative phosphorylation complexes, western blots of mitochondrial fractions separated by 1D BN-PAGE were performed. A reduction in the amount of fully assembled complexes I, IV and V was observed in the patient compared to controls, together with a minor complex III defect, visible in the I+III supercomplex (Fig. 4F). These data are consistent with C12orf65 playing a ubiquitous role in mt-translation but with a more severe effect on CIV activity. This translation defect caused by loss of C12orf65 does not appear to trigger an unfolded protein response as no increase was seen in relevant proteases (Fig. 4G, LONP and CLPX).","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27858754","rdfs:label":"Wesolowska et al_functional alteration in patient cells"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8397f1f2-8aa4-43f2-a6d4-aa4ee3612ff8","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Gene knockdown induces mitochondrial dysfunction in non-patient cells.","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a3c1f08e-afaa-42e5-ac93-0c6c47bf261e","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Knockdown of the C12orf65 protein in cell culture assays resulted in an increase in reactive oxygen species and apoptosis.

At 2 yr: decreased visual acuity; diffuse optic atrophy; normal brain MRI and spectroscopy. At 7 yr: drop in vision of left eye; abduction limitation of the right eye; decreased movement of left side of face; reduced strength in lower extremities; brisk deep tendon reflexes; upgoing toes; lumbering gait with modified Gowers maneuver; bilateral intention tremor and dysmetria. MRI revealed areas of T2 prolongation involving the bilateral periaqueductal gray matter, extending inferiorly along the pontine tegmentum and facial colliculi, terminating in the dorsal aspect of the central medulla (Fig. 1). These areas were not associated with brainstem expansion or volume loss. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) demonstrated mixed diffusion characteristics with areas of low and high diffusivity. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy showed nonspecific mildly elevated choline–N-acetylaspartate ratio within the region of signal abnormality of the right midbrain. This constellation of findings was suggestive of Leigh syndrome. Repeat brain MRI at 8 years of age showed a decrease in the extent of the T2 prolongation previously identified within the midline medulla, ventral pons, and periaqueductal regions, with extension into the midbrain around the red nucleus. The optic nerve sheaths remained dilated bilaterally (Fig. 2). Plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) lactate levels were normal, as was pyruvic acid in whole blood and plasma creatine kinase levels. Lumbar puncture revealed decreased glucose of 56 mg/dL (normal: 60–80 mg/dL) and low protein of 13.8 mg/dL (normal: 15.0–45.0 mg/dL), with normal CSF amino acids, neurotransmitters, sialic acid, and 5-methyltetrahydrofolate. Activity of complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase) in fibroblasts was reduced to below 40% of normal controls in Case 1 and below 30% in younger sibling. Abnormal mitochondria in fibroblasts on EM.
