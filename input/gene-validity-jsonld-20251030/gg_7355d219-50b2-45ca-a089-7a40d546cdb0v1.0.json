The *GMNN* gene was first reported in relation to AD Meier-Gorlin Syndrome 6 (MGS6) in 2015 (Burrage et al. 2015, PMID:26637980). Meier-Gorlin syndrome is characterized by a clinical triad of symptoms: short stature, microtia, and small or absent patellae. In addition to the MGS triad, some individuals with MGS6 have marked lumbar lordosis, failure to thrive and developmental delay and/or cognitive impairment. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Three unique de novo variants reported in three individuals with Meier-Gorlin syndrome 6 from one publication (PMID:26637980) are included in this curation. These variants include one missense, one frameshift, and one nonsense, all in the first coding exon and predicted to result in a stable truncated protein starting at Met28. The mechanism of disease is unknown but suggestive of heterozygous gain-of-function/dominant negative. Supporting experimental evidence includes protein interaction data and a cell culture model. Several genes involved in DNA replication initiation have been associated with Meier-Gorlin syndrome. The GMNN protein is an inhibitor of the DNA replication initiation complex through direct CDT1 binding. The gene-disease relationship for CDT1 with Meier-Gorlin syndrome 4  has been curated and classified as definitive for (Caillat et al. 2012, PMID:22918581). Studies on an HCT116 cell culture model expressing an N-terminus truncated GMNN protein with an interrupted destruction box sequence (met-28 start) showed increased protein stability,reduced chromatin loading of MCM complex proteins, inhibited DNA replication, and impaired cell growth (Yoshida et al. 2004, PMID:14712211). In summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Syndromic Disorders GCEP on the meeting date Dec 4th, 2024 (SOP Version 11).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7355d219-50b2-45ca-a089-7a40d546cdb0","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9d7274f8-8ae0-4260-bea2-c2c590967785","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9d7274f8-8ae0-4260-bea2-c2c590967785_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10060","date":"2024-12-04T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9d7274f8-8ae0-4260-bea2-c2c590967785_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10060","date":"2025-01-07T15:31:49.300Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9d7274f8-8ae0-4260-bea2-c2c590967785_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f4f664b9-cc96-44a3-a366-8a82dc31f274","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Upgraded for expression of a stable truncated protein and specificity of the phenotype.","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f4f664b9-cc96-44a3-a366-8a82dc31f274_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"Variant leads to the expression of a stable truncated protein ","functionalDataSupport":"No"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f4f664b9-cc96-44a3-a366-8a82dc31f274_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26637980","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6799643a-f1a6-4899-81cb-4f142b4a8e9c","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_015895.5(GMNN):c.16A>T (p.Lys6Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA250418"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:DeNovoAlleleOrigin"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:Heterozygous"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/17fc8b96-086d-4d65-a5ae-8f31e9589602","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"spliceAI = 0.31 predicting skipping of first coding exon is consistent with this variant leading to a stable truncated protein.
