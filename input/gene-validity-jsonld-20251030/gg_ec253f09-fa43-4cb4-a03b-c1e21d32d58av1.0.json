At least 8 unique variant (missense, nonsense, frameshift, etc.) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level, segregation and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 9 probands in 7 publications (PMIDs: 10935639, 11389161,   21120445, 26316437, 25771973, 27387476, 30396722). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pt.) has been reached. In summary, GATA3 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant hypoparathyroidism-deafness-renal disease syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hearing Loss Gene Curation Expert Panel on 6/18/19.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ec253f09-fa43-4cb4-a03b-c1e21d32d58a","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/afb6e0d5-81a5-439a-a498-9edc8505a367","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/afb6e0d5-81a5-439a-a498-9edc8505a367_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/afb6e0d5-81a5-439a-a498-9edc8505a367_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2019-06-18T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/afb6e0d5-81a5-439a-a498-9edc8505a367_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/afb6e0d5-81a5-439a-a498-9edc8505a367_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3b8603e6-347d-4fbe-9410-0a3f6728b744","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/995c9185-ba83-42b1-add7-6a3e2f0f0994","type":"Finding","dc:description":"A significant decrease in outer hair cells (OHC) numbers in heterozygous null mice shortly after birth, suggesting premature death of OHCs during embryonic development. Number of inner hair cells (IHC) was normal. Surviving OHCs matured normally, but IHCs failed to acquire the characteristic mature basolateral currents and to down-regulate the immature-type channels like to the cholinergic efferent systems. This shows gata3 affects all hair cell, but it affects OHCs and IHCs differently. \n\nIHC numbers are maintained in gata3+/− mice, their biophysical differentiation is incomplete and could contribute to the observed hearing loss both in the mouse model and in HDR syndrome.\n\nAdult gata3+/− mice (>1 month old) suffer general morphological degeneration of cochlear sensory cells, especially of OHCs, in young adults. \n\nAbsence of any effect in gata3+/fl otof-cre+/− mice suggests less sensitivity to gata3 haploinsufficiency in IHCs during early postnatal development. Results predict measurable hearing loss without loss of DPOAEs in gata3fl/fl otof-cre+/− mice. The ABR thresholds were largely elevated, although they were not as severe as for gata3+/− mice at a comparable age  At 1.7 months, gata3fl/fl otof-cre+/− mice had about 20 dB of hearing loss across all frequencies, whereas the gata3+/− mice had a 30 dB loss. \nFull knock-down of gata3 in IHCs led to progressive hearing loss, which becomes profound by 7 months. Such progression was not observed in gata3+/− mice, although it might have been masked by the background loss with age for the mouse strain. This shows gata3 is necessary in IHCs at least during early adult life. \n\nAuthors assert that hearing loss in patients with HDR syndrome is probably due to combined defects in both sensory hair cell types.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31069810","rdfs:label":"Bardhan mouse model","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/661e448d-2c71-4eb9-9b6d-88c94fc4b9e5","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Downgraded due to zygosity differences between model and AD mode of inheritance/scored probands.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3ec10213-64a7-4049-bdb9-48fa89c4b688","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Heterozygous knock-out mice appeared healthy and fertile, with a normal laboratory life span.
