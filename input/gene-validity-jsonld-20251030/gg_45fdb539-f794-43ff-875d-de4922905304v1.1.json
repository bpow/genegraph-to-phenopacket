The only published evidence supporting the association is a de novo case (Nishi et al., 2015). The MAP2K1 gene is also located in the Ras/MAPK pathway, which is associated with the NSML phenotype (Aoki et al., 2016; Rauen, 2013). Of note, MAP2K1 is classified as Definitive in association with cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome, as Limited in association with NS, and as Disputed in association with Costello syndrome. The ClinGen RASopathy Expert Panel found no evidence associating MAP2K1 with NS-like disorder with loose anagen hair. This curation was approved by the ClinGen RASopathy Gene Curation Expert Panel on 5/29/18 (SOP Version 5).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/45fdb539-f794-43ff-875d-de4922905304","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ee3071d5-ea0d-4804-ad61-3c6471f6a47e","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","changes":{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ee3071d5-ea0d-4804-ad61-3c6471f6a47e_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10021","date":"2021-03-10T15:36:22.623Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ee3071d5-ea0d-4804-ad61-3c6471f6a47e_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10021","date":"2018-05-29T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ee3071d5-ea0d-4804-ad61-3c6471f6a47e_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ee3071d5-ea0d-4804-ad61-3c6471f6a47e_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f27e7c70-218a-4fed-8314-b50be2b9ece2","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d0ff32e3-6d6a-442a-9933-cfe693807c2d","type":"Finding","dc:description":"The MAP2K1 gene is an established gen in the RAS pathway which is associated with NSML","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23875798","rdfs:label":"MAP2K1 in RAS/MAPK pathway","demonstrates":{"id":"obo:MI_0915"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ee3071d5-ea0d-4804-ad61-3c6471f6a47e_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ee3071d5-ea0d-4804-ad61-3c6471f6a47e_ad_dn_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b704c4fe-b003-4d80-ba85-9e31b0382ba4_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"This paper was a case study on a Japanese boy clinically diagnosed with NSML and a variant in MAP2K1.
