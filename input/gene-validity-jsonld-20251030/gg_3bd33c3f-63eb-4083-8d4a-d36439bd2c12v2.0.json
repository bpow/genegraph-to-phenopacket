One variant (c.466A>G p.M156V) has been reported in one proband in one publication (PMID: 28013291) and is included in this curation. The variant was shown to segregate in the presented kindred with a LOD score of 2.1. The mechanism of pathogenicity is reported to be LOF. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by an animal model and rescue of the phenotype as well as expression level data (PMID: 28013291). In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the Hearing Loss GCEP on 04/24/2018. It was reevaluated on 11/16/2022. As a result of this reevaluation, the classification did not change from limited (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3bd33c3f-63eb-4083-8d4a-d36439bd2c12","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3ddbe083-55c3-483b-8c32-fc9bdbef10c6","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","changes":[{"id":"cg:sopChange"},{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"},{"id":"cg:summaryChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3ddbe083-55c3-483b-8c32-fc9bdbef10c6_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2022-11-22T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3ddbe083-55c3-483b-8c32-fc9bdbef10c6_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2022-12-15T18:09:42.141Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3ddbe083-55c3-483b-8c32-fc9bdbef10c6_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3ddbe083-55c3-483b-8c32-fc9bdbef10c6_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8b390cf3-97c0-41ae-840d-89b3d2265020","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/af9c44f3-ba51-4e4b-8f3f-34e8e8dc69b6","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Expression-RT-PCR: showed developmental expression in otic vesicle, pectoral fin and midbrain suggesting involvement in hearing development.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28013291","rdfs:label":"Expression of SLC44A4 involvement in hearing development","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c1560322-76d9-4476-9331-5b29f76a6535","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"These experiments did not directly implicate SLC44A4 in HL, though they did study expression in various tissues of rats, they didn't study expression in the inner ear.","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Inconclusive","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bbd6053c-891e-4d4d-a492-ae4a8ad6ea63","type":"Finding","dc:description":"These experiments did not directly implicate SLC44A4 in HL","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10677542","rdfs:label":"Choline uptake of CTL1-4","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/658697c6-53c7-46da-9fa4-09725f9758d4","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Evidence of SLC44A4 function, does not directly implicate in disease.","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Inconclusive","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/06be6f72-b2e0-47e7-a8ed-4b607ec912a6","type":"Finding","dc:description":"not direct evidence for hearing loss.
