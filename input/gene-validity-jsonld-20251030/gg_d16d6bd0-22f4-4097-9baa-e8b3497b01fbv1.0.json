Of note, *AP1G1* has also been implicated in autosomal recessive complex neurodevelopmental disorder (Usmani-Riazuddin syndrome, autosomal recessive). The split curation for Usmani-Riazuddin syndrome, autosomal recessive, is assessed separately.\n\n*AP1G1*-related autosomal dominant complex neurodevelopmental disorder (also known as Usmani-Riazuddin syndrome, autosomal dominant) is characterized by global developmental delay with variably impaired intellectual development, speech delay, and behavioral abnormalities, including aggression, hyperactivity, and autism spectrum disorder or autistic features. Additional common features include seizures, hypotonia, and distal limb anomalies. Five de novo missense variants and three de novo loss-of-function variants have been reported in nine unrelated patients (PMID: 34102099). This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence. AP1G1  interacts with other adaptor protein complex 1 (AP-1) proteins, AP1S1/AP1S2, which have been definitively implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders. AP complexes mediate selective intracellular vesicular trafficking and polarized localization of somatodendritic proteins in neurons.\n\nIn summary, there is strong evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel on November 2, 2022 (SOP Version 9).\n\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d16d6bd0-22f4-4097-9baa-e8b3497b01fb","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b3519527-9a80-4f0e-9ea6-c4244eb2ee33","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Strong","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b3519527-9a80-4f0e-9ea6-c4244eb2ee33_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2022-11-02T19:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b3519527-9a80-4f0e-9ea6-c4244eb2ee33_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2024-02-19T20:51:19.207Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b3519527-9a80-4f0e-9ea6-c4244eb2ee33_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/da412a56-a359-4419-b9f3-45c89133948f","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/da412a56-a359-4419-b9f3-45c89133948f_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"Expression of the variant in HEK293 cells showed that the variant is associated with increased AP1G1 protein expression, formed abnormal aggregates with the wild type protein;
