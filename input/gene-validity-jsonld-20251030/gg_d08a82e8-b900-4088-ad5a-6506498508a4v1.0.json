{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d08a82e8-b900-4088-ad5a-6506498508a4v1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"*NOTCH2* was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant Hajdu-Cheney syndrome-*NOTCH2* in 2011 (Simpson et al., 2011 PMID: 21378985). This condition is characterized by acroosteolysis of distal phalanges and generalized osteoporosis, associated with additional ossification anomalies, craniofacial dysmorphism, dental anomalies and a wide range of other characteristics. Hearing loss, renal cysts, and cardiovascular anomalies are variably present. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting guidelines, we found differences in molecular mechanism and phenotypic variability. Therefore, *NOTCH2* related phenotypes have been split into two disease entities, Alagille syndrome-*NOTCH2* and Hajdu-Cheney syndrome-*NOTCH2*. Hajdu-Cheney syndrome-*NOTCH2* has been lumped with serpentine fibula-polycystic kidney syndrome into a single entity, Hajdu-Cheney syndrome-*NOTCH2*, based on shared molecular mechanism and phenotypic spectrum. The split curation for autosomal dominant Alagille syndrome-*NOTCH2* has been handled separately. Thirty-one variants (truncating variants in exon 34 that disrupt the PEST domain) that have been reported in 31 probands in nine publications (PMIDs: 21378985, 21378989, 39748536, 27312922, 36079132, 23401378, 21681853, 35289498, 21793104) in Hajdu-Cheney syndrome-*NOTCH2* are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) was reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is truncating variants in exon 34 which escape nonsense-mediated decay and disrupt the PEST domain (PMID: 21378985), which appear to act through a gain-of-function mechanism (PMID: 29149593). This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence, including functional alterations in non-patient cells, altered expression in patient cells, and two mouse models (PMIDs: 39745791, 29149593, 20299358, 26627824). In summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *NOTCH2* and autosomal dominant Hajdu-Cheney syndrome-*NOTCH2*. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Kidney Cystic and Ciliopathy Disorders GCEP on the meeting date April 14, 2025 (SOP Version 11).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d08a82e8-b900-4088-ad5a-6506498508a4","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4038bee8-e900-4c78-b417-9ea1adad697d","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4038bee8-e900-4c78-b417-9ea1adad697d_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10066","date":"2025-06-26T15:28:04.586Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4038bee8-e900-4c78-b417-9ea1adad697d_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10066","date":"2025-04-14T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4038bee8-e900-4c78-b417-9ea1adad697d_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4038bee8-e900-4c78-b417-9ea1adad697d_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/92697200-deef-4677-b6b3-539a8f38bb50","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/99968e4c-60b8-46f1-b9f9-a9355dd0964f","type":"Finding","dc:description":"A mouse strain was generated with activated Notch2 in Six2-containing nephron progenitor cells of the metanephric mesenchyme.
