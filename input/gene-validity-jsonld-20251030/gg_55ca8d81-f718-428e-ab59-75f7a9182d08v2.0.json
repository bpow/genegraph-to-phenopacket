The maximum amount of scorable genetic evidence has been published showing de novo as well as non-de novo variants occur in MAP2K2 in patients with CFC (Narumi et al., 2007; Nava et al., 2007; Nystrom et al., 2008; Rodriguez-Viciana, Tetsu, et al., 2006). The MAP2K2 gene is also located in the Ras/MAPK pathway, which is associated with the CFC phenotype (Aoki et al., 2016; Rauen, 2013). Of note, MAP2K2 is also classified as Limited in association with Noonan syndrome (NS). The ClinGen RASopathy Expert Panel found no evidence associating MAP2K2 with NS with multiple lentigines, NS-like disorder with loose anagen hair, or Costello syndrome. This curation was approved by the ClinGen RASopathy Gene Curation Expert Panel on 7/24/18 (SOP Version 5).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/55ca8d81-f718-428e-ab59-75f7a9182d08","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7765e2a4-19e4-4b15-9233-4847606fc501","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7765e2a4-19e4-4b15-9233-4847606fc501_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10021","date":"2018-07-24T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7765e2a4-19e4-4b15-9233-4847606fc501_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10021","date":"2021-03-10T15:45:03.716Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7765e2a4-19e4-4b15-9233-4847606fc501_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7765e2a4-19e4-4b15-9233-4847606fc501_ad_other_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a29fe1a9-0b7c-4461-8bdd-1ca07451476f_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"This paper is a case report of a familial case of CFCS with a patient and his father carrying the same MAP2K2 variant.
