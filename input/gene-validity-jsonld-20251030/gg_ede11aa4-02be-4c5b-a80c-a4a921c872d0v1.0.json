At least two unique splicing variants have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 2 probands in 2 publications (PMID: 22818856, 25635128). This gene-disease association is supported by expression studies and an animal model. In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ede11aa4-02be-4c5b-a80c-a4a921c872d0","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/886b45ae-232d-4635-ab94-88a0d15bbcca","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/886b45ae-232d-4635-ab94-88a0d15bbcca_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10031","date":"2019-12-09T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/886b45ae-232d-4635-ab94-88a0d15bbcca_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10031","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"Only 2 unrelated probands with mutations in the gene were scored.
