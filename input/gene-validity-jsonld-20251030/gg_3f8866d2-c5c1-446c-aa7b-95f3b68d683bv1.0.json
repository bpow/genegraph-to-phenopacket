{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3f8866d2-c5c1-446c-aa7b-95f3b68d683bv1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"The relationship between *C1QBP* and primary mitochondrial disease was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of August 15, 2022. The *C1QBP* gene encodes complement component C1q-binding protein. This protein is a multifunctional chaperone predicted to have roles in inflammation and infection processes, mitochondrial ribosome biogenesis, regulation of apoptosis, regulation of nuclear transcription, and mitochondrial homeostasis. \n\nThe *C1QBP* gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive primary mitochondrial disease in 2017 (PMID: 28942965). While various names have been given to the constellation of features seen in those with *C1QBP*-related disease, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *C1QBP* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included 10 unique variants (seven missense variants, one in-frame deletion, one frameshift, and one deletion) identified in 11 probands (14 cases total) from seven publications (PMIDs: 28942965, 32652806, 33344382, 33977026, 34419324, 34003581, 35119291).   Age of onset in affected individuals varied from in utero to the sixth decade, and outcomes similarly varied from stillbirth/death in first days of life to alive at more than 60 years of age. Features included hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (not seen in all; one case had a successful heart transplant), ophthalmoplegia, ptosis, exercise intolerance, muscle weakness, intrauterine growth restriction, and oligohydramnios. There were no commonalities on imaging. Tissue biopsies identified multiple large scale mtDNA deletions in skeletal muscle and heart; ragged red fibers, ragged blue fibers, and decreased COX histochemical activity in muscle; aggregates of a large number of mitochondria of varying size, altered cristae, parking lot inclusions, unusual triangular crystalline inclusion in muscle; and lipid droplets in liver. Mitochondrial DNA content was increased at 250% of controls in muscle and 600% in liver. Lab values showed lactic acidosis, metabolic acidosis, and elevated CK. Some affected individuals had normal mitochondrial respiratory chain enzyme activities while others had decreased activities of complexes I, III, and IV in muscle and liver. Complex I, IV, V intact steady-state levels were decreased in muscle by BN-PAGE. These levels were normal in some subjects’ cultured fibroblasts and others showed decreased CI and CIV in cultured fibroblasts. The mechanism of disease appears to be loss of function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by a biochemical function shared with other genes associated with primary mitochondrial disease, functional alteration in patient cells, and model systems (PMIDs: 35310974, 28498888, 9305894, 22904065, 29123152).\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support this gene-disease relationship, including that more than three years have elapsed since the first proposal of the association. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on August 15, 2022 (SOP Version 9).
