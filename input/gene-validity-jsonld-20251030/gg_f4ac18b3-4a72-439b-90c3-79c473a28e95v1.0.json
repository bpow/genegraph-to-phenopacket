Three variants (a missense, a nonsense, and a chromosomal segment deletion) that have been reported in three probands in two publications (PMIDs: 10053005, 25516202) are included in this curation. However, none were scored. The missense and nonsense mutations are too frequent in the general population, and the chromosomal segment deletion included other CHD-associated genes. The only experimental evidence, a mouse model, was not scored due to the lack of scorable genetic evidence and only a low portion of mice exhibiting cardiac anomalies (PMID: 11703930). In summary, the evidence supporting the relationship between *LEFTY2* and autosomal dominant congenital heart disease has been disputed and no valid evidence remains to support the claim. More evidence is needed to either support or entirely refute the role *LEFTY2* plays in this disease. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Congenital Heart Disease GCEP on the meeting date 2/6/2022 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f4ac18b3-4a72-439b-90c3-79c473a28e95","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7b409905-0612-4f4a-88e1-2fd978cf4554","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"NoKnownDiseaseRelationship","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7b409905-0612-4f4a-88e1-2fd978cf4554_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10130","date":"2024-02-06T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7b409905-0612-4f4a-88e1-2fd978cf4554_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10130","date":"2024-03-29T21:38:26.390Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"There is no scorable genetic evidence, and thus the only experimental evidence, a mouse model, was not scored.
