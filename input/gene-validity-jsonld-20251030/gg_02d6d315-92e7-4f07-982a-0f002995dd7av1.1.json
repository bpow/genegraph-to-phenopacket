Earlier evidence suggested that the disease MEN2B mapped to chromosome 10 (where the RET gene is located) as early as 1990 (Norum et al., 1990 PMID:1979053). One variant, p.Met918Thr, is responsible for nearly all cases of MEN2B, and it is estimated that around 50% of the reported cases of MEN2B are de novo (Carlson et al. 1994 PMID:7977365; Plaza-Menaho et al., 2006; PMID: 16979782). Another RET variant (p. Ala883Phe) has been asserted to be responsible for the development of ~5% of MEN2B (Smith et al., 1997 PMID:9294615). The molecular mechanism for the gene RET in the disease entity MEN2B is gain of function. While similar to RET-MEN2A (described in a separate curation), in that the mechanism is GOF, the mechanism(s) responsible for the two disease entities are distinct. In MEN2B the p.Met918Thr variation occurs in exon 16 of RET in the tyrosine kinase domain which causes autophosphorylation and activation of RET. There is a significant amount of case-level data with the maximum points for genetic evidence reached (12 points). This gene-disease relationship is supported by functional studies including expression, cell assays and animal models, several that were patient derived pathogenic variants expressed in the mouse (reviewed in Wiedmann et al, 2016 PMID: 26184857). These animal models developed carcinomas consistent with the disease multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2B. The RET gene is asserted to be associated with multiple disease entities by germline inheritance , including: (1) Central hypoventilation syndrome, congenital (MIM:209880), (2) Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MIM:155240), (3) Multiple endocrine neoplasia IIA/2A (MIM:171400), (4)Pheochromocytoma (MIM:171300). These disease entities all follow an inheritance pattern of autosomal dominant. Per the criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we did find a difference in the molecular mechanism (defined above) and phenotypic expressivity between the disease entities MEN2A (MIM:171400) and MEN2B (162300), and therefore have split these curations. Therefore, the curation for RET-MEN2A can be found separately. In summary, RET is DEFINITIVELY associated with autosomal dominant multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2B. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/02d6d315-92e7-4f07-982a-0f002995dd7a","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5e4425f0-0900-43c3-aac4-5b37554be386","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5e4425f0-0900-43c3-aac4-5b37554be386_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10023","date":"2020-05-14T01:03:45.543Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5e4425f0-0900-43c3-aac4-5b37554be386_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10023","date":"2020-09-16T19:22:58.275Z","role":"Publisher"},{"agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10018","role":"SecondaryContributor"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5e4425f0-0900-43c3-aac4-5b37554be386_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5e4425f0-0900-43c3-aac4-5b37554be386_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d69e745f-a52b-4c98-9683-370aa085b7d0","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7e934912-5a21-4554-885a-0c9f713ad8ef","type":"Finding","dc:description":"According to RNA-seq data on NCBI gene site, the highest expression of RET was found in the adrenal gland of normal, control tissue.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24309898","rdfs:label":"RET is expressed in human adrenal gland","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5e4425f0-0900-43c3-aac4-5b37554be386_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f459f790-e895-4ef6-9cd6-dc8f26b8df55","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9647ffa3-1802-44b1-9d15-e5b90adfd9d6","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Experimental studies have shown that the RET c.2753T>C, p.Met918Thr missense change results in activation of the RET protein, leading to increased transforming capacity and cellular differentiation (PMID: 8570194, 9242375, 21810974, 16715139).","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21810974","rdfs:label":"Aggressive transforming ability with constitutive activation"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5e4425f0-0900-43c3-aac4-5b37554be386_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/01bc1378-9644-4b12-8c3a-893b80e563a6","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Given that this review article highlights three independently generated mouse models of MEN2B with mice harboring the highly prevalent M918T variant in RET, one having a the patient derived mutation knocked into the mouse RET locus,  and all show development of tumors consistent with disease I am increasing the default points.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/be4d45fa-f384-4adf-b0d1-ab5c23784476","type":"Finding","dc:description":"The Ret^MEN2B/+ heterozygous mice generated by Smith-Hicks et al., 2000 (PMID: 10675330) developed thyroid C-cell hyperplasia (CCH), adrenal chromaffin cell hyperplasia and peochromocytoma.
