The *PDLIM3* gene has been associated with HCM in 2 probands in 2 publications. One variant of unknown significance and 1 multi-exon deletion have been reported. The multi-exon deletion was given 1.0 point for genetic evidence although it could not be officially scored as breakpoints were not provided, inhibiting the ability to enter the deletion into the ClinGen Allele Registry, at the time. *PDLIM3* is expressed in heart and interacts with *ACTN2*. However, there is no known mechanism through which *PDLIM3* causes HCM. In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship with HCM. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease association. This classification was originally approved by the ClinGen Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Gene Curation Expert Panel on November 1, 2016.This gene-disease relationship was reevaluated on February 23, 2023 by the Hereditary Cardiovascular Disorders GCEP. As a result of this reevaluation, the classification did not change.\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/283b63e4-8b76-4f0a-a432-3d908b0461cc","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/76cba060-8080-42b1-b9ea-2193fea658b0","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"NoKnownDiseaseRelationship","changes":[{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},{"id":"cg:sopChange"},{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"},{"id":"cg:expertPanelChange"},{"id":"cg:newEvidence"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/76cba060-8080-42b1-b9ea-2193fea658b0_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10104","date":"2023-02-23T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/76cba060-8080-42b1-b9ea-2193fea658b0_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10104","date":"2023-04-12T22:31:00.781Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"Of note, there is genetic evidence from one proband with a partial deletion (first four exons) of PDLIM3.
