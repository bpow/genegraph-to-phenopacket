Therefore, the following disease entities have been split; autosomal dominant hypopigmentation, organomegaly, and delayed myelination and development (HOD; OMIM: 618541), autosomal recessive osteopetrosis (OMIM: 611490), and autosomal dominant osteopetrosis (OMIM: 166600). The osteopetrosis disorders will be curated by the ClinGen Skeletal GCEP. \n\nTwo unrelated individuals with HOD have been reported to date and neither of them has any evidence of osteopetrosis (Nicoli et al, 2019, PMID: 31155284). Both individuals have striking hypopigmentation of the hair and skin, organomegaly, delayed myelination, and motor delay. Histological findings in various tissues are consistent with a lysosomal storage disorder, and pH in the lysosomes of cultured skin fibroblasts was shown to be reduced. Both patients have the same de novo variant, p.Tyr715Cys, in CLCN7. When the variant was expressed in Xenopus oocytes (with the gene encoding its beta-subunit, Ostm1) there was about a 3-fold increase in outward currents compared to wild type. Furthermore, overexpression of the variant in fibroblasts resulted in enlarged cytoplasmic vacuoles, recapitulating the features noted in fibroblasts from the patients. Later, the variant was shown to prevent negative regulation by the signaling lipid signaling lipid PI(3,5)P2, causing lysosomal hyperacidifcation, as seen in cells from patients (PMID: 35670560). The variant is absent in gnomAD v4.0. (Total for genetic evidence = 3 points).\n\nThis gene-disease relationship is supported by further experimental evidence including the function of CLCN7 (Clc-7), a Cl- /H+ antiporter that localizes to late endosomes and lysosomes and which is involved in ionic homeostasis of those compartments (Lin et al, 2021, PMID: 33495814; Feng et al, 2023, PMID: 37191899). This role is consistent with the histological findings and lysosomal hyperacidification observed in patients. The features of a mouse with a heterozygous knock in of a variant equivalent to the human p.Tyr715Cys variant closely recapitulate the phenotype of affected human patients (Nicoli et al, 2019, PMID: 31155284). More evidence is available in the literature but the maximum for experimental evidence (6 points) has been reached.\n\nIn summary, there is moderate evidence supporting the relationship between CLCN7 and “hypopigmentation, organomegaly, and delayed myelination and development”. Of note, to date only two individuals have been identified, both of whom have the same de novo variant in CLCN7 (p.Tyr715Cys). It is not known if any other variants in this gene will cause the HOD phenotype. However, experimental evidence suggests that other variants at the same position may have a similar impact (PMID: 35670560). This classification was approved by the ClinGen Lysosomal Diseases GCEP on December 5, 2023 (SOP Version 10).\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a332b81b-c240-40de-a6d6-907a85fcd22f","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0e47aa25-2107-4e36-8fa8-f9e81eb9de69","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10065","role":"SecondaryContributor"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0e47aa25-2107-4e36-8fa8-f9e81eb9de69_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10110","date":"2023-12-05T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0e47aa25-2107-4e36-8fa8-f9e81eb9de69_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10110","date":"2023-12-06T15:58:40.377Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0e47aa25-2107-4e36-8fa8-f9e81eb9de69_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0e47aa25-2107-4e36-8fa8-f9e81eb9de69_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3403ef91-246d-458b-9293-aa92f4062d37","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The features in this mouse with a knock in of a variant identified in 2 patients strongly recpitulates the features in those patients.
