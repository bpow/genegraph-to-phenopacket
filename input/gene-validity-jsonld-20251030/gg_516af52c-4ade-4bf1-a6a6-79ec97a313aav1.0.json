Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data from 5 probands in 5 publications (PMIDs: 11114175, 23489661, 25529940, 36380287, 36774715), with four unique variants (3 missense and 1 splice site) predominantly found in the filament assembly region except for Glu706Lys in the SH1 helix domain. A dominant negative mechanism has been suggested however has not been established. This gene-disease association is also supported by experimental evidence, including expression evidence (PMID: 7545970) in type IIa muscle fibers, functional alteration in patient cells (PMID: 17005402), and a C. elegans model (PMID: 16130113). In summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship.\n\nOf note, *MYH2* has also been reported in relation to autosomal recessive proximal myopathy and ophthalmoplegia. Due to the proposed difference in mechanism, loss of function, those cases were considered in a separate curation.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/516af52c-4ade-4bf1-a6a6-79ec97a313aa","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/76685544-e687-4b2e-8656-2960d0324eee","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/76685544-e687-4b2e-8656-2960d0324eee_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10031","date":"2024-06-10T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/76685544-e687-4b2e-8656-2960d0324eee_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10031","date":"2024-06-10T16:44:07.297Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/76685544-e687-4b2e-8656-2960d0324eee_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/dcf41abc-5d9d-4fb1-be7c-e159a9380f07","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The NM_017534.6:c.5609T>C (p.Leu1870Pro) variant reported in this patient in heterozygosity alters a highly conserved amino acid in the coiled-coil tail domain.
