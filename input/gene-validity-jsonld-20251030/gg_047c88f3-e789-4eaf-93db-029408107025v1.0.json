Five unique variants (nonsense, gross deletion, promoter) that have been reported in five individuals with CHD are included in this curation (PMID: 25077177, 30390123, 31484864, 32820510, 34260301). The mechanism of pathogenicity is predicted to be loss-of-function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by evidence of *ISL1* expression in both the human and murine fetal heart, biochemical function studies showing the role of *Isl1/Brg1-Baf60c* complex in cardiogenesis, and two mouse models (knockout and hypomorphic) showing severe developmental defects of the mutant heart (PMIDs: 19571884, 14667410, 31024170). In summary, *ISL1* is definitively associated with autosomal dominant congenital heart disease. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Congenital Heart Disease GCEP on the meeting date August 6th, 2024 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/047c88f3-e789-4eaf-93db-029408107025","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ad4a2c95-f9fb-45a3-84e4-2e1d0d71c779","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ad4a2c95-f9fb-45a3-84e4-2e1d0d71c779_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10130","date":"2024-08-06T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ad4a2c95-f9fb-45a3-84e4-2e1d0d71c779_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10130","date":"2024-09-11T22:54:06.687Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ad4a2c95-f9fb-45a3-84e4-2e1d0d71c779_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ad4a2c95-f9fb-45a3-84e4-2e1d0d71c779_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/64bcd3e0-1f5e-4658-9b98-a9183196938f","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Downgraded since the phenotype was observed in homozygous null mutants while the disease is dominant in humans","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/835a669e-e2a5-4506-ac0e-1c7098914357","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Targeted disruption of the Isl1 in mouse results in embryonic death due to severe developmental defects of the heart, including loss of the outfow tract, right ventricle, and much of the atria.
