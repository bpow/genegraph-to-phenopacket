This association was made using case-level data. For the purpose of this curation, 9​ variants (missense, in-frame del, nonsense, frameshift) have been reported in humans. Association is seen in at least 7 probands in 4 publications (12754709, 16151413, 21446023, 21602428). Many more evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. A meta-analysis was performed by de Heredia et al. 2013, of published Wolfram syndrome cases from 1998 to 2013 (23429432). This gene-disease association is supported by a homozygous null WFS1 mouse model and relevant expression studies. Of note, this gene has been separately curated for its association with autosomal dominant disease. In summary, WFS1 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive Wolfram syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hearing Loss​ Working Group on 4/17/18.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9636a297-d474-4cca-83d3-1174def4835c","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1e81eeda-4dd0-431c-ad52-90304fb761c8","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1e81eeda-4dd0-431c-ad52-90304fb761c8_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1e81eeda-4dd0-431c-ad52-90304fb761c8_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2018-04-17T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1e81eeda-4dd0-431c-ad52-90304fb761c8_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1e81eeda-4dd0-431c-ad52-90304fb761c8_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f6a1382c-db51-4f61-a69b-49b85a657577","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Retinal ganglion cells were not significantly absent, indicating mouse is not perfect model of optic atrophy phenotype in humans.
