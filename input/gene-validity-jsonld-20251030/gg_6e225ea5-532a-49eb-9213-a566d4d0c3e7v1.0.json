The specific disease entity, Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (MONDO:0016575), OMIM:603336), is one of at least 45 different primary ciliary dyskinesias distinguished by a single monogenic cause. Some of the most common patient phenotypes are: Absent sperm flagella, Absent sperm axoneme central pair complex, Male infertility, Reduced sperm motility, Abnormal sperm head morphology, Short sperm flagella and Coiled sperm flagella. The probands who have DNAH6 variants exhibit a spectrum of phenotypes that include infertility due to spermatogenic failure and abnormal sperm motility and morphology. Currently, none of the monogenic probands in the literature display respiratory features characteristic of primary ciliary dyskinesia. Per the recommendations of the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, the GCEP decided to split and perform separate curations for both gene-diseases entities: One curation for the relationship between DNAH6 and PCD and another one for the relationship between DNAH6 and Spermatogenic Failure. This curation is focused on the relationship between DNAH6 and Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia.\n\nSixteen variants: (4 types of genetic mutations: Missense (12), Splice Site (2),Frameshift (1) and Nonsense (1) that have been reported in 11 probands in 7 publications (PMIDs: 26918822, 37424858, 37594300, 29356036, 31676830, 34089056 and 28206990) are included in this curation.\n\nMost of the siblings of the probands were also found to be affected with similar phenotypes to varying degrees of severity and were similarly genotyped. However, the fertility status of all of the siblings was not known.\n\nOverall, the mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss of function as shown by the suspected disease-causing variants in the probands. \n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by multiple forms of experimental evidence such as Expression A (Quantity: 1), Biochemical Function A (Quantity: 1), Model System: Zebrafish (Danio rerio) (Quantity: 1) and Model System: Cell Culture (Quantity: 1). First, GTex data showed that DNAH6 is primarily expressed in fallopian tubes and lungs, which is consistent with PCD phenotypes (PMID: 23715323).Wilken et al. 2024 found that both DNAH6 and DNAH1 are both IDA components and localized to the same region (PMID: 39056782). DNAH1 was classified as having a \"limited\" relationship with PCD 37 and a “defintive” relationship with spermatogenic failure 18 by the Motile Ciliopathy GCEP. Refer to the curation for further details. Next, Li et al. 2016 (PMID:26918822) contained a zebrafish model.The immotile cilia found in the model is similar to the immotile sperm seen in human probands. Additionally, the abnormal ciliary motility seen in the model is similar to the reduced sperm motility found in the human probands. The model presented a severe defect that led to a significant curvature of the spine, which has similarity to the coiled sperm found in human probands. Next, a shDNAH6 knockdown of human respiratory epithelia showed that the abnormal ciliary motility found in the model recapitulates the abnormality of sperm motility found in the human probands (Li et al. 2016, PMID:26918822).\n\nIn conclusion, DNAH6 has a disputed association with Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia. This classification has been clearly demonstrated and confirmed through both experimental and genetic evidence and has been upheld over time. \n\nThis classification was approved by the Motile Ciliopathy GCEP on January 9th, 2025 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6e225ea5-532a-49eb-9213-a566d4d0c3e7","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0e919f48-1c90-45d9-b909-9a619e4e71d0","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"NoKnownDiseaseRelationship","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0e919f48-1c90-45d9-b909-9a619e4e71d0_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10102","date":"2025-01-09T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0e919f48-1c90-45d9-b909-9a619e4e71d0_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10102","date":"2025-03-31T17:10:38.083Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"At this time, the only DNAH6 variant containing individuals present in the literature have limited to no features of PCD.

In contrast, the mother is heterozygous for the DNAI1 IVS1+2_3insT allele, but is wildtype for the DNAH6 allele.","phenotypeFreeText":"Genotyping analysis showed the DNAH6 mutation in patient 9002 was inherited from the unaffected father, while the pathogenic DNAI1 mutation was inherited from the unaffected mother (Fig 2B and S1 Fig).\n\nWe note previous nasal biopsy of patient 9002 showed abnormally short and sparse cilia, and videomicroscopy showed the cilia were mostly immotile. Here we further show with immunostaining, that DNAH6 was retained in the ciliary axoneme of patient 9002 (Fig 2C). This is not unexpected, since the patient has a heterozygous wildtype DNAH6 allele.\n\nPatient 9002 has a splicing defect DNAI1 founder mutation.","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0012776","obo:HP_0012263","obo:HP_0030853"],"sex":"Male","variant":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b1c7eeb7-39c2-4111-9197-4115a0279c0a_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8f04a07b-933c-4d9d-b8c5-51f08ada79a1_variant_evidence_item"}]}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria","strengthScore":0},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/dc044f1b-82bc-4fa8-9d41-c7159fc55cbb_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/40d49cf8-4587-434f-b488-a4a6761a408e","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The proband was not diagnosed with PCD.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/40d49cf8-4587-434f-b488-a4a6761a408e_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"Functional Evidence: To investigate the sperm head and flagellar ultrastructure of men with bi-allelic DNAH6 variants, we performed TEM analyses of samples obtained from the men (Figure 3).","functionalDataSupport":"Yes"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/40d49cf8-4587-434f-b488-a4a6761a408e_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37594300","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c2222ddb-fc8b-449d-bb3c-2b68db4c03c8","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001370.2(DNAH6):c.8726A>G (p.Gln2909Arg)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA347530787"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":0},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/062bcd4a-8f50-4043-969f-4bbc9f0f973a","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The proband was not diagnosed with PCD.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/062bcd4a-8f50-4043-969f-4bbc9f0f973a_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"Functional Evidence: To investigate the sperm head and flagellar ultrastructure of men with bi-allelic DNAH6 variants, we performed TEM analyses of samples obtained from the men (Figure 3).","functionalDataSupport":"Yes"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/062bcd4a-8f50-4043-969f-4bbc9f0f973a_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37594300","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/23134bdb-ab44-4934-8291-3c4fa0b891a3","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001370.2(DNAH6):c.5264C>T (p.Thr1755Ile)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA347469876"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":0},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/dc044f1b-82bc-4fa8-9d41-c7159fc55cbb","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37594300","rdfs:label":"AY0334","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":30,"allele":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c2222ddb-fc8b-449d-bb3c-2b68db4c03c8"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/23134bdb-ab44-4934-8291-3c4fa0b891a3"}],"detectionMethod":"WES and confirmed by Sanger.","phenotypeFreeText":"Two novel compound heterozygous variants of DNAH6 from patient AY0334 (c.5264C>T, p.T1755I;
