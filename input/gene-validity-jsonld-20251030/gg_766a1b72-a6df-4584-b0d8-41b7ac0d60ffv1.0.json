{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/766a1b72-a6df-4584-b0d8-41b7ac0d60ffv1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"The relationship between *NDUFA10* and primary mitochondrial disease was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of November 6, 2023. *NDUFA10* encodes NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) subunit A10, a non-catalytic complex I accessory protein required for complex I assembly and function within the mitochondria. Defects of this protein lead to complex I deficiency. \n\n*NDUFA10* was first reported in relation to primary mitochondrial disease in 2011 (PMID: 21150889), in a boy with a confirmed neuropathological diagnosis of Leigh syndrome. While various names could be given to the constellation of features seen in those with *NDUFA10*-related disease, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *NDUFA10* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework. Of note, *NDUFA10* was previously curated by this GCEP on June 10, 2019 (SOP V6) as having a Limited association with Leigh Syndrome Spectrum (LSS). The scope of this current curation encompassed cases of primary mitochondrial disease, which includes LSS. \n  \nEvidence supporting the gene-disease relationship between *NDUFA10* and primary mitochondrial disease includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation includes nine variants (five missense, two deletions, one insertion, one frameshift) in seven probands from seven publications (PMIDs: 21150889; 22200994; 28247337; 26741492; 36270260; 35379322; 35094435). Affected individuals present with a broad phenotypic spectrum of disease which includes LSS. The age of onset ranges from birth to early childhood. Additional features seen include developmental delay, ataxia, spastic tetraparesis, seizures, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, pulmonary hypertension, and feeding difficulty. Elevated blood and cerebrospinal fluid lactates are seen. Muscle biopsies showed a complex I deficiency. Loss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. \n\nThis gene-disease association is also supported by known biochemical function and functional alteration in patient fibroblasts and in a *C. elegans* model system (PMIDs: 27509854; 27626371, 21150889, 19672299).    \n\nIn summary, there is moderate evidence to support the relationship between *NDUFA10* and primary mitochondrial disease. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on November 6, 2023 (SOP Version 9).
