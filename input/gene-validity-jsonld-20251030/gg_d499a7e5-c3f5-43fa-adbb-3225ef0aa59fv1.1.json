This disease is caused by biallelic variation in the *ARL6IP1* gene. Phenotypes involve the nervous system and the skeletal system including spasticity, scissors gait, spasticity, and polyneuropathy. More variable features may include acropathy, absent achilles tendon reflex and increased patellar reflex. Around 2 unique frameshift variants have been reported in at least 4 probands in various publications (PMID: 24482476,  2847135, 30237576, 31272422). A loss-of-function frameshift variant was also found to segregate with the disorder in additional family members with a LOD score of 3.5 (PMID: 24482476). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by showing that a knockdown of the zebrafish *ARL6IP1* ortholog causes defects in the body axis, motor neuron morphology, and spontaneous swimming behavior (PMID: 24482476).\n \nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship of the *ARL6IP1* gene with hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP). This has been repeatedly demonstrated in research and clinical diagnostic settings and upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Cerebral Palsy Gene Curation Expert Panel on 10/17/2022 (SOP Version 9). \n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d499a7e5-c3f5-43fa-adbb-3225ef0aa59f","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/58275699-f116-4243-83da-72f751753837","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/58275699-f116-4243-83da-72f751753837_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10113","date":"2022-10-17T18:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/58275699-f116-4243-83da-72f751753837_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10113","date":"2023-02-13T16:06:57.821Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/58275699-f116-4243-83da-72f751753837_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/58275699-f116-4243-83da-72f751753837_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/31621e17-b1d7-4709-9e2b-b8fa84e51b74","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6fe34051-3f16-4aed-95e0-6b67864f9168","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Although more work is warranted to conclusively uncover the role of ARL6IP1 in CST degeneration, our in vivo functional validation supports the genetic data.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24482476","rdfs:label":"Functional Testing Candidates with Expression and Zebrafish","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/58275699-f116-4243-83da-72f751753837_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e701fef0-b715-46f4-9e0c-cfd7ede3003f_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e701fef0-b715-46f4-9e0c-cfd7ede3003f","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30237576","rdfs:label":"Maddirevula 16DG0874","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":30,"allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c8d6591a-5986-4bb8-b016-dbf255aae62b","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_015161.3(ARL6IP1):c.112C>T (p.Arg38Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA394913080"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001324","obo:HP_0001319","obo:HP_0001883","obo:HP_0000218","obo:HP_0000268"],"previousTesting":false,"sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f9e77bb0-4663-4b4c-a5ee-4c147f3ab43a_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30237576","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c8d6591a-5986-4bb8-b016-dbf255aae62b"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:AlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"}}},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f9e77bb0-4663-4b4c-a5ee-4c147f3ab43a","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":3.0,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f9e77bb0-4663-4b4c-a5ee-4c147f3ab43a_variant_evidence_item"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":3.0}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria","strengthScore":3.0},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/21c3d651-52ad-449f-829d-8096d43bb57d_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/21c3d651-52ad-449f-829d-8096d43bb57d","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2847135","rdfs:label":"Nizon 11-year-old boy ","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":11,"allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f3655790-8a6b-4039-a1ee-c0f622cd94b9","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_015161.3(ARL6IP1):c.577_580del (p.Lys193PhefsTer?)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA10575626"}},"detectionMethod":"Patient's WES was performed with a minimum of 70.90% of the on-target regions which were covered to a depth of at least ×20 mean coverage. \nThis variant was confirmed by Sanger sequencing in the proband.
