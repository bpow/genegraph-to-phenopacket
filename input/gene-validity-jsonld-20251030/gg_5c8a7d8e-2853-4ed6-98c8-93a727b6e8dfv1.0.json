One single genotype analysis of rs12190287 case control is included in this curation (PMID: 28346832). However, this case control was not scored due to the variant being relatively frequent in the population. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by an animal model (PMID: 23112163). No evidence for a causal role for *TCF21* in congenital heart disease has been reported. Although this gene-disease relationship is supported by a mouse model, no reports have directly implicated the gene in humans. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Congenital Heart Disease GCEP on the meeting date June 10th, 2024 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5c8a7d8e-2853-4ed6-98c8-93a727b6e8df","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/34077807-a187-4e2c-b06b-8510fd6e5788","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"NoKnownDiseaseRelationship","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/34077807-a187-4e2c-b06b-8510fd6e5788_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10130","date":"2024-10-07T21:26:20.805Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/34077807-a187-4e2c-b06b-8510fd6e5788_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10130","date":"2024-06-10T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/34077807-a187-4e2c-b06b-8510fd6e5788_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/34077807-a187-4e2c-b06b-8510fd6e5788_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/60b429e0-e556-4de7-8267-f51de132c2d1","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e3158959-bfc6-414a-9d2c-f210d661ed5c","type":"Finding","dc:description":"TCF21 knockout mouse embryos display Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), including a VSD, overriding aorta, and pulmonic stenosis \n\n","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23112163","rdfs:label":"TCF21 knockout mouse model","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/34077807-a187-4e2c-b06b-8510fd6e5788_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0}],"evidenceStrength":"NoKnownDiseaseRelationship","sequence":9167,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria10","strengthScore":2,"subject":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/HjEo7MBP6nU","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0005453","gene":"hgnc:11632","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000005"},"version":"1.0","websiteLegacyID":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/assertion_34077807-a187-4e2c-b06b-8510fd6e5788-","@context":{"@vocab":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"},"curationReasons":{"@type":"@vocab","@container":"@set"},"GCISnapshot":{"@type":"@id"},"dc:isVersionOf":{"@type":"@id"},"websiteLegacyID":{"@type":"@id"}}}
