At least 15 unique variants (14 missense and 1 small in-frame deletion) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and segregation data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 26 probands in 9 publications (PMIDs: 18345000, 2432610, 27479822, 30051457, 31064749, 32581362, 35126455, 36507135, 34355501) and one ClinVar entry (SCV004104803.1). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in at least 34 additional family members. Experimental evidence of a functional alteration of platelet formation (PMID: 27861742) was shown in patient cells, however the normal function of CYCS in relation to platelet formation remains unclear. In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship.\n\nThis gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the HT GCEP on 2021 Jun 23. It was reevaluated on 2025 Jan 23. As a result of this reevaluation 11 additional patients were identified (PMIDs: 35126455, 36507135, 34355501, SCV004104803.1) however the classification remained Limited.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6218cb63-aec0-427e-84d0-1651bb4c2350","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/772f2ad2-5d8c-41f6-95c4-39063daf77be","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","changes":[{"id":"cg:sopChange"},{"id":"cg:newEvidence"},{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/772f2ad2-5d8c-41f6-95c4-39063daf77be_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2025-02-05T14:39:05.777Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/772f2ad2-5d8c-41f6-95c4-39063daf77be_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2025-02-05T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"The
