More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is unclear.  This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence (protein interactions) (PMID: 32110738) which confirms that POC1B interacts with FAM161A, which causes retinitis pigmentosa. In summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between POC1B and autosomal recessive retinopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.This classification was approved by the ClinGen Retina GCEP on the meeting date February, 6th, 2023.
