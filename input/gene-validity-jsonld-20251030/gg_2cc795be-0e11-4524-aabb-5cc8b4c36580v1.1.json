{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2cc795be-0e11-4524-aabb-5cc8b4c36580v1.1","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"LCA5 was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive LCA5_related retinopathy in 2007, in a patient described as having Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) (den Hollander et al., PMID: 17546029). LCA is a molecularly heterogeneous, early-onset, severe inherited retinal degeneration that typically presents within the first year of life with nystagmus and profound vision loss. Due to the heterogeneity of the phenotype and overla with other retinal conditions, such as retinitis pigmentosa, the disease entity curated is \"LCA5-related retinopathy\". \n\nSeven variants (nonsense, frameshift, and splicing) in six probands were curated. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. Majority of LCA-associated variants in the LCA5 gene are predicted loss-of-function variants (HGMD), however missense variants have also been reported to cause LCA (PMID: 24144451).  Missense and splicing variants may also be associated with a later onset of retinal degeneration (PMID: 23946133). The mechanism of pathogenicity is known to be LOF. \n\nThe LCA5 gene encodes lebercilin, a protein expressed in the connecting cilium of photoreceptors. Lebercilin interacts with other intraflagellar transport proteins required for the bidirectional movement of proteins and vesicles from the inner to outer segments of photoreceptors and is necessary for photoreceptor outer segment formation. This gene-disease association is also supported by protein expression in the retina, knockout animal models, and AAV-LCA5 rescue in the animal models (PMIDs: 21606596, 29673930, 32428231). \n\nIn summary, LCA5 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive LCA5-related retinopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2cc795be-0e11-4524-aabb-5cc8b4c36580","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ece57d88-4307-420a-aedb-4b5900248ea1","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ece57d88-4307-420a-aedb-4b5900248ea1_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10072","date":"2022-05-24T17:02:30.495Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ece57d88-4307-420a-aedb-4b5900248ea1_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10072","date":"2021-10-07T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ece57d88-4307-420a-aedb-4b5900248ea1_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ece57d88-4307-420a-aedb-4b5900248ea1_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0e373c23-5bf0-45c4-a344-be89cb204235","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/77546012-0e08-4bb0-9eb0-687d559e81b6","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Immunohistochemistry of mouse BALB/c retina (P20) showed endogenous lebercilin (SN2134) expression in the connecting cilia of mouse photoreceptors, where it colocalized with the ciliary marker polyglutamylated tubulin (GT335), and endogenous IFT complex B proteins Traf3ip1, Ift88, and IFT complex A protein Wdr19.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21606596","rdfs:label":"Immunostaining","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/de6b359d-c4c8-4c79-afcf-8dd5745641e1","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Inconclusive","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1fb91a83-19b9-41cc-bdaa-e5d0c022d847","type":"Finding","dc:description":"OFD1 variants are associated with OFD1 syndrome, Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome type 2 (SGBS2), and Joubert syndrome (JS).
