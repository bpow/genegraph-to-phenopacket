{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ff7b6e35-065f-44ec-babf-f5a0d7e47bb1v1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"*IL10*, also known as *CSIF*, was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive early-onset inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in 2010 (Glocker EO, et al., PMID: 20934598). Individuals reported to date with IL10-associated early-onset IBD have presented with IBD with an onset between 1 month and 5 years of age without additional characteristic features.\n\nThree variants (missense) that have been reported in four unrelated probands in three publications (PMIDs: 20934598, 22549091, 29248579) are included in this curation. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss of function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by animal models, expression studies, and in vitro functional assays (PMIDs: 8770874, 9312047, 15534372, 1578140, 17137799, 1827484, 22549091, 23158016). IL10 is a well-established anti-inflammatory cytokine (PMID: 1827484, 1578140, 33691712). In vitro experiments have demonstrated that mutant IL10 carrying patient-associated variants displayed impaired suppression of TNFa production by stimulated PBMCs (PMID: 22549091, 23158016). Multiple mouse models of IL10 deficiency, including *IL10*-knockout and CD4-specific *IL10* knockout mice, recapitulate the spontaneous intestinal inflammation in human disease (PMID: 8770874, 15534372). Notably, both IL10Ra and IL10RB, the subunits of the receptor with which IL10 directly interacts (PMID: 9312047), are also associated with early-onset IBD (PMID: 39795980).\n\nIn summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged.\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ff7b6e35-065f-44ec-babf-f5a0d7e47bb1","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4b07cbe7-442e-421f-8fc9-7344027dd7dc","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4b07cbe7-442e-421f-8fc9-7344027dd7dc_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10145","date":"2025-02-18T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4b07cbe7-442e-421f-8fc9-7344027dd7dc_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10145","date":"2025-03-04T17:06:48.219Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4b07cbe7-442e-421f-8fc9-7344027dd7dc_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4b07cbe7-442e-421f-8fc9-7344027dd7dc_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c0b1acc5-3c8e-4435-878f-30da455dd3bb","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"CD4-specific deletion of IL10 resulted in phenotype recapitulating human disease.
