Variants in SLC1A1 were first reported in\nhumans with this disease in 2011 (Bailey et al., PMID: 21123949). Two variants, one missense and one in-frame deletion, have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data.\nVariants in this gene have been reported in two probands in one publication by Bailey et al. Although the relationship between the gene and disease had been suspected for years beforehand, this publication characterized the first genetic evidence for this relationship. This gene-disease association is also supported by several pieces of experimental evidence, namely a well-characterized KO mouse model that recapitulates the phenotype, expression in the proximal tubule of the kidney, and its function as a high-affinity glutamate and aspartate transporter.\nIn summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. The small number of probands and publications currently available limits the characterization of this disorder. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. It was reevaluated on 10/14/2022 with no new evidence found. As a result of this reevaluation, the classification remained Limited.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/70e4ba69-460a-4d46-adac-c8ba04a3d67b","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fd6cc720-f37b-4abf-a887-8701ac805343","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","changes":[{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"},{"id":"cg:sopChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fd6cc720-f37b-4abf-a887-8701ac805343_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10011","date":"2022-12-12T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fd6cc720-f37b-4abf-a887-8701ac805343_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10011","date":"2022-12-16T15:48:06.681Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fd6cc720-f37b-4abf-a887-8701ac805343_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fd6cc720-f37b-4abf-a887-8701ac805343_seg_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bcf878e4-c942-443b-aa61-fd56a0d80f22_proband_segregation","type":"FamilyCosegregation","dc:description":"Not enough affected individuals","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21123949","rdfs:label":"1","estimatedLodScore":0.98,"family":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bcf878e4-c942-443b-aa61-fd56a0d80f22","type":"Family","rdfs:label":"1","member":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bf54fb18-f8e2-423c-a073-2109af1ad58d","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21123949","rdfs:label":"1-II-1","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":44,"allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cffb64bf-0445-4634-bc8a-e6088ad202aa","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_004170.6(SLC1A1):c.1333C>T (p.Arg445Trp)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/155859"}},"detectionMethod":"DNA was isolated from saliva or peripheral blood mononuclear cells.
