There has only been one NS case where LAH was assessed but not noted, and this individual had sparse and curly hair. Therefore, the NS/LAH phenotype cannot be ruled out for any of these patients. The p.Ser2Gly variant has been a recurrently identified variant in cases with NS/LAH, and no other variants have been identified in these patients (Cordeddu et al., 2009; Ekvall et al., 2011; Komatsuzaki et al., 2010). In summary, this association is Disputed. Of note, SHOC2 is classified as Definitive in association with NS-like disorder with loose anagen hair and as Disputed in association with Costello syndrome and cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome. The ClinGen RASopathy Expert Panel found no evidence associating SHOC2 with NS with multiple lentigines. This curation was approved by the ClinGen RASopathy Gene Curation Expert Panel on 5/31/18 (SOP Version 5).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/94e2aec5-91e4-410b-a3a6-4ba9598f20a6","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/185c93c8-e875-46a2-83af-a8575b19a228","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"NoKnownDiseaseRelationship","changes":{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/185c93c8-e875-46a2-83af-a8575b19a228_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10021","date":"2018-05-31T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/185c93c8-e875-46a2-83af-a8575b19a228_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10021","date":"2021-03-10T14:29:29.193Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"All the cases described as NS so far have the p.S2G variant and LAH or have not had LAH ruled out, therefore it is not convincing that these cases are different from others.","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/185c93c8-e875-46a2-83af-a8575b19a228_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/185c93c8-e875-46a2-83af-a8575b19a228_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/185c93c8-e875-46a2-83af-a8575b19a228_ad_other_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ac558259-d5a9-4a78-807f-1f7ac3c4ae0f_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"This individual was the only individual not to have LAH described, but they were noted to have curly, sparse hair.
