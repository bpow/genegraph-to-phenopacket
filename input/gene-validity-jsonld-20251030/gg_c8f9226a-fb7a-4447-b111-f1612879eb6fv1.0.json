The *MTRFR* gene (previously known as *C12ORF65*) encodes an important mitochondrial translation release factor that functions in releasing newly synthesized peptides from the mitochondrial ribosome.\n\n*MTRFR* was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive mitochondrial disease in 2010 (PMID: 20598281). While various names have been given to the constellation of features seen in those with *MTRFR*-related disorders, including combined oxidative phosphorylation deficiency, spastic paraplegia, and Charcot Marie Tooth disease, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the MTRFR phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework. Of note, *MTRFR* was first curated by this Expert Panel for its association with Leigh syndrome spectrum (LSS) on December 9, 2019 (SOP V7), with a final classification of Definitive. This current curation for the association with primary mitochondrial disease includes the six cases included in the LSS curation.\n\nEvidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included five variants (all frameshift or termination) in eight probands from seven publications (PMIDs: 20598281, 24284555, 25995486, 24198383, 26380172, 23188110, 27858754). Clinical features in affected individuals include LSS, psychomotor regression, intellectual disability, muscle atrophy, myopathy, ataxia, spastic paraplegia, hypotonia, dysarthria, axonal polyneuropathy, optic atrophy, ophthalmoplegia, ptosis, nystagmus, strabismus, respiratory insufficiency, swallowing difficulty, and failure to thrive. Age of onset varies from childhood to adulthood. Outcomes are also quite variable as there have been reports of death in childhood as well as affected individuals living well into adulthood with a very slowly progressive disease course. Muscle biopsies show decreased activities of complexes I, II + III, and IV and COX negative fibers. Elevated lactate, decreased activities of complexes I, IV, and V in fibroblasts and decreased synthesis of mitochondrial proteins in patient fibroblasts has also been reported.\n\nThe mechanism of disease is loss of function. This gene-disease association is also supported by the known biochemical function of MTRFR in mitochondrial translation, functional alteration in patient and non-patient cells, and rescue in patient cells (PMIDs: 20598281, 27858754, 26380172, 22821833).\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between *MTRFR* and primary mitochondrial disease. This relationship has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on May 23, 2024 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c8f9226a-fb7a-4447-b111-f1612879eb6f","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/27e53978-d972-44e0-8605-0b2c9e35eb51","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/27e53978-d972-44e0-8605-0b2c9e35eb51_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2025-02-27T19:29:18.636Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/27e53978-d972-44e0-8605-0b2c9e35eb51_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2024-05-23T04:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/27e53978-d972-44e0-8605-0b2c9e35eb51_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/08412b47-a999-4a75-ac98-a487de9b1403_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/88c2f9ce-fdea-44b0-b5ab-6f0ae131d2d8","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"COX/CS was 40% of controls.

This reduction in mt-protein synthesis is not a consequence of a reduction in mt-RNA levels, which are modestly elevated (Fig. 4B), again as seen in other C12orf65 patients. When cells are artificially depleted of C12orf65 protein using siRNA, the elevation in mt-RNA levels is more striking (Fig. 4C). A mitoribosome defect is unlikely to be responsible in this patient, as no global differences were observed in the steady state levels of mitoribosomal protein levels (Fig. 4D). To identify if the synthesised polypeptides are stable, steady state levels of RC proteins were assessed by western blotting following SDS-PAGE. This confirmed decreased levels of complex IV (COX2 expression), consistent with our biochemical assays but also revealed reduced levels of CI and modest changes in CIII subunits (Fig. 4E). To determine if synthesised polypeptides were incorporated into fully assembled oxidative phosphorylation complexes, western blots of mitochondrial fractions separated by 1D BN-PAGE were performed. A reduction in the amount of fully assembled complexes I, IV and V was observed in the patient compared to controls, together with a minor complex III defect, visible in the I+III supercomplex (Fig. 4F). These data are consistent with C12orf65 playing a ubiquitous role in mt-translation but with a more severe effect on CIV activity.
