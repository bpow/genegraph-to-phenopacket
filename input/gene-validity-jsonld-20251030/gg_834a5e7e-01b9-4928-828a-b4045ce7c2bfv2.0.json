{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/834a5e7e-01b9-4928-828a-b4045ce7c2bfv2.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"Variants in the *GLIS2* gene have been observed in individuals with nephronophthisis, an autosomal recessive inherited disease presenting in childhood with polyuria, polydipsia, progressive chronic kidney disease, a bland urinary sediment, and progression to kidney failure before the age of 30. Affected children may have growth restriction. Their kidneys are small or normal-sized and hyperechoic with corticomedullary cysts and tubular basement membrane abnormalities. \n\n*GLIS2* was first reported in association with  nephronophthisis in 2007 (Attanasio M et al., 2007 PMID 17618285). At least 3 unique variants, c.775+1G>T ; p.Cys175Arg, and (NM_032,575.3: c.560_574del, p.H188_Y192del) have been reported in humans (Attanasio M et al., 2007 PMID 17618285; Halbritter et al., 2013 PMID 23559409; Al Alawi et al. 2021 PMID 34917135). The disease mechanism is reported to be a loss of function. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found there is only one molecular mechanism underlying nephronophthisis 7 (MIM: 611498). Evidence supporting this *GLIS2*-nephronophthisis 7 relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. \n\nGenetic evidence on case-level data contributes 4.2 points. Variants in *GLIS2* have been reported in at least 3 probands in 3 publications (Attanasio M et al., 2007 PMID 17618285; Halbritter et al., 2013 PMID 23559409; Al Alawi et al. 2021 PMID 34917135). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 2 additional family members in one of these publications (Attanasio M et al., 2007 PMID 17618285). This gene-disease relationship has not been studied in any case-control studies at the single or aggregate variant level. \n\nThis gene-disease association is supported by experimental evidence. Zhang et al. cloned *Glis2* from mouse kidney RNA (Zhang et al., 2002 PMID 11741991), and the deduced 521-amino acid protein has a calculated molecular mass of 55.8 kD. Northern blot analysis and RT-PCR detected highest expression in the kidney. Immunohistochemical staining in a mouse model has revealed GLIS2 expression throughout all renal tubule segments and epithelial cells of Bowman’s capsule (Attanasio M et al.,  2007 PMID 17618285; Halbritter et al., 2013 PMID 23559409). Zhang et al. concluded that *Glis2* behaves as a bifunctional transcriptional regulator (Zhang et al., 2002 PMID 11741991). In a zebrafish model, knockdown of the zebrafish isoform *nphp7.2* resulted in cyst formation, which was rescued by zebrafish *nphp7.2* mRNA. However, forced nuclear import did not rescue the transcriptional defects of *GLIS2* p.Cys175Arg, indicating additional defects of the DNA-binding protein (Ramachandran H et al. 2016, PMID 26374130). Thus, the score for experimental evidence for a gene-disease association was 5.5 points. \n\nIn summary, there is Moderate evidence to support this *GLIS2*-nephronophthisis relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Kidney Cystic and Ciliopathy Disorders GCEP on the meeting date 05/22/2024 (SOP Version 10).\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/834a5e7e-01b9-4928-828a-b4045ce7c2bf","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c51be76f-59d3-4884-9df3-4416686848ab","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","changes":[{"id":"cg:newEvidence"},{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"},{"id":"cg:sopChange"},{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},{"id":"cg:classificationChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c51be76f-59d3-4884-9df3-4416686848ab_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10066","date":"2024-06-27T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c51be76f-59d3-4884-9df3-4416686848ab_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10066","date":"2024-07-18T17:35:12.581Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["RecurationTiming"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c51be76f-59d3-4884-9df3-4416686848ab_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/78ed5ada-60ac-4303-9eef-f9038562847a_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/78ed5ada-60ac-4303-9eef-f9038562847a","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17618285","rdfs:label":"II2","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":8,"allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3e0650b4-158c-4d76-9c5d-21466d3b5ce0","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"GLIS2,
