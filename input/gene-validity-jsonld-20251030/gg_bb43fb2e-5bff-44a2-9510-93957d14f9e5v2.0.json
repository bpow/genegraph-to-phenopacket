At least 8 unique variants (e.g. missense, in-frame indel, frameshift, large deletion) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level and experimental data. Summary of Case Level Data: 3.5 POINTS. Variants in this gene have been curated from 5 probands in 3 publications ( PMID: 24268659, 28939701, 28749478). The mechanism for the disease is homozygous loss of function (PMID: 24268659). This gene-disease association is supported by a mouse model (PMID: 28826497) which recapitulates disease as well as a zebrafish myopathy model which was rescued by expression of human *KLHL41* (PMID: 24268659). Additionally, the function of KLHL41 in regulation of the thin filaments (PMIDs: 28826497, 30986853) its expression in skeletal muscle (PMID: 28826497), and its interaction with components of the sarcomere (PMID: 28826497), all provide further evidence. In summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged.\n\nThis gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the CM GCEP on 11/5/2019. It was reevaluated on 10/21/2024. As a result of this reevaluation no new evidence was identified and the classification remained at Moderate (SOP Version 11).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bb43fb2e-5bff-44a2-9510-93957d14f9e5","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b6bd51c2-e7b8-4938-a700-fd0e393143a7","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","changes":[{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},{"id":"cg:sopChange"},{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b6bd51c2-e7b8-4938-a700-fd0e393143a7_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10031","date":"2024-11-25T15:13:54.955Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b6bd51c2-e7b8-4938-a700-fd0e393143a7_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10031","date":"2024-10-28T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["RecurationNewEvidence","RecurationTiming"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b6bd51c2-e7b8-4938-a700-fd0e393143a7_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d275f9f9-c0ad-43d7-8082-04101c014396_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d275f9f9-c0ad-43d7-8082-04101c014396","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24268659","rdfs:label":"12DG1177-1","ageType":"AgeAtDeath","ageUnit":"Days","ageValue":1,"allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/59383a61-19a1-4170-b807-a39dee7caab9","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_006063.3(KLHL41):c.641del
