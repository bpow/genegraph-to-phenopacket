{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0fef8377-bc87-4eb3-826a-038f1520bdf2v1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"FANCD2 is one of the more than twenty Fanconi anemia (FA) or FA-like genes known to cause autosomal recessive Fanconi anemia characterized by bone marrow failure, developmental abnormalities, cellular hypersensitivity to DNA cross-linking agents such as mitomycin C and diepoxybutane, and cancer predisposition. Biallelic predicted and/or proven loss-of-function variants in FANCD2 were first identified in Fanconi anemia patients in 2001 (PMID: 11239453). Since then, more than 20 variants in FANCD2 have been reported in individuals with FA complementation group D2 (PMIDs: 17436244, 25703294, 23613520). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) for the variant type has been reached. Although most of the reported variants have a predicted and/or proven loss-of-function effect, the presence of residual FANCD2 protein has been documented in the individuals and cell models, regardless of the ‘reverse mosaicism’ phenomenon where hematopoietic cells may regain the wild-type allele via mechanisms such as reversing the mutation or recombination with gene conversion. This gene-disease relationship is further supported by functional studies  demonstrating the protein-protein interactions with other FA genes, functional alteration in the patient fibroblast cells carrying biallelic FANCD2 variants, and rescue of the function in the patient cell culture models (PMID: 11239454). Animal studies demonstrated the recapitulation of the biochemical and morphological phenotypes reported in humans (PMIDs: 12893777, 14667412). In summary, FANCD2 is definitively associated with FA complementation group D2. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in the research and clinical diagnostic settings and upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0fef8377-bc87-4eb3-826a-038f1520bdf2","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5f0c260f-52d2-4225-9044-608f066ccfb2","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5f0c260f-52d2-4225-9044-608f066ccfb2_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10023","date":"2021-06-15T23:15:22.650Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5f0c260f-52d2-4225-9044-608f066ccfb2_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10023","date":"2021-06-15T23:15:06.767Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5f0c260f-52d2-4225-9044-608f066ccfb2_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d313ac4a-33b0-41d9-923b-ad8c98b8590f_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"the affected sibling also has the same set of the variants.

The activated FANCD2 accumalated in nuclear foci in response to DNA-damaging agents. FANCD2 mutations cause the loss of monoubiquitinated isoform. The FANCA, FANCC, and FANCG cell lines were also shown to be lacking the monoubiquitinated isoform which was corrected upon the complementation of the cell lines with corresponding FA cDNAs.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11239454","rdfs:label":"Immunoblotting & Monoubiquitination","demonstrates":{"id":"obo:MI_0208"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":5}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":2949,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria8","strengthScore":17,"subject":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/dq_NF1evmkk","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0009214","gene":"hgnc:3585","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","websiteLegacyID":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/assertion_5f0c260f-52d2-4225-9044-608f066ccfb2-","@context":{"@vocab":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"},"curationReasons":{"@type":"@vocab","@container":"@set"},"GCISnapshot":{"@type":"@id"},"dc:isVersionOf":{"@type":"@id"},"websiteLegacyID":{"@type":"@id"}}}
