Only one missense variant that was reported as a de novo occurrence in an individual with congenital heart disease was included in this curation (PMID: 32368696). There were several other probands reported with variants in *MED13L*, however they were not scored due to high minor allele frequency in gnomAD v4 (MAF> 0.00001, PMIDs: 14638541, 27959697, 33448881, 35885997, 36307859, 35910219). This gene-disease relationship is also supported by an expression study (PMID: 14638541).  In summary, there is limited evidence supporting the relationship between *MED13L* and autosomal dominant congenital heart disease. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Congenital Heart Disease GCEP on the meeting date 2/12/2024 (SOP Version 10).\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/99da731b-f049-43f2-a02e-1e0562e9b9c0","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9479ebdd-98ef-48d1-8026-03360c19c23f","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","changes":{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9479ebdd-98ef-48d1-8026-03360c19c23f_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10130","date":"2024-02-12T19:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9479ebdd-98ef-48d1-8026-03360c19c23f_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10130","date":"2024-05-15T13:14:42.702Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration","ErrorClarification"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9479ebdd-98ef-48d1-8026-03360c19c23f_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1fbb402a-b0a3-4278-aab6-735398ac9989","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1fbb402a-b0a3-4278-aab6-735398ac9989_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32368696","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b79dea74-97d1-46b7-a7a3-ad84575c50e0","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_015335.5(MED13L):c.6392C>T (p.Ser2131Leu)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA386873942"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:DeNovoAlleleOrigin"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:Heterozygous"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9479ebdd-98ef-48d1-8026-03360c19c23f_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9479ebdd-98ef-48d1-8026-03360c19c23f_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/59fb8c52-d2da-4373-98ea-3f75987f570f","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ab32774a-af6a-4a98-9624-27813dfbb14e","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Northern blot analysis on human multiple tissues shows that PROSIT240 is expressed in multiple tissues, with high expression in the brain, heart, skeletal muscle, kidney, placenta, and peripheral blood leukocytes.
