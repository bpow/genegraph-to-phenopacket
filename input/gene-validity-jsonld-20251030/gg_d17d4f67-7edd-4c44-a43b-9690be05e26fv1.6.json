The latter may be related to an olfactory deficiency observed in Nlgn3 mutants. Nlgn3 KO mice also exhibited increased locomotor activity, but had no clear deficits in learning and memory. The total brain volume of Nlgn3-deficient mice was slightly reduced, as determined by magnetic resonance imaging.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19243448","rdfs:label":"Nlgn3 KO mice - behavior","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":5.25}],"evidenceStrength":"Moderate","sequence":12103,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria11","strengthScore":9.85,"subject":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/XzU5WNiRTOg","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0100148","gene":"hgnc:14289","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0001417"},"version":"1.6","websiteLegacyID":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/assertion_b6e7e531-093b-4216-8c56-0c94e63c2811-","@context":{"@vocab":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"},"curationReasons":{"@type":"@vocab","@container":"@set"},"GCISnapshot":{"@type":"@id"},"dc:isVersionOf":{"@type":"@id"},"websiteLegacyID":{"@type":"@id"}}}
