This association was made using case-level and experimental data. At least 25 pathogenic variants in this gene are reported in ClinVar, including nonsense, frameshift, missense and splicing variants. F13A1 encodes A subunits, which have catalytic function, of the coagulation factor XIII. FXIII is a transglutaminase that forms intramolecular gamma-glutamyl-epsilon-lysine crosslinking between fibrin molecules to stabilize blood clots. Factor XIIIA deficiency is characterized by a bleeding diathesis, poor wound healing and reduced Factor XIII activity levels. Mutations in F13A1 were first associated with this disease in humans as early as 1992 by Board et al. (PMID: 8324218) and Kamura et al (PMID: 1644910).\n\nSummary of Case Level Data (12 points): The association is seen in at least 10 probands in 7 publications (PMID: 9531593, 1353995, 12100162, 1644910, 7727776, 8025280, 19438481). More case-level evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts) has been reached.\n\nThe mechanism for disease is expected to be biallelic loss of function.  \n\nSummary of Experimental Data (4.5 points): Mouse models recapitulating FXIII deficiency and rescue using rFXIII have been reported (PMID: 12529747, 18224415).  \n\nIn summary, the F13A1 - Factor XIIIA deficiency gene-disease relationship is definitive. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hemostasis/Thrombosis GCEP on July 22, 2020.

The variant gave rise to two abnormal transcripts that used an alternative AG, 7 bases downstream in exon 6. The first transcript lacks the first 7 bases of exon 6, causing a frameshift and premature termination within exon 6. The second transcript lacks all of exon 5, in addition to the first 7 bases of exon 6, producing a polypeptide with an in-frame deletion within the core domain of FXIIIA. The variant was also observed in the heterozygous state in the eldest unaffected sibling and unaffected father of the proband.\n\nThe missense variant, Arg704Trp, was analyzed by computer molecular modeling, which suggests replacement of Arg by Trp at this location might result in a potential unstable FXIIIA molecule.\n\nThis variant was expected to be inherited maternally, but on analysis was found to be absent in the mother. Maternity and paternity were confirmed for the proband and his two siblings by examining nine unique highly polymorphic microsatellite repeats and chromosome 6 haplotype analysis. However, the authors note that this missense variant could be a single mutational event in a maternal germ cell or that there was maternal germline mosaicism.\n\nThe proband is scored default points for the null variant and the de novo missense with confirmed maternity and paternity.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/028196f3-af08-4448-b70c-578b61a29aff","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19438481","rdfs:label":"Anwar_Proband_II:3","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":13,"detectionMethod":"All 15 exons of F13A1 were amplified by PCR and sequenced","ethnicity":{"id":"cg:NotHispanicOrLatino"},"firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypeFreeText":"Diagnosed with factor XIII deficiency at 8 months, umbilical bleeding shortly after birth","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0040233","obo:HP_0011884"],"previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"Complete lack of plasma FXIIIA and reduced levels of plasma FXIIIB (0·56 iu/ml)","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/714e3d07-62c5-4730-a7be-d9bb16058b60_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19438481","allele":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5cbd8948-d677-407a-bdf7-fb1cdf51b172","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000129.3(F13A1):c.2110C>T (p.Arg704Trp)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/16538"}},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ed07eb17-5087-4bfb-82d2-e8c5454dc4a7","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"F13A1, IVS5AS, G-A, -1","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/16537"}}],"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:DeNovoAlleleOrigin"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bb0af838-df39-4db4-a4a9-1c2cfaa9fa09_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The proband was found to be homozygous for the missense variant, Arg682His.
