Numerous variants have been reported in humans per ClinVar. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Summary of case-level and experimental data: 16.5 points. Variants (nonsense, missense, and frameshift) in this gene have been reported in at least 7 probands in 4 publications (PMIDS: 14630978, 21392394, 9452066, 1546315). The mechanism for disease is expected to be homozygoues loss of function. This gene-disease association is supported by expression studies, animal models, and in vitro functional assays. In summary, PEX2 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive peroxisomal biogenesis disorder. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5e9426d4-7bd8-4281-9d4b-c17c139da871","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/17bf1c4a-1775-40c6-a499-774c93827343","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/17bf1c4a-1775-40c6-a499-774c93827343_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10049","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/17bf1c4a-1775-40c6-a499-774c93827343_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10049","date":"2020-02-07T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/17bf1c4a-1775-40c6-a499-774c93827343_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/17bf1c4a-1775-40c6-a499-774c93827343_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5b58f74d-0e2c-4860-b3d2-aca4d3a0280d","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fd154545-7d83-44e3-a845-c4ac8a4b708b","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Model of 2 drosophila Pex2 variants: pex2f01899 (heterozygous, in trans) and pex2HP35039 (homozygous)\n\nboth variants result in male sterility due to spermatogenesis impairment (Fig. 1 C) and impair spermatocyte cytokinesis (Fig. 2), impaired peroxisomal matrix protein import, determined by GFP-SKlL transgene and PEX2-mCherry transgene and performing colocalization (Fig. 5E-G)","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19933170","rdfs:label":"Drosophila model","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c4fcc236-3a04-4a33-8d7c-1e8357c0ef0a","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/eeb6d7ba-561d-48ac-b067-11d25dc80943","type":"Finding","dc:description":"In vivo labeling with DrdU showed neuronal migration delay in null mice based on disordered lamination in cerebral cortex and increased cell density in white matter (Fig. 1)\n\nNull mice have reduced size of the cerebellum and altered folial pattern in the vermis (Fig. 2) when the cerebellum was stained with cal-bindin-D28k antibody, it was shown that null mice have abnormalities of Purkinje cells dendritic arborization (Fig. 3)\n\nWhen PEX2 null mice were inbred (129 background) embryonic lethality and neuronal lipidosis was observed (Fig. 4)\n\nNull mice exhibit accumulation of VLCFA and deficient plasmalogen synthesis (Fig. 5-7)","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11478384","rdfs:label":"Targeted PEX2 deletion - Mouse Model","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/17bf1c4a-1775-40c6-a499-774c93827343_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fa0bc806-8d2e-4e78-a4a2-26f0aecc2bf7","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8c53766b-a2d5-44fb-bcb2-ea96ec5707b4","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Used bimolecular fluorescence complementation to show PEX2 to be in complex with PEX10 to form a portion of the RING finger complex","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22500805","rdfs:label":"PEX10 Interaction","demonstrates":{"id":"obo:MI_0915"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/761f8bb7-f706-4569-901e-fbcae5568316","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/600356df-f81f-4c31-ac58-4372e7f0ce32","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Use of immunoprecipitation, E.
