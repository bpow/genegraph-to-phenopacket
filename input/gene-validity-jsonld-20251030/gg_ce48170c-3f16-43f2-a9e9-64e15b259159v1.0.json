Molybdenum cofactor deficiency type B is characterized by refractory neonatal seizures, dysmorphic features, ocular lens dislocation, and a characteristic urinary profile indicative of an underlying biochemical dysfunction (PMID:33017596). The underlying mechanism is a failure to synthesize molybdenum cofactor, leading to loss of function of the enzymes sulfite oxidase, xanthine oxidase, and aldehyde oxidase (PMID:33017596).\n\nEight variants (two missense, one nonsense, three frameshift, one splice-acceptor site, one start-loss) that have been reported in seven probands in three publications (PMID: 10053004, 25709896, 16021469) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached.\n\nThe mechanism of pathogenicity is known to be biallelic loss-of-function. The *MOCS2* gene encodes both the large and small subunits of the homotetrameric molybdopterin synthase enzyme. Biallelic loss of function of either subunit is sufficient to cause disease. \n\nThis gene-disease association is also supported by expression studies, in vitro functional assays, and an animal model (PMID: 27138983, 33017596). Expression of this gene is enriched in the liver, kidney, and brain. Homozygous knock-out of the homologous gene in mice leads to the combined loss of sulfite oxidase, xanthine oxidase, and aldehyde oxidase activities. Further, these mice fail to thrive and have a significantly reduced lifespan.\n\nIn summary, *MOCS2* is definitively associated with autosomal recessive molybdenum cofactor deficiency type B. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time without the emergence of contradictory evidence. This classification was approved by the ClinGen General Inborn Errors of Metabolism GCEP on 12/9/2022 (SOP Version 9).\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ce48170c-3f16-43f2-a9e9-64e15b259159","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cd8d7002-1f0a-4fa7-9311-9d63b31b0125","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cd8d7002-1f0a-4fa7-9311-9d63b31b0125_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10097","date":"2022-12-16T17:07:03.664Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cd8d7002-1f0a-4fa7-9311-9d63b31b0125_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10097","date":"2022-12-09T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cd8d7002-1f0a-4fa7-9311-9d63b31b0125_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cd8d7002-1f0a-4fa7-9311-9d63b31b0125_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f5d70e78-b694-4b26-89b5-b8ec34d135be","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7b3d93ea-d765-48e3-89f9-4cc68daa4677","type":"Finding","dc:description":"MoCo deficiency type B is characterized by loss of MoCo containing enzymes, which manifests as sulfite oxidase deficiency in patient tissues, reduced uric acid in both the serum and urine, and increased sulfites in the urine.
