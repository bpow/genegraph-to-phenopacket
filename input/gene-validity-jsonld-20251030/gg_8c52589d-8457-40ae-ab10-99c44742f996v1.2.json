Kptn KO mice exhibit skull shape abnormalities (overgrowth, deformation) and increased total brain area which align with the macrocephaly and frontal bossing phenotypes observed in individuals with KPTN-related disorder. Brain overgrowth in this mice results from hypercellularity rather than an increase in cell body size, in contrast to what has been observed in some models of mTOR-related macrocephaly. Kptn−/− mice also have increased locomotor activity and anxiety-like phenotypes, and defects in social recognition memory. In a spatial memory assay, the Barnes maze, KO mice had normal behavior during the training phase and during the first probe test, after 24 h. However, during the second probe test, after 72 h, KO mice showed a modest decrease in memory retention. In a pairwise discrimination task (visual operant conditioning task) KO mice performed like wild-type animals. Western blot on brain tissue from KO and WT mice assessing the phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 (RPS6), a known downstream target of the mTORC1 pathway, revealed a significant increase in mTOR pathway activity in Kptn−/− mice. The excess p-RPS6 signal is corrected by treatment with rapamycin, a known mTOR inhibitor.\n","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37437211","rdfs:label":"Kptn-/- mice","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7047f1c0-edd6-4807-88d4-94f698481a40_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/314237d3-ae7a-4775-9766-5be2c8f2170b_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/314237d3-ae7a-4775-9766-5be2c8f2170b","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25847626","rdfs:label":"Pajusalu Brother","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":32,"allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/edfde66c-6aa6-4bbc-bcdc-2ea77948c033","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_007059.4(KPTN):c.665dup (p.Ser223GlufsTer?)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA633432667"}},"detectionMethod":"Chromosomal microarray analysis was performed on both siblings.
