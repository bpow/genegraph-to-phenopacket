Variable expressivity, age of ascertainment, and outdated clinical assessments of affected individuals may complicate the clinical diagnosis of NS versus other MAP2K1-RASopathies. The MAP2K1 gene is also located in the Ras/MAPK pathway, which is associated with the NS phenotype (Aoki et al., 2016; Rauen, 2013). However, additional phenotype-genotype correlations are necessary to solidify the association of MAP2K1 with NS. Of note, MAP2K1 is classified as Definitive in association with cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome, as Limited in association with NS with multiple lentigines, and as Disputed in association with Costello syndrome. The ClinGen RASopathy Expert Panel found no evidence associating MAP2K1 with NS-like disorder with loose anagen hair. This curation was approved by the ClinGen RASopathy Gene Curation Expert Panel on 7/24/18 (SOP Version 5).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1f1b57a9-2d0f-4710-92fe-ceabbb3070fd","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1eafd4b1-29b1-4a17-a7ac-2c555f2e2648","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","changes":{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1eafd4b1-29b1-4a17-a7ac-2c555f2e2648_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10021","date":"2018-07-24T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1eafd4b1-29b1-4a17-a7ac-2c555f2e2648_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10021","date":"2021-03-10T15:33:34.318Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1eafd4b1-29b1-4a17-a7ac-2c555f2e2648_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1eafd4b1-29b1-4a17-a7ac-2c555f2e2648_ad_other_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/caf80835-9167-45cb-8c52-1041cdfbc62f_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"lack of phenotype in mother with variant","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cf99ef0b-e2ba-4ae7-873c-280fc194669d","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17704260","rdfs:label":"Nava1","detectionMethod":"This study screened 70 NS patients without PTPN11 variants for variants in KRAS, BRAF, MEK1 and MEK2 using dye terminator sequencing.
