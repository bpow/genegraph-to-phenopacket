Cases of *TPM3*-related myopathy have historically been categorized by histological features in muscle biopsy and include nemaline myopathy, cap myopathy, and myopathy with fiber-type disproportion on a spectrum of severity. Several unique loss-of-function null variants (e.g. nonsense, splice-site, frameshift) have been reported in humans, in an autosomal recessive manner. Case-level genetic evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship (11 points) includes published reports of at least six probands observed to have loss of function variants and parents who are asymptomatic heterozygous carriers (PMIDs: 10619715, 12196661, 18382475, 19953533, 37393515). Additionally, these probands display various phenotypes, with the majority showing hypotonia, poor head control, inability to walk, scoliosis, Type 1 muscle fiber atrophy/hypotrophy, delayed motor milestones, muscle weakness, and nemaline bodies. This gene-disease association is additionally supported by TPM3's biochemical function, unique expression in the skeletal muscle tissue, physical protein interaction with ACTA1 (PMID: 22749829), and altered function of TPM3 mutant proteins dramatically changing myofilament function (PMID: 21357678). Experimental-level genetic evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship scored 3 points. In summary, there is definitive evidence (14 points) to support the relationship between *TPM3* and autosomal recessive *TPM3*-related myopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Congenital Myopathies Gene Curation Expert Panel on the meeting date April 8, 2024 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/15a47a70-5c18-479f-840f-bae276db324b","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4638d255-c615-4d17-acf0-2943bc022f56","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4638d255-c615-4d17-acf0-2943bc022f56_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10031","date":"2024-06-24T20:00:24.621Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4638d255-c615-4d17-acf0-2943bc022f56_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10031","date":"2024-04-08T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4638d255-c615-4d17-acf0-2943bc022f56_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4638d255-c615-4d17-acf0-2943bc022f56_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f8139109-761b-428f-8c62-897b1795d5c4","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ab7b7d60-0e21-4cf3-b764-c4d1f977669d","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Dramatic changes in myofilament function","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21357678","rdfs:label":"Ottenheijm muscle fiber mechanics"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e63daa4b-a390-4956-8aaa-0071b6c825fa","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Many different assays in E. coli and expressed variants support the pathogenicity of TPM3, specifically the reduced actin binding affinity, the calcium sensitivity increase/decrease depending on the specific mutation, and the reduced filament gliding velocity when appraising the mutant vs WT filaments.

Firstly, co-sedimentation confirmed that most of the mutations in TPM3 resulted in a significantly reduced binding affinity for actin compared to controls (Table 2). The mutants also all inhibit activation, and in some cases inhibition, of actin-activated myosin S1 ATPase activity. Depending on the mutation, calcium sensitivity either significantly increases or decreases compared to the wild-type yielding a hypercontractile or hypocontractile phenotype. Finally, the mutant actin filament gliding on thin filaments reduced the filament gliding velocity compared to wildtype to varying degrees depending on mutation and predicted severity. All of these are crucial functions for TPM3 that are disrupted by these expressed mutations by some degree and all are predicted to yield the phenotypes of TPM3-related congenital myopathies including muscle weakness, fiber-type disproportion, disorganized sarcomeres, and nemaline rods/cap structures.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22749829","rdfs:label":"TPM3 Mutants Alter Function"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4638d255-c615-4d17-acf0-2943bc022f56_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d85d20c2-00a4-4e86-a05f-7be5065e5ac7","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"This evidence earns default points in consideration of TPM3's role in skeletal muscle thin filaments matching with the muscular phenotypes observed in TPM3-related myopathy.","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c8e577f3-16e1-4488-a018-5e0f55c1b273","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Since TPM3 is one of the central proteins that makes up the skeletal muscle thin filaments, it follows that a mutation that disrupts the function of the protein would cause a myriad of muscle-related phenotypes.

Proband also harbor variants in other genes: RYR1, YXB3, SRPK3, DNDPEP, and TNNT3. \n\n","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Male","variant":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cb459bbf-01d2-4089-9690-b819010f1052_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b3f549d1-8e44-43d6-a9bb-b0f98df3b740_variant_evidence_item"}]}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria","strengthScore":1.0},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4f5dc188-eeac-4009-8ea6-31f82a8a1b17_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d29af1f6-e886-4d71-ab00-f5128d038f23","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Reduced score due to variant previously used and proband's family has distant consanguinity three generations removed.","calculatedScore":4,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d29af1f6-e886-4d71-ab00-f5128d038f23_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"PMID: 21357678","functionalDataSupport":"Yes"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d29af1f6-e886-4d71-ab00-f5128d038f23_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19953533","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/411638ec-9c97-4681-87f4-67bcae6b8530"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4f5dc188-eeac-4009-8ea6-31f82a8a1b17","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19953533","rdfs:label":"Lawlor Proband 313-1","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/411638ec-9c97-4681-87f4-67bcae6b8530"},"detectionMethod":"Genomic PCR and DNA sequencing was used to screen the TPM3 gene and the TPM1 gene.
