Raymond et al. reported one frameshift, one splice site, and two missense variants in highly conserved residues of the gene. At least seven unique variants have been reported in humans, and X linked syndromic ID is characterized by mildly to severely impaired intellectual development including difficulties with speech and language . Individuals showed variable clinical features such as marfanoid habitus, facial dysmorphism, and hypotonia. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data. \n\nCase level data: \nZDHHC9 variants have been reported in at least seven probands in six publications (PMIDs: 17436253, 19377476, 24357419, 29681091, 28687527, 20848651). Publications reported putative LOF (i.e. duplications, deletions, nonsense) variants and some missense variants. Additionally, variants segregated with syndromic X-linked ID in 11 additional family members. \n\nExperimental data:\nThe relationship between ZDHHC9 and syndromic X-linked ID is supported by animal models and in vitro functional assays. Kouskou et al. 2018 (PMID: 29944857) showed that Zdhhc9 knockout mice exhibit altered behavior that is consistent with reduced anxiety levels. Knockout mice also scored lower on the Morris water maze test indicating deficits in hippocampal-dependent spatial learning and memory. MRI analyses revealed a 36% reduction in corpus callosum volume. Shimell et al. 2019 (PMID: 31747610) investigated Zdhcc9 function in hippocampal cultures. Loss of Zdhhc9 function resulted in shorter dendritic arbors and fewer inhibitory synapses, suggesting an important role for Zdhhc9 in neuronal development.\n\nIn summary, ZDHCC9 is definitively associated wtih syndromic X-linked intellectual disability, and there is an abundance of evidence to support this association.\n\nThis classification was approved by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism GCEP on 05/19/2020 (SOP version 7).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/573a2983-4b49-4d67-b164-a572e0711c3d","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2156b925-1ee6-4edb-a514-3650aa5b780e","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"},"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2156b925-1ee6-4edb-a514-3650aa5b780e_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2021-10-14T14:47:29.126Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2156b925-1ee6-4edb-a514-3650aa5b780e_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2020-05-19T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2156b925-1ee6-4edb-a514-3650aa5b780e_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2156b925-1ee6-4edb-a514-3650aa5b780e_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2c8d8ce7-d6e8-438e-83fe-eaa7cd63bc33","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/891011cb-115a-45a0-ad22-fc78dad7a929","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Loss of Zdhhc9 function in hippocampal cultures leads to shorter dendritic arbors and fewer inhibitory synapses, altering the ratio of excitatory-to-inhibitory inputs formed onto Zdhhc9-deficient cells.
