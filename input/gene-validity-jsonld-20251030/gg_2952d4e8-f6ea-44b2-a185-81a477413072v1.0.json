This condition is characterized by central features of agenesis or thinning of corpus callosum, developmental delay/intellectual disability, comined immunodeficiency with signs of thymic aplasia/hypoplasia, cardiomyopathy, cataracts, and microcephaly. To date approximately 90 individuals have been reported with biallelic variants in *EPG5* (Dafsari, Gene reviews 2022). In this curation, 12 variants were scored including frameshift, missense, nonsense, and splice site variants across 7 probands from 4 publications (PMIDs:26395118, 23222957, 26917586, 344762) to reach a maximum score of genetic evidence. Heterozygous parents and siblings were unaffected. The mechanism of pathogenicity is loss of function. \n\nThis gene-disease association is also supported by the biochemical function of EPG5 (PMID:27588602).EPG5 is a protein involved in autophagy, which facilitates fusion specificity of autophagosomes with late endosomes and lysosomes. Patient fibroblasts have been shown to have impaired autophagy. Multi-system effects may be due to disrupted autophagy function, which plays a crucial role in cell homeostasis through the recycling/ degredation of protein products/organelles and the role of autophagy pathways in immune system defense. Additionally, the gene-disease relationship is supported by knock out *EPG5* (-/-) mice (PMID: 23674064). *EPG5* knockout mice recapitulated the phenotypes of pathologic corpus callosum changes and myopathy, including an increase in centrally located nuclei. However, knock out *EPG5* mice grew to be sexually active adults and failed to recapitulate phenotypes such as facial dysmorphia, hypopigmentation, immunodeficiency phenotypes cataracts, and cardiac changes. Finally, the gene-disease relationship is supported by knock out *EPG5* zebrafish (PMID: 30806141). *EPG5*  (-/-) zebrafish displayed phenotypes such as cardiomyopathy, growth impairment, and perhaps most notably, defective autophagy pathway and features of myopathy. In summary, there is definitive evidence to support this gene-disease relationship.
