There is strong evidence associating KCNE1 with acquired LQTS, however, only limited evidence for its association with unprovoked LQTS. Furthermore, several case reports have identified homozygous or compound heterozygous rare variants in KCNE1 in patients with Jervell-Lange-Nielsen Syndrome, however parents or siblings carrying only one allele have reported normal phenotypes suggesting an association of this gene with an autosomal-recessive form of LQTS (PMIDs 9354783, 9328483, 9445165).\nNote: All LQTS genes were curated by 3 separate blinded teams.
