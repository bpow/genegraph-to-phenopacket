Phenotypes associated include iris hypopigmentation, reduction in hair, skin, and eye pigment, abnormality of the optic nerve, nystagmus, photophobia, strabismus, and visual impairment (PMID:17980020). OCA is further broken down by type based on phenotypic differences. Oculocutaneous albinism type 2 is less severe than type 1 with skin and hair pigmentation ranging from minimal to near normal. Variants in OCA2 were first reported in relation to OCA2 in 1993 by Rinchik et al (PMID:8421497). Variants in OCA2 account for approximately 30% of worldwide cases of oculocutaneous albinism type 2 (at least 154 unique variants have been reported) (PMID:32963319). Evidence from 26 probands in 7 publications have been included in this curation, representing 31 unique variants (missense, nonsense, frameshift, and splice site) (PMIDs:115712365, 1906277, 33612058, 19865097, 28726809, 29345414, 33808351). Of note, the most common OCA2 variant among African individuals with oculocutaneous albinism, previously referred to in the literature as Brown oculocutaneous albinism [MIM:203200], is a 2.7 kb deletion; this variant is thought to account for ~20% of African cases (PMID:21085994). Please note that because the pigmentary phenotype due to pathogenic variants in OCA2 and other OCA genes can appear different in individuals of African descent. Per ClinGen Lumping and Splitting guidelines, the General Gene Curation Expert Panel has not identified a difference in phenotypes associated with both disease entities or types of variants associated with either presentation. Therefore, the GCEP has decided to lump this entity into this curation. The gene-disease relationship between oculocutaneous albinism type 2 and OCA2 is supported by evidence for protein interaction in melanocytes between the P protein encoded by OCA2 and both tyrosinase, and tyrosinase related protein 1 (encoded by two other genes, TYR and TYRP1, known to also be associated with oculocutaneous albinism) (PMID:19060277). Additionally, there are multiple animal models available to support this gene-disease relationship, including mice (PMIDs:1495987, 1509264, 8421497), German Spitz dogs (PMID:28973042), and Rhesus macaques (PMID:32259106). In summary there is definitive evidence supporting a gene-disease relationship between variants in OCA2 and oculocutaneous albinism type 2. This classification has been approved by the ClinGen General Gene Curation Expert Panel on 8/25/2021.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a7f3c287-9e76-42db-bc2d-58d16d8044c8","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7433c1e2-a3a6-4351-88e0-cb3edcf39910","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7433c1e2-a3a6-4351-88e0-cb3edcf39910_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10026","date":"2021-08-25T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7433c1e2-a3a6-4351-88e0-cb3edcf39910_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10026","date":"2021-11-18T20:17:29.140Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7433c1e2-a3a6-4351-88e0-cb3edcf39910_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7433c1e2-a3a6-4351-88e0-cb3edcf39910_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/68c5b22a-a7ce-49b9-bbbf-10e2e543b3b3","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"This evidence along with experimental evidence published by Lyon et al., 1992 (PMID:1495987) and Gardner et al., 1992 (PMID:1509264) will be combined together for a total score of 2 points.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2dbc1287-c481-4765-af36-84dbc64132ea","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Mild hypopigmentation phenotypes were observed in mice with mutations in the mouse p gene.

The authors pointed out that the rhesus model more closely recapitulates some of the eye phenotypes observed in humans, as they have a fovea in which hypopigmentation and/or absence can be observed, where other animal models do not. The authors first examined melanin formation in HEK293T cells following OCA2 knockdown using shRNA and the co-transfection with both wild type TYR with and without either wild type OCA2 or mutant OCA2. No pigmentation was observed in the OCA2 silenced HEK293T cells overexpressing wild type TYR alone. The simulatneous overexpression of wild type OCA2 and wild type TYR resulted in apparent pigmentation. However, the co-transfection of mutant OCA3 and wild type TYR led to significant depigmentation and reduced melanin production. This demonstrated that the OCA2 variant identified in the 6 rhesus monkeys could biologically affect melanin production.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32259106","rdfs:label":"Rhesus Macaque Model","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8ae35ea9-c247-4a40-a145-d281b64cc75e","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"No functional evidence was provided demonstrated that this variant had an effect on the protein product.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ee6d638e-2b3c-4a96-8c1c-a0e96e66c860","type":"Finding","dc:description":"The functional role of the canine OCA2 gene in pigmentation is well known and numerous genetic variants in humans, mice and other vertebrates, lead to oculocutaneous albinism phenotypes that are very similar to the phenotypes observed in the German Spitz dogs.
