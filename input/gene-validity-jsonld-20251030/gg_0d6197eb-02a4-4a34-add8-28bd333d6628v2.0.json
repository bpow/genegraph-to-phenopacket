Later publications described additional *LAMA2* variants in relation to a less severe, adult onset form of muscular dystrophy (PMID: 21922472, PMID: 21953594). Well over 100 unique variants (including missense, nonsense, frameshift, and splicing variants) have been reported in humans. \n\nPer criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found insufficient evidence of a distinct molecular mechanism and a phenotypic spectrum of disease. Both disease entities in the literature (merosin deficient or partially deficient congenital muscular dystrophy (OMIM: 607855) and limb girdle muscular dystrophy (OMIM: 618138)) are caused by loss of function variants leading to variable degrees of reduction of the alpha chain of the laminin 2 protein in a recessive fashion and, therefore, the disease entities have been lumped into one disease entity (autosomal recessive *LAMA2*-related muscular dystrophy). \n\nEvidence ​supporting this gene-disease relationship includes ​case-level data from 9 probands in 7 publications (PMID: 8651294, PMID: 10852549, PMID: 18700894, PMID: 21953594, PMID: 24611677, PMID: 26104111, PMID: 30055037), extending beyond the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points). Of note, \nseveral reported individuals asserted to have a limb girdle muscular dystrophy presentation were evaluated and determined to meet the Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophy GCEP-specified criteria for a limb girdle muscular dystrophy phenotype (progressive weakness in limb musculature (pelvic and shoulder girdle), independent ambulation by the age 2 years, elevated creatine kinase of >2X the upper limit of normal, muscle biopsy with dystrophic and myopathic features): PMID: 21922472; Patient 5, PMID: 21953594; Patients 6 and 8, PMID: 25663498; PMID: 27932089; Patients 1 and 2, PMID: 32904964.\n\nThis gene-disease association is also supported by experimental evidence, including expression, protein interactions, functional alteration, and multiple animal models (PMID: 3278318, PMID: 8000914, PMID: 8188645, PMID: 19692349, PMID: 17438294, PMID: 9710454), also extending beyond the maximum score for experimental evidence (6 points). \n\nIn summary, ​*LAMA2*​​ is definitively associated with ​autosomal recessive muscular dystrophy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Congenital Myopathies Gene Curation Expert Panel on 1/25/2021 and by the ClinGen Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophy Gene Curation Expert Panel on 2/8/2022 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0d6197eb-02a4-4a34-add8-28bd333d6628","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/53f18520-6a7c-4781-ad0e-09250570f10e","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":[{"id":"cg:sopChange"},{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"},{"id":"cg:summaryChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/53f18520-6a7c-4781-ad0e-09250570f10e_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10031","date":"2022-03-14T20:46:21.280Z","role":"Publisher"},{"agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10061","role":"SecondaryContributor"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/53f18520-6a7c-4781-ad0e-09250570f10e_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10031","date":"2022-03-14T20:46:07.096Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/53f18520-6a7c-4781-ad0e-09250570f10e_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/53f18520-6a7c-4781-ad0e-09250570f10e_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d37f7550-87de-47f9-a819-af1fc4206e69","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The Human Protein Atlas also reports enhanced LAMA2 expression in human muscle tissues.","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8acf60ab-8c6d-4d3f-9340-2dd2958bfddf","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Immunofluorescent detection of merosin in multiple human tissues detected bright staining of basement membranes surrounding striated muscle fibers in tongue and other skeletal muscles and Schwann cell basement membranes of peripheral nerves, while the endoneurium and the perineural sheath, epithelial basement membrane of the tongue, skin, walls of arteries, capilaries,  and venules of these tissues were negative.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3278318","rdfs:label":"Expression of Merosin in Human Striated Muscle","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1347e4a9-4a0c-4e4c-94c1-acb3a0094ce4","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Complete absence or partial deficiency of laminin α2 staining evaluated by immunohistochemistry performed in muscle or skin biopsies is a well-documented, diagnostically important feature of LAMA2-related muscular dystrophy.
