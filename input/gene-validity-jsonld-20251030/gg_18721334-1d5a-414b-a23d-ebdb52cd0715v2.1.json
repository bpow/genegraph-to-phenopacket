Seven unique variants (missense, nonsense, and frameshift) have been reported in 5 probands in 2 publications (PMIDs: 28792876, 33942433). In addition to this case-level data experimental evidence includes its biochemical function in the kynurenine pathway (PMID: 7514594) and a knockout mouse model (PMID: 28792876). In summary, *HAAO* is definitively associated with vertebral, cardiac, renal, and limb defects syndrome 1. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.\n\nThis gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the Aminoacidopathy GCEP on 07/10/2020. It was reevaluated on 06/24/2022. As a result of this reevaluation, the classification changed from Limited to Definitive due to a new case reports (PMID: 33942433).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/18721334-1d5a-414b-a23d-ebdb52cd0715","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/89484d6b-0af1-4b77-9dcb-95c18331e3b7","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/89484d6b-0af1-4b77-9dcb-95c18331e3b7_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10011","date":"2022-06-24T17:32:56.631Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/89484d6b-0af1-4b77-9dcb-95c18331e3b7_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10011","date":"2022-06-24T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/89484d6b-0af1-4b77-9dcb-95c18331e3b7_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/89484d6b-0af1-4b77-9dcb-95c18331e3b7_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/34e18d2f-0618-4143-bccb-44ffc58cf050","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Insertion of the human HAAO coding sequence into a eukaryotic expression vector yielded relatively high amounts of the active enzyme in human embryonic kidney HEK-293 cells.
