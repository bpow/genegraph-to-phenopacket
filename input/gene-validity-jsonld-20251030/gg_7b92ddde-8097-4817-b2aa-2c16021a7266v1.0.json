It catalyzes the cyclization of the linear substrate hydroxymethylbilane into uroporphyrinogen III. When UROS activity is reduced, hydroxymethylbilane can spontaneously cyclize into uroporphyrinogen I isomers. Although these isomers, like uroporphyrinogen III, are substrates for the next enzyme in the pathway, UROD (Uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase), the products, coproporphyrinogen I isomers are not a substrate for the subsequent enzyme, CPOX (coproporphyrinogen-III oxidase), in heme synthesis. As a result, the non enzymatically produced uroporphyrinogen I isomers represent a dead end in the pathway (PMID: 19268002).\n\nUROS-related porphyria, like other porphyrias, shows phenotypic variability ranging from mild to severe, with the severity generally correlating with the degree of reduced enzymatic activity. But unlike the semidominant porphyria, PPOX-related variegate porphyria where severe symptoms present at <25% WT enzyme activity, autosomal recessive UROS-related porphyria must have homozygous or biallelic mutations that nearly abolish enzyme function <5% before severe disease manifests. Mutations causing this disease are found throughout the UROS exons and in the promoter region. A common severe presentation is caused by homozygosity for the p.C73R mutation, resulting in less than 1-2% enzymatic activity (PMID: 19268002). Affected individuals may present in utero with non-immune hydrops fetalis due to hemolytic anemia. If they survive infancy, they experience extreme photosensitivity, often leading to disfigurement from severe scarring. Hemolysis is common, and additional described symptoms include red-wine-colored urine, erythrodontia (red-brown-stained teeth), splenomegaly, scleromalacia, and chronic ulcerative keratitis. Biochemical phenotypes include elevated urinary porphyrins (particularly massive amounts of uroporphyrin I), fecal porphyrins, and plasma porphyrins. In the blood, erythrocytes show polychromasia, poikilocytosis, anisocytosis, and basophilic stippling, along with an increase in reticulocytes and nucleated red blood cells. The only known cure for severe disease is bone marrow transplantation which is required as early as possible after birth, to improve chances of its effectiveness (PMID: 30594473, PMID: 31326287).\n\nFor biallelic heterozygotes if enzyme activity is <5%, severe disease often results, but for activity levels between 5-12% of WT mild to moderate disease occurs. Mild to moderate disease may have later onset and symptoms are usually cutaneous photosensitivity which often presents as bullous skin lesions, hypo- or hyperpigmentation of the affected skin, and recurrent skin infections (PMID: 19268002).\n\nSummary of Case Level Data (12 points): 14 probands were scored with 15 unique variants (two splicing mutations, three promoter mutations and ten missense variants in exons). All of the variants scored have been characterized in *E. coli* for their relative enzymatic activity compared to WT.\n\nSummary of Experimental Evidence (2.5 points): Biochemical characterization of the enzymatic reaction was scored (.5 pts). A knock-in mouse model for the P248Q missense mutation reproducing the phenotypes of erythrodontia, moderate photosensitivity, hepatosplenomegaly, and hemolytic anemia was scored at 2 points.\n\nIn summary, UROS has been definitively associated with autosomal recessive UROS-related porphyria.\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7b92ddde-8097-4817-b2aa-2c16021a7266","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9dbf60cb-25ae-44e1-b5aa-598146e63694","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Strong","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9dbf60cb-25ae-44e1-b5aa-598146e63694_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10097","date":"2024-11-02T19:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9dbf60cb-25ae-44e1-b5aa-598146e63694_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10097","date":"2024-11-02T16:04:12.215Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"Replicated over time.","curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9dbf60cb-25ae-44e1-b5aa-598146e63694_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0b7608e0-a930-4179-bd95-ef1cfc007e8b_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d3694da3-2f7f-4144-8761-53f563472a0a","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1.0,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d3694da3-2f7f-4144-8761-53f563472a0a_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"When this protein was expressed in E. coli no residual activity was observed as compared with WT.

After an initial 5-min incubation at 94°C, amplification (30 cycles) was performed with denaturation at 94WC for 1 min, extension at 72°C for 0.5 min, and annealing at the indicated conditions for each primer set (Table I). An aliquot (40 Ml) of each amplification product was incubated with 40 ul of streptavidin-coated paramagnetic beads for 30 min with occasional gentle mixing. Beads with bound biotinylated\nPCR products were separated with a magnet as described (25), the strands were denatured in 10 yl of 0.1 M NaOH for 30 min, and the nonbiotinylated strands were eluted with two 50-sl washes of 0.1 M\nNaOH. The biotinylated strands were washed with 50 MI of the binding and washing buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 1.0 mM EDTA and 2.0 M NaCl) and then with 50 p1 of Tris-EDTA buffer. The biotinylated strands were resuspended in 7 MI of H20 and used as templates for dideoxy chain sequencing (26).
