{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/04059f0f-63f4-4c87-95c7-c904af580d94v1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"*IL21* was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive immunodeficiency, common variable 11 in 2014 (PMID: 24746753). IL-21 is produced predominantly by Tfh cells. Tfh-derived IL-21 potently induces human B cell proliferation, class switching, and plasmablast formation, and promotes plasma cell survival (PMID: 19721453).\nOne missence variant has been reported in one proband with an early-onset IBD and CVID-like immunodeficiency. Compared to a healthy control, the patient had fewer circulating CD19+ B cells and almost no CD19+CD27+IgD+ marginal zone–like and CD19+CD27+IgD− class-switched memory B cells (PMID: 24746753).\n \nExperimental evidence includes expression, biochemical function, functional alteration in patient cells and animal model. Quantitative PCR (q-PCR) analysis of ex vivo isolated CD4+ T-cell subsets  revealed elevated expression of IL-21 by CXCR5hi CD4+ T cells. IL-21 production by TFH cells supports the differentiation of B cells into Ig-secreting cells. Consistently, Ig secretion was reduced by neutralizing endogenous IL-21 by a blocking polyclonal anti-IL-21 Ab (PMID: 19721453).* IL-21* mutant cells did not induce IL-21R signaling, proliferation, or activation of B cells as detected by flow cytometry–based proliferation analysis (PMID: 24746753). In mice, stimulation of IL-21/IL-21R signaling with rIL-21 significantly ameliorates DSS-induced intestinal inflammation (PMID: 27545302).\n \nIn summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship.\nThis classification was approved by the ClinGen Humoral Defects GCEP Working Group on November 29, 2022 (SOP Version 9).\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/04059f0f-63f4-4c87-95c7-c904af580d94","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/82664dca-783a-4ed9-abe5-c77b082a0684","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/82664dca-783a-4ed9-abe5-c77b082a0684_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10080","date":"2022-12-30T12:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/82664dca-783a-4ed9-abe5-c77b082a0684_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10080","date":"2022-12-30T22:19:05.263Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/82664dca-783a-4ed9-abe5-c77b082a0684_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/82664dca-783a-4ed9-abe5-c77b082a0684_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e1f495ff-0058-4d7a-8ccc-e0a55098de6e","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The experiment demonstrated that IL-21/IL-21R signaling plays a protective role in the pathogenesis of DSS-induced acute colitis in mice mainly through regulation of Th cell responses.
