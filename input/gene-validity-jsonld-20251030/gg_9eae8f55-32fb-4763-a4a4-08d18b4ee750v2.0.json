At least 11 unique variants (splicing errors, nonsense, frameshift, and missense) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in 9 probands in 8 publications (PMIDs: 21840233, 28438368, 20855850, 17130438, 16354225, 15033206, 12655555, 12434311). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 2 additional family members. This gene-disease association is supported by the biochemical function of AUH as a 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA hydratase and its altered function in non-patient cells (PMID: 16640564). In summary, AUH is definitively associated with autosomal recessive 3-methylglutaconic aciduria type 1.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9eae8f55-32fb-4763-a4a4-08d18b4ee750","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/681f6747-37ce-498e-8bb1-eddd55a90e2c","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":[{"id":"cg:sopChange"},{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/681f6747-37ce-498e-8bb1-eddd55a90e2c_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10011","date":"2020-06-29T17:42:31.569Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/681f6747-37ce-498e-8bb1-eddd55a90e2c_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10011","date":"2020-09-16T19:23:17.651Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/681f6747-37ce-498e-8bb1-eddd55a90e2c_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/681f6747-37ce-498e-8bb1-eddd55a90e2c_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ef7b975e-ceaa-414b-9d80-a5338385b2d7","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"AUH was kinetically characterized with its natural substrate 3-MG-CoA.
