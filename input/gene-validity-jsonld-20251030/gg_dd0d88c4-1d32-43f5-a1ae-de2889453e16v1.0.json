{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/dd0d88c4-1d32-43f5-a1ae-de2889453e16v1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"The relationship between the SLC38A9 gene and lysosomal storage disorders was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of July 21, 2022. SLC38A9 encodes solute carrier family 38, member 9, a lysosomal amino acid transporter protein involved in regulating the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), via modulating transport of amino acids that stimulate mTORC1 activation (PMID: 25561175, PMID: 25567906) and mediating cholesterol-driven mTORC1 activation (PMID: 28336668). \n\nTo our knowledge, SLC38A9 has not been reported in association with human disease to date. Based on published experimental data, there is minimal evidence suggesting a role for SLC38A9 in lysosomal storage disorders. This experimental evidence (4.50 points total) includes: the biochemical function of the gene product (solute carrier family 38, member 9) being consistent with altered amino acid-mediated signaling of mTORC1 (PMID: 25561175); the physical interaction between SLC38A9 and NPC intracellular cholesterol transporter 1 (PMID: 28336668), a protein encoded by the NPC1 gene, which has been curated as Definitively associated with the lysosomal storage disease Niemann-Pick disease type C1 by the ClinGen Lysosomal Diseases GCEP; functional alteration (impaired amino acid-mediated signaling of mTORC1 in HEK293T cells harboring SLC38A9 variants lacking key amino acid residues involved in interacting with the Ragulator complex (PMID: 25567906); rescue of HEK293T cells harboring SLC38A9 variants lacking key amino acid residues involved in interacting with the Ragulator complex by reexpression of the segment containing these residues (PMID: 25567906); and the abnormal amino acid metabolism seen in a SLC38A9 knockout zebrafish model (PMID: 35457018).\n\nIn summary, there is currently no direct evidence supporting the association between the SLC38A9 gene and lysosomal storage disorders. There is minimal experimental evidence suggesting that the SLC38A9 gene may play a role in lysosomal storage disorders via its role in regulating mTORC1, but additional publications, including those involving human cases, are needed to define the role of the SLC38A9 gene in lysosomal storage disorders. This clinical validity classification was approved by the ClinGen Lysosomal Diseases GCEP on August 2, 2022 (SOP v9).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/dd0d88c4-1d32-43f5-a1ae-de2889453e16","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/34c72694-90be-4ba1-a876-4f77562e7e72","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"NoKnownDiseaseRelationship","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/34c72694-90be-4ba1-a876-4f77562e7e72_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10110","date":"2022-09-29T14:23:18.956Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/34c72694-90be-4ba1-a876-4f77562e7e72_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10110","date":"2022-08-02T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/34c72694-90be-4ba1-a876-4f77562e7e72_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/34c72694-90be-4ba1-a876-4f77562e7e72_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cd47085e-80b5-4911-9d5c-dafdbfefd270","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a831ea69-2bb8-4327-aed8-36559e99ea33","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Knockout zebrafish showed abnormal lysosomal amino acid metabolism, as evinced by elevated levels of multiple free amino acids","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35457018","rdfs:label":"SLC38A9 knockout zebrafish","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/debbd08a-242d-459a-a4f5-7903731b049e","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/25dc4e02-315a-4bec-b04e-7b80c6a99373","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Overexpression  of the Ragulator-binding domain of SLC38A9.1 restored mTORC1 signaling (in response to amino acid deprivation)","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25567906","rdfs:label":"Rescue of SLC38A9 mutants in HEK293T cells","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:PhenotypeRescue"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCellCultureRescueCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":3},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/34c72694-90be-4ba1-a876-4f77562e7e72_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/952b9907-62f4-40c0-a951-e853313bc900","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ea89bb82-2f5d-4543-a00f-640830eebb7e","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"HEK293T cells overexpressing the SLC38A9.2, SLC38A9.4, and the SLC38A9.1 Δ110 variants did not maintain mTORC1 signaling after amino acid withdrawal, consistent with these variants impairing wild-type SLC38A9-mediated activation of mTORC1 in response to amino acid withdrawal ","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25567906","rdfs:label":"SLC38A9 mutants in HEK293T cells"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/34c72694-90be-4ba1-a876-4f77562e7e72_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9778d8e7-5814-41b9-bae2-bb110f3277b7","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8bf30689-92a3-4c0b-b2bc-519a0ae1888c","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Activation of the mTORC1 pathway by SLC38A9 regulation of amino acid transport mediates mTORC1 activity, and thereby lysosomal metabolism","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25561175","rdfs:label":"SLC38A9 regulates lysosomal metabolism ","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/12ba8827-14e4-4f3d-9c16-9b0bdf47ea0c","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bbb3d535-21a4-4f02-b172-c2021c598682","type":"Finding","dc:description":"NPC1, a lysosomal cholesterol transporter, and SLC38A9 were shown to interact physically via co-immunoprecipitation: FLAG-tagged NPC1 immuno-precipitated SLC38A9, as well as other components of the mTORC1 complex, including Ragulator, Rag GTPases, and the vacuolar H+-ATPase (v-ATPase).
