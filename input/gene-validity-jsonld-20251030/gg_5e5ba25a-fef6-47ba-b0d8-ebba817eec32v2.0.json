In humans, ARPP21 was initially identified as a 9.6 kDa protein that regulates calcium/calmodulin-dependent signaling (Rakhilin et al., PMID 15499021). A long isoform of ARPP21 appears to function in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression (Rehfeld et al., PMID 29581509, Halbout et al., PMID 37507022).\n\nNine missense variants that have been reported in 17 probands in four publications (PMIDs: 30811981, 31653410, 35525134, 38960585) are included in this curation. The mechanism of pathogenicity is unknown. This gene-disease association is also supported by expression studies and *in vitro* functional assays (PMIDs: 8120638, 29581509). ARPP21 is predominantly expressed in a subset of brain tissues (PMID 8120638). Endogenous ARPP21 in cultured mouse cortical neurons localizes to stress granules after arsenite treatment (PMID 29581509). \n\nThis gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Spectrum Disorders GCEP on January 10, 2023. It was reevaluated on January 14, 2025. As a result of this reevaluation, the classification did not change. New evidence was added to the curation, but it was not strong enough to change the classification.\n\nIn summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship.\n\nThis classification was approved by the ClinGen ALS GCEP on the meeting date January 14, 2025 (SOP Version 11).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5e5ba25a-fef6-47ba-b0d8-ebba817eec32","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/02d4089a-94dd-42b6-ab09-dc258db00ae9","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","changes":[{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"},{"id":"cg:newEvidence"},{"id":"cg:sopChange"},{"id":"cg:summaryChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/02d4089a-94dd-42b6-ab09-dc258db00ae9_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10096","date":"2025-01-14T20:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/02d4089a-94dd-42b6-ab09-dc258db00ae9_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10096","date":"2025-02-27T21:31:32.904Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["RecurationNewEvidence"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/02d4089a-94dd-42b6-ab09-dc258db00ae9_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/02d4089a-94dd-42b6-ab09-dc258db00ae9_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d5c78c72-a027-45b3-8096-d6cb964d45ff","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Multiple additional sources, e.g. the Human Protein Atlas, support expression of ARPP21 predominantly in various brain tissues.","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6756fb0d-a8e9-4312-8d70-170b0ae3e936","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Expression was only tested in normal human postmortem brain.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8120638","rdfs:label":"in situ hybridization","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e466de56-7b76-4a59-af58-5ae38e704130","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Localization within stress granules upon expression in HeLa cells could be a non-specific phenotype; however, endogenous ARPP21 in mouse neurons also shows localization to stress granules under stress conditions.

This patient presented with a bulbar onset motor neuron disease with progressive limb weakness and\nrespiratory failure, leading to death within 16 months.\n\nThere was a profuse history of ALS in the family (see family tree: II.3, II.8, III.4, III.7, III.10, IV.1, IV.6). Furthermore, an uncle of the proband (II.6), whose son and granddaughter died of ALS and was hence an obligate carrier, was diagnosed with unspecified dementia and died before 50 years of age. After the ARPP21 mutation was detected in the proband, the only affected family member (IV.1) with available DNA was retrospectively confirmed to harbour the same mutation.","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0003690","obo:HP_0002878"],"previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"A targeted ALS gene panel was used to exclude the presence of variants in ALS2, ANG, ANXA11, APP, ATXN2, C9orf72, CCNF, CHCHD10, CHMP2B, DAO, DCTN1, ERBB4, EWSR1, FIG4, FUS, GRN, HNRNPA1, HNRNPA2B1, KIF5A, MAPT, MATR3, NEFH, NEK1, OPTN, PFN1, PSEN1, PSEN2, SETX, SIGMAR1, SOD1, SPG11, SQSTM1, TAF15, TARDBP, TBK1, TIA1, TREM2, TUBA4A, UBQLN2, VAPB, and VCP.","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9521307e-ef11-4935-8395-a329aa6dd048_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38960585","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b765a7ef-7446-4745-927f-d31a3e262f91"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:AlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Heterozygous"}}}},"meetsInclusionCriteria":true,"phenotypePositiveAllelePositive":2,"proband":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0df42b0f-731d-482c-adca-0cb037c85a78"},"sequencingMethod":{"id":"cg:AllGenesSequencing"}},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1e96da7a-d863-45ba-8c88-ea5bbd6ba588_proband_segregation","type":"FamilyCosegregation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38960585","rdfs:label":"Family 7","estimatedLodScore":0.3,"family":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1e96da7a-d863-45ba-8c88-ea5bbd6ba588","type":"Family","rdfs:label":"Family 7","member":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8da3c74a-5d2a-4007-9e01-b0b2ce499065","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38960585","rdfs:label":"Family 7 Patient III.3","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b765a7ef-7446-4745-927f-d31a3e262f91"},"detectionMethod":"Whole genome sequencing was used to identify the putative causative variant; the presence of the variant was validated using Sanger sequencing.
