This heritable platelet function defect is characterized by reduced platelet aggregation and secretion responses to high concentrations of arachidonic acid, the metabolic precursor of thromboxane A2, and U46619, which is a specific thromboxane receptor agonist. However, heterozygosity is insufficient to cause platelet dysfunction that is clinically significant; clinical features, including mild mucocutaneous bleeding, occur only in the presence of a 'second hit' affecting platelet function; this second hit may be either in the *TBXA2R* gene or in another gene affecting the coagulation cascade (summary by Mumford et al., 2010; PMID: 19828703).  Eleven variants (missense, in-frame indel, frameshift, and splicing) have been reported in 11 probands in 8 publications (PMIDs: 21342433, 19828703, 23279270, 24452735, 31389738, 22517902, 31064749, 28983057). This gene-disease association is also supported by its biochemical function in hemostasis (PMID: 9152406), demonstrated functional alteration in patient (PMID: 21342433) and non-patient (PMID: 19828703) cells, and a mouse model that recapitulates the disease (PMID: 9835625). In summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged.\n\nThis gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the HT GCEP on 12/16/2020. It was reevaluated on 04/03/2023 and 07/29/2025. As a result of these reevaluations no new evidence was identified and the classification remained at Moderate (SOP Version 11).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/04d3923b-d576-4299-a96f-33bf56af0431","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ab65570e-c07b-402c-99c0-322df4a86ee4","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","changes":[{"id":"cg:sopChange"},{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"},{"id":"cg:summaryChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ab65570e-c07b-402c-99c0-322df4a86ee4_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2025-09-03T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ab65570e-c07b-402c-99c0-322df4a86ee4_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2025-09-03T12:40:19.654Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["RecurationTiming"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ab65570e-c07b-402c-99c0-322df4a86ee4_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ab65570e-c07b-402c-99c0-322df4a86ee4_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6ebd2cd7-9d9d-4a9b-bcbb-5826c37673fe","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"TXA2, upon binding to TPR, initiates signaling cascades that regulate alterations in the cytoskeleton, platelet adhesion, vesicle trafficking, and other platelet activation responses.
