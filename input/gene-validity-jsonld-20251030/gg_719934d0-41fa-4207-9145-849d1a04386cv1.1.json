Affected individuals present with seizures (varying types) in the first year of life, global developmental delay / intellectual disability, hypotonia, ataxia, and behavioral  abnormalities. Fourteen variants (heterozygous missense) that have been reported in 14 probands in 6 publications (PMIDs: 31972370, 35314505, 35366058, 36090251, 36087422, 36035247) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is reported to be both gain and loss of function. One reported variant is suspected to have a dominant negative effect (PMID: 35314505). \n\nIn addition to case-level evidence, the  gene-disease relationship is  supported by in vitro cell culture functional assays. (PMIDs: 35314505, 36090251, 36087422, 36035247). Depending on the variant, modified *KCNC2* channels showed both gain-of-function (a shift towards a hyperpolarized state with increased time to deactivation) and loss-of-function (reduced total current amplitude). A *KCNC2* knockout mouse model has also been published, however it was not scored given that the *KCNC2* variants seen in humans have been missense rather than truncating (PMID:11124984). \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *KCNC2* and autosomal dominant developmental and epileptic encephalopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.This classification was approved by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism GCEP on the meeting date December 14, 2023 (SOP Version 10).\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/719934d0-41fa-4207-9145-849d1a04386c","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/560c09c7-b58c-4d81-a5e1-d4a76ade613f","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/560c09c7-b58c-4d81-a5e1-d4a76ade613f_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2024-03-07T18:44:33.466Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/560c09c7-b58c-4d81-a5e1-d4a76ade613f_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2023-12-14T07:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["ErrorClarification","NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/560c09c7-b58c-4d81-a5e1-d4a76ade613f_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/560c09c7-b58c-4d81-a5e1-d4a76ade613f_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f5e3507c-2c86-4e02-b0c8-602bc81bcd40","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Knock out mouse model not scored because the KCNC2 variants reported in humans have been missense rather than truncating.
