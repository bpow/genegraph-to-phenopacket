Variants in SUCLG1 were first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Leigh syndrome spectrum in 2010 (PMID 19526370). At least 16 unique variants predicted to cause a loss of or reduced function of the protein have been reported in ClinVar, suggesting homozygous loss of function is the mechanism of disease for this gene. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 6 probands with Leigh syndrome spectrum in 5 publications (PMID19526370, 20197121, 20693550, 20453710, 29217198). This gene-disease association is further supported by the function of the gene product, protein interaction, expression, and alterations in patient cell lines.  In summary, there is moderate evidence to support the relationship between SUCLG1 and autosomal recessive Leigh syndrome spectrum. This classification was approved by the NICHD U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on March 25, 2019 (SOP Version 6).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/399555c3-fa80-43d7-a1d1-566d0db9b3f2","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fd0a5a96-69b8-47fb-9b7b-17de29439ecc","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fd0a5a96-69b8-47fb-9b7b-17de29439ecc_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2019-04-18T18:14:48.882Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fd0a5a96-69b8-47fb-9b7b-17de29439ecc_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fd0a5a96-69b8-47fb-9b7b-17de29439ecc_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fd0a5a96-69b8-47fb-9b7b-17de29439ecc_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fb3481a4-6f55-4cc3-b719-7788da97f1fc","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"One cell culture model with disrupted gene function showing mitochondrial dysfunction in non-neuronal cell type.
