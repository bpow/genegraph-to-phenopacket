An inherited defect in *PTGS1* is specifically linked to defective platelet aggregation with arachidonic acid and absence of the second wave response to epinephrine, ADP and collagen but normal response with TXA2 agonists. Several such patients with mild bleeding have been reported either with autosomal dominant or, more recently, autosomal recessive transmission of variants in *PTGS1* (reviewed in PMID: 33147934). Patients may lack protein or have a functionally defective, potentially dominant negative, but normally expressed enzyme. While the clinical and laboratory phenotype of COX-1 deficiency appear to be well established, the mode of inheritance for this pathology remains to be fully elucidated but is currently curated as semi-dominant to consider both dominant and recessive cases.\n\nThus far, five unique variants (both missense and in-frame deletions) have been reported in five patients from three publications (PMIDs: 32299908, 28983057, 28748566). Additionally, another *PTGS1* missense variant (NM_000962:exon5:c.412T>C (p.W138R)) was identified in an affected mother and her affected son by an expert member of the Hemostasis/Thrombosis GCEP. Both individuals had normal platelet count and size and normal platelet surface glycoprotein expression. In addition, they presented with absent aggregation to AA and and reduced to low dose collagen with a normal response to endoperoxide analog suggesting a cyclooxygenase deficiency. This gene-disease relationship is supported by its biochemical function (PMID: 7947975) in platelet activation and preferential expression at high levels in selected cells, including endothelium, monocytes, platelets, renal collecting tubules, and seminal vesicles (PMID: 18657230). As well as altered function and expression in patients (PMID: 32299908). Additional functional alteration in non-patient cells showed the *PTGS1* N143S variant caused a dominant-negative effect of the COX-1 enzyme activity and reduced downstream TXB2 synthesis (PMID: 33326144) and homozygous mutant mice showed reduced platelet aggregation, which was similar to the patient phenotypes (PMID: 8521478). In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1e62f04f-2f75-4e45-b0b4-fcbf78222c14","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d979e26e-bf9b-4f6a-a37c-2df0f2d35129","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d979e26e-bf9b-4f6a-a37c-2df0f2d35129_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2023-02-01T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d979e26e-bf9b-4f6a-a37c-2df0f2d35129_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2023-02-01T15:19:12.526Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d979e26e-bf9b-4f6a-a37c-2df0f2d35129_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cba248b2-8d0b-4d6b-9372-d1124fc283c3_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/46843d6e-ffd2-49da-bd09-bc8647a1254d","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The novel p.Asn143Ser substitution is located at the N-terminal of the COX-1 catalytic domain at a highly conserved residue and immunoblotting analysis revealed a second COX-1 protein band with lower molecular weight in the proband, which is consistent with the predicted hypo-glycosylated COX-1 variant.","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/46843d6e-ffd2-49da-bd09-bc8647a1254d_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"In PMID:33326144 HEK 293 T cells were transfected with either wild-type (Asn143) or mutated (Ser143) enzyme vector.

These data strongly support that the p.Ans143Ser variant has a dominant-negative effect in COX-1 activity.\n\nIn the second model, it showed the similar results- the TXB2 synthesis was abolished in cells stably expressing Ser143 COX1 and co expression of wild-type Asn143 COX-1 partially recovered TXB2 production, but following a non-linear dose dependent pattern.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33326144","rdfs:label":"The dominant negative effect of the PTGS1 N143S variant "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d979e26e-bf9b-4f6a-a37c-2df0f2d35129_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b0f47458-049a-498c-a2b2-c330fd3c4726","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Was shown to function as a dual cyclooxygenase and peroxidase in the biosynthesis pathway of prostanoids.
