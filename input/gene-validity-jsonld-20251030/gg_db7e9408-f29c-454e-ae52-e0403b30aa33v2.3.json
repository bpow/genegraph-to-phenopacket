In primary skin fibroblasts from FRAXE patients (n = 8), there was a significant reduction in the number, but a significant increase in the size, of nuclear speckles, when compared with controls. Because nuclear speckles are enriched with factors involved in pre-mRNA processing, the authors explored the consequence of these defects on the transcriptome. Whole genome expression profiling using RNA extracted from cell lines identified 27 genes significantly deregulated by at least 2-fold in the patients. Among these genes, the immediate early response gene FOS was significantly upregulated. JUN, which encodes a protein that forms a transcriptional activator complex with FOS, was significantly upregulated in the patients' cell lines upon mitogen stimulation. These results suggest that FMR2 is an upstream regulator of FOS and JUN. FOS and JUN are members of the AP-1 complex, a transcription complex known to play a role in cell proliferation and neuronal activation.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23562910","rdfs:label":"Functional alteration in patient cells"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ab4216e3-61b7-4542-ad3a-8788a7ef8b63_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2faf4b1f-715c-4ff1-b8d2-353f035bf458","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Score downgraded because Aff2 knock-out mice exhibit increased LTP, whereas decreased LTP is normally associated with memory impairment.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d750b51e-a352-4408-8a5f-1ee2a5cac0eb","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Male mice lacking Fmr2 (Aff2) showed a delay-dependent conditioned fear impairment.
