{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b08c2668-6571-4199-813b-95606bb1e65bv1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"The IKBKG gene is located on chromosome X at Xq28 and encodes the regulatory (γ) subunit of the inhibitor of kappaB kinase (IKK) complex (or NEMO protein), which activates NF-κB. The IKBKG gene was first reported in relation to X-linked incontinentia pigmenti (IP) in 2000 (Smahi et al., 2000 PMID 10839543​). The major diagnostic criteria of the disease, which primarily affects heterozygous females, include skin lesions. Minor criteria include teeth, hair, nail, eye and central nervous system defects. Variants in the gene are also associated with ectodermal dysplasias and immune-deficiency syndromes in hemizygous males, including immunodeficiency (ID), anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia with immunodeficiency (EDA-ID) and anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia-immunodeficiency-osteopetrosis-lymphedema syndrome (OL-EDA-ID) (Smahi et al., 2002). Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found differences in molecular mechanism, inheritance pattern and phenotypic variability between IP and the ectodermal dysplasia/immunodeficiency syndromes, but little difference in these between ID, EDA-ID and OL-EDA-ID. Therefore, IP (OMIM:308300) has been split from ID, ID-EDA-ID and OL-EDA-ID, and the following disease entities, ID (OMIM:300636), EDA-ID (OMIM:300291), and OL-EDA-ID, have been lumped into one disease entity, IKBKG-related immunodeficiency with or without ectodermal dysplasia. Twenty-two variants (missense, nonsense, frameshift and large deletion) that have been reported in 23 IP probands in 3 publications (PMIDs: 10839543, 33085210 and 18350553) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is known to be loss of function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by expression and functional alteration studies, as well as animal models (PMIDs: 10911991, 15229184, 28702714, 10911991, 10911992). The IKBKG gene encodes the regulatory subunit of the IKK complex, which activates cytokine-associated genes through the activation of the NF-κB pathway. Expression studies showed defective IKBKG protein expression in human IP patient cells (PMID 10911991) and functional alteration studies show little to no NF-κB activation in IKBKG-deficient cells (PMIDs: 15229184, 28702714). Two mouse models showed that skin lesions, dermatopathy and increased apoptosis leading to skewed X-chromosome inactivation, all disease characteristics of IP, were recapitulated in female mice heterozygous for loss-of-function Ikbkg variants (PMIDs: 10911991, 10911992). In summary, IKBKG is definitively associated with X-linked incontinentia pigmenti. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Syndromic Disorders Gene Curation Expert Panel on the meeting date 06.01.2022 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b08c2668-6571-4199-813b-95606bb1e65b","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/092ed3e1-8a02-4c71-8134-24c4dc8d3a69","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/092ed3e1-8a02-4c71-8134-24c4dc8d3a69_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10060","date":"2022-06-30T16:18:19.235Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/092ed3e1-8a02-4c71-8134-24c4dc8d3a69_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10060","date":"2022-06-23T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/092ed3e1-8a02-4c71-8134-24c4dc8d3a69_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/092ed3e1-8a02-4c71-8134-24c4dc8d3a69_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/523e2a95-64b6-4a5f-af9a-5ef8fab6d231","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b81e4bad-d08b-409f-9f74-80872cf22536","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Ikky+/- females \"develop a unique dermatopathy characterized by keratinocyte hyperproliferation, skin inflammation, hyperkeratosis, and increased apoptosis.
