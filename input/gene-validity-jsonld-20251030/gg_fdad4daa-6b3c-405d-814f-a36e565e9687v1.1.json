The *NDUFS6* gene encodes an accessory subunit of complex I of the mitochondrial respiratory chain.\n\nThe *NDUFS6* gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive mitochondrial disease in 2004 (PMID: 15372108). While various names have been given to the constellation of features seen in those with *NDUFS6*-related disease, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *NDUFS6* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included three unique homozygous loss of function variants, one homozygous missense variant present in two cases, and one compound heterozygous pair of a loss of function and a missense variant identified in six cases from four publications (PMIDs:15372108, 19259137, 22200994, 30948790). These individuals had profound hypotonia and lethargy shortly after birth, abnormal drifting eye movements, rotatory nystagmus, seizures, absent Moro and grasp reflexes, variable (diminished to brisk) tendon reflexes, lactic acidemia, and hypoventilation leading to infantile death.  The Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel reviewed scoring homozygous variants in cases with consanguinity and decided that no scoring alteration was needed in these three cases given (1) comprehensive analyses (exome sequencing) were performed, (2) homozygous variants are a common cause of mitochondrial disease, and (3) biochemical evidence in these cases supported a complex I defect. Segregation data are available but did not meet criteria to be considered for scoring per ClinGen Gene Curation SOP V8. This gene-disease association is also supported by the known biochemical function and animal models (PMIDs: 27509854, 22474353, 25902503, 19672299).\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support this gene-disease relationship, including that more than three years have elapsed since the first proposal of the association. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on January 31, 2022 (SOP Version 8).\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fdad4daa-6b3c-405d-814f-a36e565e9687","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/04cdc50a-1ce4-410e-88bb-9d75ed33bb46","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/04cdc50a-1ce4-410e-88bb-9d75ed33bb46_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2022-01-31T05:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/04cdc50a-1ce4-410e-88bb-9d75ed33bb46_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2022-10-11T21:43:38.411Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/04cdc50a-1ce4-410e-88bb-9d75ed33bb46_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/04cdc50a-1ce4-410e-88bb-9d75ed33bb46_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/dcd54823-2691-4404-adab-70ebd2b4308d","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The  encoded protein interacts with 10+ gene products  associated with LS.","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5d0a7f13-03eb-4ad6-9d02-469f234935b3","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Complex 1 has 45 subunits.

This resulted in reduced expression of Ndufs6 protein in various tissues, especially the heart (Fig. 2B). Complex I (CI) activity was also decreased most markedly in heart, representing ∼10% of normal CI activity (Fig. 2C). Ndufs6gt/gt mice had an isolated CI defect as the cardiac activities of OXPHOS complexes II, III, and IV were normal (Fig. 3A). Isolated heart mitochondria from Ndufs6gt/gt mice showed a decreased capacity to generate ATP from substrates oxidized via CI but not via CII (Fig. 3B). From as early as 30d of age, cardiac enlargement was evident in Ndufs6gt/gt mice and more pronounced in males, with a near doubling of heart weight (Fig. 1A) and the heart-to-body weight ratio (Fig. 1B). Myocardial ultrastructure revealed mitochondrial morphology to be abnormal in Ndufs6gt/gt mice, with the central area frequently denser than the periphery (Fig. 5F). The mice showed cardiomyopathy, including markedly diminished functional capacity and a predisposition to heart failure (Fig. 4, Fig. 6, Table 1). Greatest reduction in CI activity in the heart is consistent with the cardiac phenotype observed in the mice, but the tissue variability does not recapitulate the apparently systemic CI defect observed in patients. Limited comparison to clinical phenotype in human patients can be made due to neonatal death of patients (consistent with neonatal lethality of total KO in mice). Overall, establishes link between gene knockdown, impaired CI activity, and disease, albeit in a tissue-specific manner.
