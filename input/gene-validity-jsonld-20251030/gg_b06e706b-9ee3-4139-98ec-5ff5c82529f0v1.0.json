This association was made using case-level data and experimental evidence. At least 8 unique variants (e.g. missense, nonsense, frameshift) have been reported in humans. TMIE was first associated with this disease in humans as early as 2002 (Naz et al.​). Association is seen in at least 8 or probands in 3 publications (PMIDs: 12145746, 19438934, 24416283). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 11 additional family members. This gene-disease association is supported by expression studies, knockout mouse models, biochemical function studies, protein interaction studies and a rescue in a mouse model (PMIDs: 25467981, 25475183, 19934034, 12140191). In summary, TMIE is definitively associated with autosomal recessive non-syndromic hearing loss. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hearing Loss Working Group on 9/29/2017.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b06e706b-9ee3-4139-98ec-5ff5c82529f0","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b025a472-0a48-469c-a5f3-70df12ade334","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b025a472-0a48-469c-a5f3-70df12ade334_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b025a472-0a48-469c-a5f3-70df12ade334_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2017-09-29T04:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b025a472-0a48-469c-a5f3-70df12ade334_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b025a472-0a48-469c-a5f3-70df12ade334_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/84e7e2f5-23cb-4feb-a5e5-f7a326ed9adb","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1f1cab59-87d1-42e6-b014-0b2ad93d9aa4","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Observed cochlear expression of TMIE, found that hearing in the spinner mouse was impaired and that TMIE was not present in spinner mouse.
