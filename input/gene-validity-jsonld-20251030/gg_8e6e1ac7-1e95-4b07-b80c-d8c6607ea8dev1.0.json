The TSFM gene encodes the mitochondrial translation elongation factor Ts.\n\nThe TSFM gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Leigh syndrome spectrum in 2014 (PMID: 25037205). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included three variants identified in three cases in three publications (PMIDs: 25037205, 27677415, 30297209). No segregation data were available. Loss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease association is also supported by known biochemical function, expression, and functional alteration in patient cells (PMIDs: 27977873, 25613900, 17033963).\n\nIn summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on January 13, 2020 (SOP Version 7).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8e6e1ac7-1e95-4b07-b80c-d8c6607ea8de","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e3d30a3f-a054-4812-9b97-116a8834fcb1","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e3d30a3f-a054-4812-9b97-116a8834fcb1_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2020-02-12T19:55:29.785Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e3d30a3f-a054-4812-9b97-116a8834fcb1_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e3d30a3f-a054-4812-9b97-116a8834fcb1_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/936630f1-148d-422f-83be-efe9887c9974_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Increased points based on in silico and functional evidence for p.C315Y.
