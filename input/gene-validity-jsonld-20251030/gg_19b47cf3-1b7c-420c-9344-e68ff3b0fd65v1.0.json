The LONP1 gene encodes a mitochondrial protease with important roles in proteostasis.\n\nThe LONP1 gene has been reported only once in relation to autosomal recessive Leigh syndrome spectrum, in 2018 (PMID: 29518248).  However, defects of this gene are also associated with other mitochondrial phenotypes outside the scope of the Leigh syndrome spectrum gene-disease curation, including CODAS syndrome (cerebral, ocular, dental, auricular, and skeletal anomalies). Evidence supporting the relationship between LONP1 and Leigh syndrome spectrum includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included two variants identified in one case in one publication (PMID: 29518248). No segregation data were available. Loss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease association is also supported by expression and animal models (PMIDs: 18853439, 32521756).\n\nIn summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on December 16, 2020 (SOP Version 7).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/19b47cf3-1b7c-420c-9344-e68ff3b0fd65","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3da0a308-3a7e-4101-b40b-1f23db106aea","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3da0a308-3a7e-4101-b40b-1f23db106aea_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2021-04-09T14:02:25.454Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3da0a308-3a7e-4101-b40b-1f23db106aea_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2021-04-09T14:02:15.539Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3da0a308-3a7e-4101-b40b-1f23db106aea_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3da0a308-3a7e-4101-b40b-1f23db106aea_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6b5a671d-485e-4594-99f2-8bd2cd5c0cc2","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Scored 0.5 for embryonic lethality (default).
