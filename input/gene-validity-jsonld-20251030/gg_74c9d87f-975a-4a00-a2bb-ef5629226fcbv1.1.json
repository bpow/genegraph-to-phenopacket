CATSHL syndrome shows a continuum of disorder with more severe phenotypes in biallelic cases, and less severe phenotypes in monoallelic cases. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found differences in phenotypic variability. Therefore, the following disease entities have been split into multiple disease entities, SADDAN (OMIM:616482), Hypochondroplasia (OMIM:146000), Achondroplasia (OMIM: 100800), *FGFR3*-related Thanatophoric Dysplasia (Type I OMIM:187600 and Type II OMIM:187601), Crouzon Syndrome with acanthosis nigricans (OMIM:612247), Muenke Syndrome (OMIM:602849), and CATSHL Syndrome (OMIM:610474). The split curations for these gene disease relationships have been curated separately. 2 missense variants are associated with CATSHL syndrome and have been reported in 3 probands in 3 publications (PMIDs: 17033969, 27139183, 24864036).
