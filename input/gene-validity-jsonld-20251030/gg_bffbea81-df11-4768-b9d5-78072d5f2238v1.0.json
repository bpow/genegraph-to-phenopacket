At least four unique variants (missense, nonsense, splice-site, deletion) were reported in four individuals with CHD (PMID: 28512736, 32859249, 33084842), but only the splice-site variant was included in this curation. The rest were not scored due to presence of variants in other CHD-related genes or high frequencies on gnomAD v4. Of note, there are 4 CNVs encompassing *MYH11* and several other genes reported in individuals with CHD (PMIDs: 22318994, 23979609). In summary, there is limited evidence supporting the relationship between *MYH11* and autosomal dominant congenital heart disease. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Congenital Heart Disease GCEP on the meeting date October 15th, 2024 (SOP Version 11).
