AMACR encodes an enzyme that interconverts pristanoyl-CoA and C27-bile acylCoAs between their (R)- and (S)-stereoisomers. The conversion to the (S)-stereoisomers is necessary for degradation of these substrates by peroxisomal beta-oxidation. Patients with *AMACR* variants present typically with neuropathy and retinitis pigmentosa, with elevated pristanic acid levels. *AMACR* was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive AMACR deficiency in 2000 (Ferdinandusse et al, PMID: 10655068).\n   \nSummary of Case Level Data (8.1 points):\nAt least 8 patients across 7 publications have been reported with the same homozygous missense variant, Ser52Pro (PMIDs: 10655068, 12512044, 21686617, 21576695, 20821052, 15249642, 33047465). A few other missense variants have also been reported (PMID: 10655068, 20921516, 23286897, 34267495). A deletion encompassing 5 genes including AMACR is reported in a patient with oculocutaneous albinism and AMACR deficiency (PMID: 22987308). This evidence cannot be scored in the GCI, but warrants a score of 1 point. The mechanism is expected to be homozygous loss of function. \n  \nSummary of experimental data (2 points):\nThis gene-disease association is supported by a mouse model that recapitulates the human biochemical phenotype (PMID 25168382). The enzyme is highly expressed in peroxisomes, followed by mitochondria (PMID: 7649182). \n  \nIn summary, this gene-disease relationship of *AMACR* and AMACR deficiency is classified as Moderate. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3df3590a-b147-4a96-8882-4766fce31330","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3fb8a3ea-cf06-4788-841f-e787f3780a49","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","changes":{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3fb8a3ea-cf06-4788-841f-e787f3780a49_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10049","date":"2022-03-31T04:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3fb8a3ea-cf06-4788-841f-e787f3780a49_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10049","date":"2023-01-06T15:02:19.757Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3fb8a3ea-cf06-4788-841f-e787f3780a49_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d04b7a70-9adb-48be-9e5a-63041b64f3e0_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d04b7a70-9adb-48be-9e5a-63041b64f3e0","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12512044","rdfs:label":"Setchell_Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDiagnosis","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":8,"allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e5374b38-9973-4864-96aa-a30191259c0a","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_014324.6(AMACR):c.154T>C (p.Ser52Pro)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA117565"}},"detectionMethod":"Exons 1 to 5 of AMACR was sequenced","firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"Proband was first seen at 2w of age for hematochezia secondary to coagulopathy.

Mutant mice had significantly reduced C24 species but a strongly increased concentration of C27 precursors.\n\nSerum and liver concentrations of both conjugated and unconjugated C27 intermediates were increased by 100–450% in Amacr−/− mice as compared with wild-type and the concentrations of C24 bile acids were decreased by 50–85%.\n\nPhytanic (0.52±0.28) and pristanic acids (0.23±0.07 mM) were elevated when mice were fed the phytol diet. The phytol diet led to weight reduction and hepatomegaly and liver damage, with fatpads of the mutant mice being 62% less than those of wild-type. No motor neuron deficits were observed in mutant mice, measured by hanging and grid tests.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15016763","rdfs:label":"Savolainen_Mouse","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"evidenceStrength":"Moderate","sequence":5725,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria7","strengthScore":9.1,"subject":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/j2hM2MHx99c","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0013681","gene":"hgnc:451","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"2.2","websiteLegacyID":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/assertion_3fb8a3ea-cf06-4788-841f-e787f3780a49-","@context":{"@vocab":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"},"curationReasons":{"@type":"@vocab","@container":"@set"},"GCISnapshot":{"@type":"@id"},"dc:isVersionOf":{"@type":"@id"},"websiteLegacyID":{"@type":"@id"}}}
