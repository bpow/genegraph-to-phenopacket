Cysteine substitutions and stop gain variants in this gene are highly specific to TD1, and are highly causative, and for this reason they are scored at a higher level in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. This gene-disease association is also supported by experimental evidence including assays showing increased binding activity of variant FGFR3 receptor protein (PMIDs: 9438390, 8640234, 14751560). In summary, FGFR3 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant Thanatophoric Dysplasia Type I. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Skeletal Disorders Gene Curation Expert Panel on 12/6/2021. \nGene Clinical Validity Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) – Version 8.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2888c8be-30c0-4bb2-ac1d-616310392ab1","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/db0459d9-c5cc-455d-a6b2-e6ea81511336","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/db0459d9-c5cc-455d-a6b2-e6ea81511336_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10065","date":"2021-12-23T22:19:01.367Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/db0459d9-c5cc-455d-a6b2-e6ea81511336_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10065","date":"2021-12-23T22:18:50.458Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/db0459d9-c5cc-455d-a6b2-e6ea81511336_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/db0459d9-c5cc-455d-a6b2-e6ea81511336_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6325cb4d-541b-45fb-bbee-f5d137a1ebe4","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3b5cd774-cf5f-426d-b6e4-7c1934c4c354","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"NIH3T3 transfected with Arg248Cys, Ser249Cys, Tyr373Cys had strongly increased receptor glycosylation, and strongly increase Stat1 and Stat5 protein expression.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14751560","rdfs:label":"Legeai-Mallet Assay"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/dfc67e85-3595-45e2-8ce9-cc2e0568bc8d","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1f43885d-57c0-4f7d-a216-fc4740bbf9d9","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"R248C and S249C showed approximately 4-fold increase in luciferase activity compared to wild-type.
