This association was made using case-level and case-control data. At least 11 variants (missense, in-frame indel, nonsense, frameshift) have been reported in humans. MYO1A was first associated with this disease in humans as early as 2003 (Donaudy et al.). Of the 11 published variants, one is supported by a functional study, and 10 are refuted by high frequency in gnomAD, nonsegregation with disease, or confirmed alternate cause of disease. A knock-out mouse model does not replicate the hearing loss phenotype. In summary, there is convincing evidence refuting the association between MYO1A and autosomal dominant nonsyndromic hearing loss, which significantly outweighs the evidence supporting the association. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hearing Loss Working Group on 1/16/18.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/19930400-2543-45eb-85a0-8d936f396612","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3dcc24f7-4cf7-413b-a956-16ad58bcbd36","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3dcc24f7-4cf7-413b-a956-16ad58bcbd36_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2018-01-16T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3dcc24f7-4cf7-413b-a956-16ad58bcbd36_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"24616153; Eisenberger 2014 Identified one heterozygous nonsense variant in MYO1A in a 4-y/o with congenital profound HL- did not segregate with HL in family, girl was found to have homozygous missense MYO7A variants, diagnosed with probable pre-RP Usher. A second congenitally deaf patient from consanguineous family found to have heterozygous nonsense MYO1A variant. Again, alternate cause was found- homozygosity for previously reported missense variant in CIB2. Finally, a third case with one of the variants reported in Donaudy (p.G662E) had several nonsegregations (two hearing as well as one hearing-impaired family members carried variant). Paper noted that four out of eight Donaudy 2003 variants are present in dbSNP/ESP. 27759032; Patton 2017 identified 12 individuals with MYO1A variants (either reported in Donaudy 2003 or predicted LOF) by WES. None had hearing loss outside that expected for age. There was no association between hearing loss and presence of MYO1A variants.","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3dcc24f7-4cf7-413b-a956-16ad58bcbd36_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ac7978ef-de8f-4a09-bcc0-03cf3b299d83_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Variant present in 227/25792 (0.9%) Ashkenazi Jewish alleles. 985/126674 (0.8%) European (Non-Finnish) alleles and 5 homozygotes in gnomAD.","direction":"Contradicts","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b4957b19-9c13-4710-95cb-c045b87efbfd","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12736868","rdfs:label":"Donaudy 7","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":6,"detectionMethod":"","phenotypeFreeText":"moderate sensorineural hearing loss, early onset","previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ac7978ef-de8f-4a09-bcc0-03cf3b299d83_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12736868","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/42dea873-19ba-4c36-bd94-fc563c1de8f0","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001256041.1(MYO1A):c.2390C>T (p.Ser797Phe)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/178620"}}}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityUncategorizedProbandCriteria"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8c888dc7-6d33-4ce2-ae74-560b212ee23f_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Variant was inherited from an unaffected father.
