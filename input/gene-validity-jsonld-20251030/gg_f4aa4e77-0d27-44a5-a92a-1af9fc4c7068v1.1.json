There is abundant evidence published associating the MEN1 gene with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1, since the gene-disease relationship was first proposed by Chandrasekharappa SC, et al., 1997 (PMID: 9103196). Multiple case level studies have been performed with MEN1 patients that have variants in the MEN1 gene. The variants include single amino acid changes or deletions that affect the stability of the protein and nonsense or frameshift LOF variants. A significant amount of case-level data is available; the maximum points for genetic evidence has been reached (12 points). Multiple mouse models of MEN1 have been established to show development of tumors consistent with MEN1 syndrome. In summary, MEN1 is definitively associated with the autosomal autosomal dominant Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 1 syndrome. This has been demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f4aa4e77-0d27-44a5-a92a-1af9fc4c7068","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a40ef20e-115c-4667-b4a2-6c7c8fb07a49","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a40ef20e-115c-4667-b4a2-6c7c8fb07a49_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10023","date":"2021-01-11T23:30:32.904Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a40ef20e-115c-4667-b4a2-6c7c8fb07a49_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10023","date":"2020-05-13T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10018","role":"SecondaryContributor"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a40ef20e-115c-4667-b4a2-6c7c8fb07a49_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a40ef20e-115c-4667-b4a2-6c7c8fb07a49_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2750e1d4-6ddb-4b2c-98ba-e0397bde71f0","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Since this score is taking into consideration several mouse models of MEN1 that are all LOF variation (single exon excision to multiple exon excisions), and all mice recapitulate tumor formation due to the MEN1 genetic variation alone, I have increased the points to maximum.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b43893da-c941-44cc-a511-7b3a6b3c0d2f","type":"Finding","dc:description":"All of the models reviewed here show development of tumors in multiple tissues (parathyroid glands, gut and pancreas, pituitary gland, adrenal gland and others) which are consistent with the MEN1 disease, albeit the frequency of tumor formation varies dependent on the strain and mutation.
