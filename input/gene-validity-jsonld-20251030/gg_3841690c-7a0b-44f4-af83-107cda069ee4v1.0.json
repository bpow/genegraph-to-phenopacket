Severe congenital neutropenia is a heterogeneous disorder of hematopoiesis characterized by a maturation arrest of granulopoiesis with low peripheral blood absolute neutrophil counts and early onset of severe bacterial infections. Eleven variants (missense, in-frame deletion, nonsense, frameshift, and canonical splice) that have been reported in 10 probands in 2 publications (PMIDs: 19118303, 37296469) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached (if applicable). The mechanism of pathogenicity is known to be loss of function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by mouse models, cell culture models, and in vitro functional assays. (PMIDs: 23686134, 30626647, 21385794, 25492228, and 17318259). G6PC3 deficiency results in defective neutrophil maturation and neutropenia, and has also been shown to result in defect neutrophil glycosylation. In summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between G6PC3 and autosomal recessive severe congenital neutropenia. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation GCEP on the meeting date August 7, 2024 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3841690c-7a0b-44f4-af83-107cda069ee4","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ff1ec187-3779-4437-b17b-fa406fafc406","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ff1ec187-3779-4437-b17b-fa406fafc406_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10135","date":"2024-08-07T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ff1ec187-3779-4437-b17b-fa406fafc406_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10135","date":"2024-08-08T14:18:04.564Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ff1ec187-3779-4437-b17b-fa406fafc406_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ff1ec187-3779-4437-b17b-fa406fafc406_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bca350ba-5157-4556-95d5-afbe8739a969","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"No recapitulation of human phenotype","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e4297715-a424-4c9e-a24e-58a129be722b","type":"Finding","dc:description":"These phenotypes are not observed in humans with G6PC3-related disease per MONDO or OMIM","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17023421","rdfs:label":"Wang knockout mouse","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":0},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d27fb644-392e-4d79-9a9f-c8ca037e2de7","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Reduced by half for only examining the neutropenia phenotype and not the other phenotypes observed in G6PC3-deficiency patients.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ea8a69fd-b911-42a1-9007-175ad6135ae0","type":"Finding","dc:description":"G6PC3-KO mice were known to be neutropenic.
