Parkinson's disease is a progressive degenerative disorder of the central nervous system characterized by loss of dopamine producing neurons in the substantia nigra, and Lewy bodies in the substantia nigra and locus coeruleus are found in most cases. Signs and symptoms include tremor which is most pronounced during rest, muscle rigidity, slowing of voluntary movements (bradykinesia), and a tendency to fall back (postural instability). One clearly pathogenic missense variant (p.Asp620Asn) has been reported in more than 60 patients by different authors/groups from different ethnicities (Struhal et al., PMID:24557499; Trinh et al., PMID: 30357936, https://www.mdsgene.org/). Five of these publications are included in this curation. The additional evidence from the literature was not included in this curation because the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. Several reports also found additional missense variants in VPS35 such as p.Pro316Ser, p.Arg524Trp, or p.Leu774Met that might be causative for Parkinson's disease, however, these variants have not been included in the curation of VPS35 due to limited evidence. The disease follows an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance with age-dependent penetrance (Trinh et al., PMID: 25330418; https://www.mdsgene.org/). The midbrain and braintem neuropathology of VPS35 p.Asp620Asn has yet to be reported, but examination of the cortex and basal ganglia in one case (46 years at onset with 8 years disease duration) was normal with no neuronal loss, gliosis, senile plaques, neurofibrillary tangles or intraneuronal inclusions, and immunostaining for α-synuclein was negative (Wider et al., PMID: 18342564). The encoded protein, Vacuolar Protein Sorting 35, is a critical component of the retromer cargo-recognition complex that is composed of VPS35, VPS26 and VPS29. Any perturbation to wild-type retromer subunit stoichiometry (VPS35:VPS26:VPS29) is neurotoxic (Munsie et al., PMID: 25416282). The retromer recycles membrane-associated proteins between endosomes and the trans-Golgi network or the plasma membrane (Seaman. PMID: 33526371). The VPS35 gene-disease association is supported by recurrent experimental evidence including in-vitro functional assays and knock-in mice models for the p.Asp620Asn change. The proposed mechanism of pathogenicity is gain-of-function (GOF, Tsika et al., PMID: 24740878). It has been shown that VPS35 acts upstream of LRRK2, another gene where mutations cause autosomal dominant Parkinson's disease. VPS35 plays a role in regulating LRRK2 kinase catalytic activity with the p.Asp620Asn mutation increasing autophosphorylation of LRRK2 and phosphorylation of targets of LRRK2´s kinase activity (Mir et al., PMID: 29743203; Kadgien et al., PMID: 34530877). Non-human cell lines overexpressing hVPS35:Asp620Asn and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons from patients with the p.Asp620Asn mutation show changes related to altered endosomal and retromer function (Follet et al., PMID: 24152121; Zavodszky et al., PMID: 24819384; Bono et al., PMID: 33032646; Hanss et al., PMID: 33142012; Cui et al., PMID: 33347683). Specifically, VPS35 p.Asp620Asn disrupts interactions with the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome and SCAR homolog (WASH) complex, likely via FAM21 (McGough et al., PMID: 24980502; Zavodszky et al., PMID: 24819384). Further investigations in mutant knock-in animal models demonstrated altered dopamine metabolism, loss of dopaminergic neurons, and motor deficits in aged animals (Wang et al., PMID: 25288323; Cataldi et al., PMID: 30155515; Chen et al., PMID: 30842285; Niu et al. PMID: 33745227). Plasma membrane recycling of the dopamine transporter is mediated by retromer (Wu et al., PMID: 28847807) and impaired in Vps35 p.Asp620Asn knock-in mice (Cataldi et al., PMID: 30155515). The neuropathology observed in aged knock-in mice remains controversial as tauopathy (Chen et al., PMID: 30842285) or alpha-synucleinopathy (Niu et al. PMID: 33745227) are reported by different investigators in an identical strain. In summary, VPS35 definitively causes autosomal-dominant Parkinson's disease. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5143c1e9-ed02-48f2-95cf-bf4229767fb8","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b0e546d6-8a44-4e9d-83aa-f781ec4ec166","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b0e546d6-8a44-4e9d-83aa-f781ec4ec166_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10079","date":"2021-11-03T13:45:30.189Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b0e546d6-8a44-4e9d-83aa-f781ec4ec166_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10079","date":"2021-11-03T13:45:17.796Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b0e546d6-8a44-4e9d-83aa-f781ec4ec166_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b0e546d6-8a44-4e9d-83aa-f781ec4ec166_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a89c0bd8-b438-4d21-9746-41f8a7d18409","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ece2337d-3188-4223-946c-459fdb5ffa70","type":"Finding","dc:description":"characteristic loss of dopaminergic (TH-positive) neurons","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25288323","rdfs:label":"Drosophila expressing mutant VPS35","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/480f05a3-f461-4037-922d-e8005cba2744","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bc3295b8-4f36-45ff-9a18-b1427064ff14","type":"Finding","dc:description":"The D620N VPS35 knockin (KI) mouse model of PD formally established the age-related pathogenic effects of the D620N mutation at physiological expression levels.

NimbleGen Sequence Capture Arrays were used for isolating the genomic coding regions to be sequenced. The NimbleGen Arrays, which contain 2.1 million probes that capture ~180,000 exons and ~550 miRNA, were used for interrogation of genomic regions from CH III-2 and III-13. Sequencing was subsequently performed on an Illumina Genome Analyzer by 76 bp paired-end reads. The mean coverage per targeted base was 51.6-fold for III-2 and 43.8-fold for III-13, and 73.2% and 60.7% of bases, respectively, had R20-fold coverage. The percentage of targeted bases covered was 98.5% and 97.0% for III-2 and III-13, respectively. Adaptor sequences from reads were filtered via a local dynamic programming algorithm. Reads with more than 12 bp of overlap with adaptor sequences were deemed contaminated and removed; only those reads of 30 bp or longer were used for further analysis. Reads with more than six missing bases or 40 consecutive identical bases were omitted from further processing. The remaining sequences were aligned to a reference sequence (Hg18, build 36.1) with SOAPaligner (parameters -a -D -o -r 1 -t -c -f 4), followed by SOAPsnp so that consensus and call genotypes (parameters -i -d -o -r 0.00005 -e 0.0001 -M -t -u -L -s \u00012 -T) could be assembled. Validation of common SNP genotypes was conducted against dbSNP v129. Structural variations were determined by the paired-end method and clustering algo- rithm alignment against CNVs in the Database of Genomic Variants v6 (November 2008). This analysis identified a total of 34,754 and 29,952 variants for III-2 and III-13, respectively. Assuming these two family members have the same genetic cause of disease reduced the number of variants to 17,872 common to both individuals. On the basis of the genotypes of eight publicly available HapMap samples,6 additional polymorphisms were excluded, leaving 4,256 novel vari- ants. After variants on the X chromosome and homozygous changes (autosomal-dominant inheritance of disease was assumed), noncoding variants, synonymous changes, and variants present in dbSNP v130 were excluded, only 69 variants remained.\nWe recognize that next-generation capture and sequencing methods are limited in coverage and that some bioinformatics results might be erroneous. Thus, we used Sanger sequencing of these novel variants in one sample used for NGS (III-2), two additional affected family members (III-6 and III-9), and one unaf- fected spouse (II-2) to assess the accuracy of NGS genotype calls and segregation with disease. Thirty-six variants were an artifact; they could not be confirmed by Sanger sequencing and appeared to be a consequence of mis- aligned repeat sequences.

Both variants are on the same chromosomal region 16p12.1-q12.1 haplotype and were found in all affected family members and one unaffected family member (III-3). Additional support for variants in chromosomal region 16p12.1-q12.1 is provided by linkage data.","firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/276fe67d-8110-4353-9457-a108db343411_variant_evidence_item"}}},"meetsInclusionCriteria":true,"phenotypePositiveAllelePositive":9,"proband":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1f6590a5-fdbe-4ff1-b1fd-c23024d67854"},"sequencingMethod":{"id":"cg:AllGenesSequencing"}},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bad98342-4551-4520-8816-449a34acfe42_proband_segregation","type":"FamilyCosegregation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21763483","rdfs:label":"Family A","estimatedLodScore":4.21,"family":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bad98342-4551-4520-8816-449a34acfe42","type":"Family","rdfs:label":"Family A","member":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/990597b0-9524-498c-9a0f-432e13860bdb","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21763483","rdfs:label":"3017","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":48,"allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/29c38364-44e0-450c-a130-8dec094286ee"},"detectionMethod":"To identify the disease-causing variant, they selected two second cousins (#3017 and #3020) for exome sequencing.

Selecting distantly related members of the pedigree should minimize the proportion of alleles shared by descent. Exome sequencing was performed on a Genome Analyzer IIx system (Illumina) after in-solution enrichment of exonic sequences (SureSelect Human All Exon 38 Mb kit, Agilent). They sequenced two lanes of a flowcell for both samples, each as 54 bp paired-end runs. Read alignment was performed with BWA (version 0.5.8) to the human genome assembly hg19. Single-nucleotide variants and small insertions and deletions (indels) were detected with SAMtools (v 0.1.7). They filtered called variants to exclude those present in 72 control exomes from patients with other unrelated diseases. They further excluded all variants that were present in dbSNP 131 and had an average heterozygosity of more than 0.02. Variant annotation was performed with custom scripts. This approach left ten heterozygous nonsynonymous variants shared by both affected individuals.","firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0002063","obo:HP_0002067","obo:HP_0002172"],"sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fc62b8b1-7c2d-4e8a-8aa4-8c32f87c37fd_variant_evidence_item"}}},"meetsInclusionCriteria":true,"phenotypePositiveAllelePositive":7,"phenotypes":["obo:HP_0002067","obo:HP_0002322","obo:HP_0002063","obo:HP_0002172"],"proband":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/990597b0-9524-498c-9a0f-432e13860bdb"},"sequencingMethod":{"id":"cg:AllGenesSequencing"}},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fbbdb729-ad32-4de2-b673-6478e8fbe785_proband_segregation","type":"FamilyCosegregation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21763482","rdfs:label":"US-1","estimatedLodScore":0.3,"family":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fbbdb729-ad32-4de2-b673-6478e8fbe785","type":"Family","rdfs:label":"US-1","member":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/529bb653-bd53-484b-beec-2827a24d70d6","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21763482","rdfs:label":"US-1-sister","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":64,"allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/29c38364-44e0-450c-a130-8dec094286ee"},"detectionMethod":"A combination of Sequenom MassArray iPLEX (San Diego, CA) and TaqMan probes was used for genotyping, and all mutations were confirmed by direct sequencing.","firstTestingMethod":"Genotyping","previousTesting":false,"sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bb8bc4c9-4369-4aa4-94ac-87e880123674_variant_evidence_item"}}},"meetsInclusionCriteria":false,"phenotypePositiveAllelePositive":2,"proband":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/529bb653-bd53-484b-beec-2827a24d70d6"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValiditySegregationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":3},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2f89c14f-549f-4d93-aa1d-639cfa094d02","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2f89c14f-549f-4d93-aa1d-639cfa094d02_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"Multiple lines of functional data.
