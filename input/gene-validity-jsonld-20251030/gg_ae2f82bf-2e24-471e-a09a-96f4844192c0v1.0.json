The specific disease entity, primary ciliary dyskinesia 10 (MONDO:0012918, OMIM:612518), is one of at least 45 different primary ciliary dyskinesias distinguished by a single monogenic cause. Some of the most common patient phenotypes are: bronchiectasis, recurrent pneumonia, chronic sinusitis, chronic otitis media, situs inversus totalis, male or female infertility, and immotile cilia. Absent or defective outer dynein arms (ODAs) and inner dynein arms (IDAs) have been observed in respiratory cilia and spermatozoa. The patients evaluated in this curation have onset as early as at birth.\n\nThis curation includes six variants (three missense, two frameshift and one nonsense) that have been reported in five probands in three publications (PMIDs: 32638265,19052621, 34785929). Four of the probands were homozygous, with two confirmed to have consanguineous parents, while one proband was compound heterozygous with confirmation of carrier status in the parents.\n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by multiple forms of experimental evidence, including the biochemical function of the gene product, its protein interactions and expression pattern, and animal models (PMIDs: 32638265, 31107948, 19052621, 33635866, 23525783, 23715323, 29358401). *DNAAF2* encodes a factor involved in preassembly of dynein arm complexes, and physically interacts with SPAG1 and HEATR2/DNAAF5, two other dynein assembly factors known to harbor variants causing PCD (PMID: 29358401). High levels of expression of *DNAAF2* were found in multiciliated human tissues associated with PCD, particularly the fallopian tubes, lungs, and testes (PMID: 23715323, PMID:31107948). A *Dnaaf2* knockout mouse model showed abnormal development with reversed laterality (e.g. heart looping), demonstrating that DNAAF2 function is necessary for the establishment of correct left–right patterning of abdominal organs during embryo formation (PMID: 31107948). A second mouse model showed situs inversus totalis, abnormal ciliary motility, and absent inner and outer dynein arms, as well as hydrocephalus (PMID: 23525783). A Medaka fish model showed an organ laterality defect, male infertility, abnormal ciliary motility, and absent ODAs and IDAs (PMID: 19052621). A transformation-generated mutant in *pf13*, the *Chlamydomonas* orthologue of *DNAAF2*, showed absent inner and outer dynein arms and static flagella, which could be rescued by wild-type gene.\n\nIn conclusion, *DNAAF2* is definitively associated with primary ciliary dyskinesia 10. This classification has been clearly demonstrated and confirmed through both experimental and genetic evidence and has been upheld over time without the emergence of conflicting evidence. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Motile Ciliopathy GCEP on February 8th, 2024 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ae2f82bf-2e24-471e-a09a-96f4844192c0","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/39e5de96-3f16-4dde-a7bc-b3e27364b7f8","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/39e5de96-3f16-4dde-a7bc-b3e27364b7f8_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10102","date":"2024-04-06T02:23:29.606Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/39e5de96-3f16-4dde-a7bc-b3e27364b7f8_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10102","date":"2024-02-08T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/39e5de96-3f16-4dde-a7bc-b3e27364b7f8_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d1de9ec9-ea15-4223-ba5b-2ed18ec166de_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ba224789-bbcf-460b-b80c-1cffde71bf81","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Downscored due to homozygosity, consanguinity and lack of through testing methods.","calculatedScore":4,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ba224789-bbcf-460b-b80c-1cffde71bf81_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"In Western blots of cell lysates from control respiratory cells, an anti-KTU antibody detects a specific band at ~95kDa, compatible with the size of the predicted 837 amino acid KTU protein encoded by all three exons (Fig. 2c).","functionalDataSupport":"Yes"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ba224789-bbcf-460b-b80c-1cffde71bf81_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19052621","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0426e31c-cc65-4f2d-be47-053e8c4cd572","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_018139.3(DNAAF2):c.23C>A (p.Ser8Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA251489"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":1.0},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d1de9ec9-ea15-4223-ba5b-2ed18ec166de","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19052621","rdfs:label":"OP-234 II1","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0426e31c-cc65-4f2d-be47-053e8c4cd572"},"detectionMethod":"\"We correlated the findings of the HVMA with a diverse set of genetic PCD variants using Sisson-Ammons Video Analysis (SAVA).\"","phenotypeFreeText":"Consanguineous family.
