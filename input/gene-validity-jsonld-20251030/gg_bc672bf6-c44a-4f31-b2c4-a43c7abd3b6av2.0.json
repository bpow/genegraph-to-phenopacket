At least six variants (e.g. missense, in-frame indel) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, limited segregation data, and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least nine probands in seven publications (PMIDs: 26257172, 27009151, 30249361, 31412900, 26828946, 32277537, 37238449). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in several additional family members, including a large multi-generational family (37238449). There is variant level experimental evidence to support pathogenicity of 6 of the reported variants (PMID: 28747762, 34138518). In total, genetic evidence totals 4.5 points. \n\nThe mechanism for disease is suspected to be a monoallelic gain-of-function or dominant negative effect with variants affecting the myelin structure or causing upregulation of the protein (PMID: 28747762). This gene-disease association is additionally supported by PMP2's function in lipid homeostasis and remyelination, as well as functional evidence in PMP2 null mice. Expression of PMP2 in myelin, interacting with MPZ, a protein also associated with demyelinating CMT, also provides evidence towards its pathogenicity. A transgenic mouse model expressing the I43N variant does recapitulate many of the phenotypes observed in humans. However, the possibility for interference via overexpression, rather than from the variant itself, requires more clarification in future studies. In total, experimental evidence totals 2.5.\n\nIn summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship with a total of 7 points. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged.\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bc672bf6-c44a-4f31-b2c4-a43c7abd3b6a","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/aa4c5730-f807-45d7-afe7-573a3960916f","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","changes":[{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},{"id":"cg:sopChange"},{"id":"cg:newEvidence"},{"id":"cg:classificationChange"},{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/aa4c5730-f807-45d7-afe7-573a3960916f_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10063","date":"2025-05-29T15:56:03.086Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/aa4c5730-f807-45d7-afe7-573a3960916f_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10063","date":"2025-05-29T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["RecurationNewEvidence","RecurationCommunityRequest"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/aa4c5730-f807-45d7-afe7-573a3960916f_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/061c49b9-db88-4ad4-ab00-40a0f9c8eee2","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/061c49b9-db88-4ad4-ab00-40a0f9c8eee2_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26257172","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1e790a18-8750-4fa4-8600-22738b998442","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_002677.5(PMP2):c.128T>A (p.Ile43Asn)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA10584083"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Heterozygous"}},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/061c49b9-db88-4ad4-ab00-40a0f9c8eee2_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"\"The altered stability, dynamics, and fatty acid/lipid membrane binding of the disease-associated P2 protein variants may be involved in CMT1 etiology and give rise to myelin defects, including abnormal myelin compaction and irregular myelin sheaths, in P2-linked CMT1 patients.\" PMID: 28747762","functionalDataSupport":"Yes"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/57a2e389-ac7f-46b1-846c-a5e1348abf22","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/57a2e389-ac7f-46b1-846c-a5e1348abf22_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27009151","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/628ef9ac-f079-4a9f-97ee-9df272a10a7b","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_002677.5(PMP2):c.155T>C (p.Ile52Thr)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/599406"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Heterozygous"}},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/57a2e389-ac7f-46b1-846c-a5e1348abf22_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"\"The altered stability, dynamics, and fatty acid/lipid membrane binding of the disease-associated P2 protein variants may be involved in CMT1 etiology and give rise to myelin defects, including abnormal myelin compaction and irregular myelin sheaths, in P2-linked CMT1 patients.\" PMID: 28747762","functionalDataSupport":"Yes"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7338e352-6425-444d-9208-bbbeb27cbe96","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7338e352-6425-444d-9208-bbbeb27cbe96_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31412900","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/885cf0d5-3f94-4748-87dd-a0285bfbde7b","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_002677.5(PMP2):c.344T>C (p.Val115Ala)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA371516958"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Heterozygous"}},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7338e352-6425-444d-9208-bbbeb27cbe96_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"“Our data indicate similar properties for all known human P2 CMT variants;
