Around the same period, linkage analysis and homozygosity mapping of families with ataxia with oculomotor apraxia mapped the AOA2 locus to the same genomic region (Nemeth et al, 2000, PMID: 11022012; Bomont et al, 2000, PMID: 11175288).\nTesting of additional families allowed the identification of the human ortholog of yeast Sen1p, SETX, as the causative gene in patients with the recessive form of ataxia with oculomotor apraxia type 2 (AOA2) and the dominant juvenile form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis type 4 (ALS4) (Moreira et al, 2004, PMID: 14770181; Chen et al, 2004, PMID: 15106121).\nPer criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found differences in inheritance pattern, clinical presentation, as well as molecular mechanism. Therefore, the disease entities have been split into Distal hereditary motor neuropathy with pyramidal features aka ALS4  (OMIM: 602433) and Spinocerebellar ataxia with axonal neuropathy aka AOA2 (OMIM: 606002) and will be assessed separately.\nPatients with ALS4 present during childhood or adolescence, with distal muscle weakness and atrophy, pyramidal signs. They exhibit a combination of upper and lower motor neuron degeneration; respiratory musculature is usually spared, with no bulbar involvement, slow progression and normal life expectancy in most reported patients.\nAlthough the gene is very polymorphic, only few well established causative missense variants were reported in patients with ALS4. Some of these variants segregated within families (Chen et al., 2004, PMID: 15106121; De Jonghe  et al, 2002, PMID: 12023320; Drew et al, 2015, PMID: 25802885; Ma et al, 2018, PMID: 30052327; Avemaria et al, 2011, PMID: 2143876; Rudnik-Schöneborn et al, 2012, PMID: 22088787; Grunseich et al, 2020, PMID: 31957062); while others were sporadic (Saiga et al, 2012, PMID: 2257723; Grunseich et al, 2020, PMID: 31957062;  Hadjinicolaou et al, 2021, PMID: 34922620).\nThe gene-disease association is also supported by experimental evidence. Two mouse models were generated, a transgenic mouse (PrP-SETX-R2136H) and a knock-in mouse (Setx-L389S). The mutant mice displayed motor neuron degeneration and neuron toxicity with no detectable evidence for sensory abnormalities and key ALS features of TDP-43 nuclear clearance and cytosolic mislocalization. These findings were consistent with ALS4 patient pathology (Bennett et al, 2018, PMID: 29725819).\nThe mechanism of pathogenicity is reported to be gain-of-function.  By altering R-loop levels, the senataxin mutation in ALS4 leads to disruption of transcription and abnormal TGFβ signaling as shown in patient derived cells (Grunseich et al, 2018, PMID: 29395064; Grunseich et al, 2020, PMID: 31957062).\nIn summary, there is [definitive evidence/Strong evidence] to support the relationship between SETX and [distal hereditary neuropathy/ALS4]. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/18064f5b-dc46-403e-aecf-8590b6e7c88c","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1f355b8f-1cd9-401c-8f34-b9b3e2fe939b","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1f355b8f-1cd9-401c-8f34-b9b3e2fe939b_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10063","date":"2022-08-03T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1f355b8f-1cd9-401c-8f34-b9b3e2fe939b_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10063","date":"2022-08-03T14:49:16.505Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1f355b8f-1cd9-401c-8f34-b9b3e2fe939b_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1f355b8f-1cd9-401c-8f34-b9b3e2fe939b_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f6654b5c-c6c9-4f57-92ca-5dec6a73e70c","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a2185814-94bc-4f00-92bc-469415fd5ba7","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Transgenic SETX mice developed motor phenotypes and motor neuron degeneration, and exhibit neurotoxicity.
