{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/706b4004-0e59-4aa4-a7a3-a4bafc0ca499v1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"*UCHL1* was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive spastic paraplegia in 2013 (Bilguvar et al., PMID: 23359680). This condition is characterized by spastic paraplegia, vision issues, ataxia, brain atrophy, neuropathy, and abnormal reflexes. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting guidelines, we found key differences in inheritance pattern, molecular mechanism, and phenotypic variability. Therefore, the following disease entities have been split into two: autosomal recessive spastic paraplegia (OMIM:615491) and autosomal dominant spastic paraplegia (OMIM:620221). The split curation for autosomal dominant spastic paraplegia has been evaluated separately. \n\nFive variants (missense, in-frame deletion, splicing) that have been reported in ten probands in four publications (PMIDs: 23359680, 28007905, 29735986, 32656641) are included in this curation. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence (expression-level evidence, functional alteration evidence, and mouse models). Expression-level data shows that the gene is strongly expressed in the brain and spinal cord (PMID: 11555633). Functional alteration evidence demonstrated that *UCHL1* is key for synaptic function in the brain (PMID: 16923396). Two mouse models demonstrated that *UCHL1* mutants have low body weight, neurodegeneration, abnormal brain and spinal cord morphology, dysphagia, and early lethality (PMIDs: 11555633, 3340629) . \n\nIn summary, there is moderate evidence supporting the relationship between *UCHL1* and autosomal recessive spastic paraplegia. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Cerebral Palsy GCEP on the meeting date May 19, 2025 (SOP Version 11).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/706b4004-0e59-4aa4-a7a3-a4bafc0ca499","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a297cb2b-e4ea-4fd9-8266-611963988941","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a297cb2b-e4ea-4fd9-8266-611963988941_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10113","date":"2025-08-06T17:27:24.906Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a297cb2b-e4ea-4fd9-8266-611963988941_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10113","date":"2025-05-19T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"The total score should be 7.7 pts., due to discrepancy in scoring one genetic evidence case.
