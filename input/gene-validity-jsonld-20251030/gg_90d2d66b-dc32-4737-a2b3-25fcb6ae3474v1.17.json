Therefore, this curation concerns the relationship between *NRXN1* and autosomal dominant complex neurodevelopmental disorder. The first *NRXN1* deletion was reported by the Autism Genome Project Consortium in 2007 (PMID: 17322880). At least 118 pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants have been reported in ClinVar, including deletions, intragenic duplications, and sequence variants. Because the copy number changes included in this curation are larger than 10 kb, they could not be entered into the Gene Curation Interface. Thus, the genetic evidence is summarized below.\n\n- Zahir et al. (2008, PMID: 18057082) reported a 12 yo male proband with ID, autistic features, and severe language and motor impairments; this individual had a heterozygous *de novo* deletion of ~320 kb in *NRXN1* (chr2:50,799,281-51,120,644, hg18), and was given 2 points.\n\n- Agha et al. (2008, PMID: 26438105) reported a 28 yo female proband with developmental delay, language delay, ID, and impaired social interactions, carrying a heterozygous *de novo* deletion of ~455 kb overlapping *NRXN1* (chr2:51,020,477-51,476,031, hg19); this individual was given 1.5 points, as the effect of this variant on protein function was not clear. \n\n- Wisniowiecka-Kowalnik et al. (2010, PMID: 20162629) reported three families, two of which were scored. Family 1 received a score of 1.5 points for a ~380 kb deletion in *NRXN1* that was observed in all five affected members (chr2:50,034,351-50,413,346, hg18). Family 2 also received a score of 1.5 points for an inherited intragenic tandem duplication, found in all three affected individuals (chr2:50,011,487-50,195,746, hg18).\n\n- Gregor et al. (2011, PMID: 21827697) reported six individuals with *NRXN1* deletions, four of which were scored and given 0.5 points each (N1: chr2:50,806,393-51,208,000, hg18, paternal; N2: chr2:50,270,203-51,357,206, hg17, maternal; N5: chr2:50,861,527-51,090,563, hg17, paternal; N6: chr2:51,033,865-51,496,143, hg17, *de novo*).\n\n- Ching et al. (2010, PMID: 20468056) reported 12 individuals, eight of which were scored. Patient 2 received a full score of 2 points for a 3.9 Mb *de novo* deletion (chr2:50,128,256-54,050,713, hg18). Patient 3 received a downgraded score of 0.1 point for a 315 kb deletion (chr2:50,897,002-51,212,385, hg18) in light of a very mild neurodevelopmental phenotype. Patients 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9 all received scores of 0.5. Patients 4, 6, 7, and 9 all had inherited deletions (chr2:50,936,914-51,167,934; chr2:51,059,410-51,316,396; chr2:51,090,504-51,212,385; chr2:50,689,280-50,853,329, hg18), while patient 5 had a *de novo* deletion (chr2:50,920,082-51,059,469, hg18), but was downgraded due to a mild phenotype. The deletion in patient 10 (chr2:50,714,927-50,853,329, hg18) only impacted intronic regions and was given a score of 0, since only exonic *NRXN1* variants are known to be pathogenic. \n\nIn total, 13.1 points were awarded for genetic evidence. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached.\n\nNeurexins are presynaptic cell adhesion molecules that bind to postsynaptic ligands, such as neuroligins. They mediate signaling across the synapse and shape the properties of neural circuits by specifying synaptic functions. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence, including mouse and stem cell models. \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *NRXN1* and autosomal dominant complex neurodevelopmental disorder. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel on July 10, 2019 (SOP Version 6).  ","Variants in NRXN1 have been associated with a variety of different neurodevelopmental conditions, including intellectual disability, epilepsy, and autism spectrum disorder. At least 118 pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants have been reported in ClinVar (most being deletions, SNVs, or duplications), with the first reported NRXN1 deletion observed by The Autism Genome Project Consortium in 2007 (PMID: 17322880). Here, we report several cases that have led to a definitive classification between the curated disease entity, complex neurodevelopmental disorder (MONDO:0100038), and NRXN1. \n\nZahir et al., 2008 (PMID: 18057082) report a 12yo male proband with ID, autistic features, and severe language and motor impairments; this individual had a heterozygous de novo deletion of ~320kb in NRXN1 (chr2:50,799,281-51,120,644 (hg18)), and was given 2 points. Another case report from Zehra et al., 2008 (PMID: 26438105) presented a 28yo female proband with ID, developmental delay, language delay, and impaired social interactions (heterozygous de novo deletion of ~455 kb (chr2:51,020,477-51,476,031 (hg19)) – this individual was given 1.5 points, as the effect of this variant on protein function was not clear. \n\nA family study by Wisniowiecka-Kowalnik et al., 2010 (PMID: 20162629) outlined three families (only two scored). Family 1 received a score of 1.5 points for an ~380 kb deletion in NRXN1 that was observed in all five affected members (chr2:50,034,351-50,413,346 (hg18)). Family 2 also received a score of 1.5 points for an inherited tandem duplication, found in all three affected individuals (chr2:50,011,487-50,195,746 (hg18)).\n\nTwo final studies were assessed, both of which presented a number of unrelated individuals. In a paper from Gregor et al., 2011 (PMID: 21827697), four probands were scored (N1, N2, N5, and N6). All four were given defaults scores of 0.5 points for their NRXN1 deletions (chr2:50,806,393-51,208,000 (hg18); chr2:50,270,203-51,357,206 (hg17); chr2:50,861,527-51,090,563 (hg17); chr2:51,033,865-51,496,143 (hg17)). Finally, Ching et al., 2010 (PMID: 20468056) present twelve individuals, eight of which were scored. Patient 2 received a full score of 2 points for a 3923kb de novo deletion (chr2:50,128,256-54,050,713 (hg18)). Patient 3 received a downgraded score of 0.1 point for a 315kb deletion chr2:50,897,002-51,212,385 (hg18)) in light of a very mild neurodevelopmental disorder phenotype. Patients 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9 all received scores of 0.5. Patients 4, 6, 7, and 9 all had inherited deletions (chr2:50,936,914-51,167,934; chr2:51,059,410-51,316,396; chr2: 51,090,504-51,212,385; chr2:50,689,280-50,853,329 (hg18)), while patient 5 had a de novo deletion (chr2:50,920,082-51,059,469 (hg18)), but was downgraded due to a mild phenotype. The variant observed in patient 10 (chr2:50,714,927-50,853,329 (hg18)) only impacted intronic regions and was given a score of zero since at this time, only exonic NRXN1 variants are known to be pathogenic.. \n\nIn total, 13.1 points were awarded for genetic evidence (note that more evidence is available, but not assessed given that this is above the 12 point cut-off), and 4 points for experimental evidence (max allowed for non-human model organisms), bringing the NRXN1-complex NDD classification into the definitive range (replicated over time) – 16 points."],"dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/90d2d66b-dc32-4737-a2b3-25fcb6ae3474","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/14bb833a-eefd-4f02-b112-c74b6866d5be","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","changes":{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/14bb833a-eefd-4f02-b112-c74b6866d5be_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2025-09-19T10:18:19.118Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/14bb833a-eefd-4f02-b112-c74b6866d5be_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":["2019-07-10T16:00:00.000Z","2019-07-10T10:00:00.000Z"],"role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"Due to the size of the deletions observed (>10kb), unable to enter variants on Gene Curation Interface (preventing ability to score).
