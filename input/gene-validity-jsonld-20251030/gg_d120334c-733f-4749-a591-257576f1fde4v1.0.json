At least 38 unique variants (mostly nonsense and frameshift) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 15 probands in 3 publications (PMIDs: 9546392, 15876275, 9546392). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 3 additional family members. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence has been reached. The mechanism or disease is homozygous loss of function. This gene disease association is supported by its biochemical function as a cargo receptor for the ER-to-Golgi transport of factor V and factor VIII (PMID: 10551804), its interaction with MCFD2 (PMID: 15886209) which is also implicated in this disease, and a knockout mouse model (PMID: 21795745) that also exhibits reductions of both factor V and factor VIII. In summary, LMAN1 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive inheritance of factor V and factor VIII, combined deficiency. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d120334c-733f-4749-a591-257576f1fde4","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/31792b8d-aca4-4832-b7f7-1993611777d7","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/31792b8d-aca4-4832-b7f7-1993611777d7_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2019-11-27T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/31792b8d-aca4-4832-b7f7-1993611777d7_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/31792b8d-aca4-4832-b7f7-1993611777d7_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3dd62137-32ed-4390-8528-714b314114b2_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The paternally inherited c.823-1G>C splice variant disrupts the acceptor site of exon 8, the predicted out of frame deletion of exon 8 would result in a premature stop codon in exon 9.
