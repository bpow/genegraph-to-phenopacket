The TRMU gene encodes the tRNA 5-methylaminomethyl-2-thiouridylate methyltransferase, a mitochondrion-specific tRNA-modifying enzyme.\n\nThe TRMU gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Leigh syndrome spectrum in 2014 (PMID: 25058219). Of note, many individuals with TRMU-related disease have so-called “reversible” infantile liver failure without features of Leigh syndrome spectrum.\n\nEvidence supporting the gene-disease relationship between TRMU and Leigh syndrome spectrum includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included five variants identified in three cases in two publications (PMID: 25058219, 33365252). No segregation data were available. Loss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease association is also supported by biochemical function and animal models (PMIDs: 29980628, 27689697).  \n\nIn summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on December 16, 2020 (SOP Version 7).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7f699d06-b28d-4bb6-abb8-d365f6d8b4ae","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d1d9d958-be13-4018-ab9c-305788171d1e","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d1d9d958-be13-4018-ab9c-305788171d1e_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2021-01-21T00:47:55.799Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d1d9d958-be13-4018-ab9c-305788171d1e_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2021-01-21T00:48:07.402Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":" \n","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d1d9d958-be13-4018-ab9c-305788171d1e_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/22e40a8c-6ab2-4cf5-8dc0-4f5b13f6adc0_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"NMD expected for frameshift variant ","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/47297d6e-7bf7-4f00-b1b1-a9f9932b94ba","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33365252","rdfs:label":"Patient 1","ageType":"AgeAtDeath","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":6,"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"A female proband diagnosed with Leigh syndrome.
