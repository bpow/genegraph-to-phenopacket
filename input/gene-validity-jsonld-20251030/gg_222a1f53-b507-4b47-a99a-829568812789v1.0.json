ALS-linked variants operate by altering the overall hGle1 levels and/or shifting the subcellular pools of its two isoforms, hGle1B versus hGle1A. At least 7 rare variants have been reported in relation to ALS (including splicing, missense, and nonsense variants) from 7 probands in 2 publications (PMIDs: 25343993, 34025336). Experimentally, this gene-disease relationship is supported by its function at the nuclear pore complex (PMID: 9618489) and in stress granule assembly/disassembly (PMID: 25694449), two process that have been linked to ALS. In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged.\n\nOf note, *GLE1* is also Congenital arthrogryposis with anterior horn cell disease (OMIM # 611890) and Lethal congenital contracture syndrome 1 (OMIM# 253310). Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found differences in the molecular mechanism, phenotype, and inheritance pattern for ALS and thus curated it separately from the additional disease entities.
