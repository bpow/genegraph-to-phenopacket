{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2c29334c-3292-46f6-98d6-da56cd4137dbv1.2","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"The *NYX* gene was first reported in relation to X-linked cases of congenital stationary night blindness by two groups in the year 2000 (PMID: 11062471, PMID: 11062472). Affected male patients have since been identified in a number of other publications (PMID: 14609846, PMID: 18617546), with causal monoallelic variants in *NYX* specifically diagnostic for congenital stationary night blindness type 1A. This disease entity is referred to in this curation as *NYX*-related congenital stationary night blindness, and represents one of two X-linked forms of congenital stationary night blindness distinguished by a single monogenic cause. The disease is sometimes referred to as complete (as opposed to incomplete) X-linked congenital stationary night blindness based on the relative severity of its electroretinogram findings. The disease appears to be fully penetrant, with patients often presenting in infancy or early childhood with ocular features of night blindness, myopia, and reduced (but non-progressive) visual acuity, as well as nystagmus in some cases. Severely reduced or absent scotopic b-wave (electronegative ERG) is a characteristic finding on ERG, while the absence of oscillatory-potential wavelets and the presence of other rod ERG abnormalities are often reported as well. Because of the broad spectrum of potential phenotypes, these cases with causal variants in *NYX* have been curated under the inclusive disease name *NYX*-related retinopathy (MONDO:0800407).\n\nTen suspected pathogenic variants were scored as part of this curation (three nonsense, two frameshift, two missense, two small in-frame deletions, and one disrupting splicing), which have been collectively reported in ten probands in four publications (PMID: 11062471, PMID: 11062472, PMID: 18617546, PMID: 14609846). All probands were males who were hemizygous for their respective variants, and none were reported to have consanguineous parents. Heterozygous females are generally unaffected, following X-linked recessive inheritance. One family was scored for segregation evidence (PMID: 11062471). Additional available pieces of segregation evidence (PMID: 11062472, PMID: 16670814) and case-level evidence (PMID: 11062471, PMID: 11062472, PMID: 16670814, PMID: 12397430) were not scored as part of this curation as the maximum scoring for these evidence types had already been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be monoallelic loss-of-function, characterized in some cases by frameshift or nonsense variants predicted to disrupt the C-terminal glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor of the protein product. This loss has been shown to trigger NYX retention and accumulation in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi rather than proper localization to the cell surface (PMID: 14507859).\n\nThis gene-disease association is also supported by experimental evidence that *NYX* exhibits its highest expression levels in retina tissue (PMID: 30239781), including in the inner segment of photoreceptors, inner and outer nuclear layers, and ganglion cell layer (PMID: 11062471). Staining evidence from zebrafish retinas shows *nyx* expression specifically in the outer plexiform and inner plexiform layers, strongly co-localizing with post-synaptic but not pre-synaptic markers (PMID: 17004930). Zebrafish with *nyx* knockdown exhibit absence of scotopic b-wave and normal a-wave in ERG recordings as well as reduced visual contrast sensitivity (PMID: 17004930). A naturally occurring mouse model with absence of scotopic b-wave and normal a-wave in ERG recordings as well as reduced visual acuity and X-linked inheritance has been found to harbor a frameshift mutation in *Nyx* disrupting the majority of the protein product (PMID:1250699). Tissue-specific *Nyx* transgene expression in the dendritic tips of retinal depolarizing bipolar cells in this mouse model strongly rescues both the ERG phenotype and the light-evoked responses of retinal ganglion cells (PMID: 17881478). Although the exact function of Nyx has not been conclusively demonstrated, these results collectively argue that it plays a critical role in the retinal bipolar cells that synapse with rod photoreceptor cells and transmit signals to ganglion cells.\n\nIn summary, *NYX* is definitively associated with *NYX*-related retinopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both research and diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time without the emergence of contradictory evidence, leading to a Definitive classification. This classification has been approved by the ClinGen Retina GCEP on March 3rd, 2022 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2c29334c-3292-46f6-98d6-da56cd4137db","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c48083c5-2ef8-45ee-a97f-dc973d5d5072","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c48083c5-2ef8-45ee-a97f-dc973d5d5072_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10072","date":"2023-07-03T18:51:49.181Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c48083c5-2ef8-45ee-a97f-dc973d5d5072_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10072","date":"2022-03-03T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c48083c5-2ef8-45ee-a97f-dc973d5d5072_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5d3a6267-d86d-4290-95ec-3abe63606031","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"NM_022567.2(NYX):c.1122_*11del (p.Ser374ArgfsTer10) is a frameshift variant in exon 3/3 that is not predicted to trigger NMD but disrupts the C-terminal 22% of the protein product.

Lack of co-localization between Nyx and either SV2 or PSD-95 (two presynaptic markers) confirmed that Nyx is specifically post-synaptically localized (Figs. 5C, 6A). This was further confirmed by the detection of Nyx-labeled second-order neuron dendrites invaginating into presynaptic cone pedicles (Figs. 6B and 6C). This data indicates that the role of NYX is post-synaptic rather than pre-synaptic, and is highly compatible with the findings of a separate mouse experiment (PMID: 17881478) showing that Nyx transgene expression in the dendritic tips of retinal depolarizing bipolar cells rescues the phenotype of Nyx-deficient mice.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17004930","rdfs:label":"Nyx localization to both synaptic layers of zebrafish retina","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cfe4d1f7-e526-47bc-9950-3b182281938c","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"This expression pattern has been scored due to its compatibility with the visual phenotypes of the affected patients.","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d496ad4b-4836-4314-b292-55614d120f14","type":"Finding","dc:description":"RNA-seq data from EyeIntegration v1.05 (PMID: 30239781) indicate that NYX exhibits its highest expression levels in retina tissue, particularly retinal pigmented epithelium.
