The NDUFA9 gene encodes the NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) subunit A9, a non-catalytic complex I accessory protein required for complex I assembly and function within the mitochondria. Defects of this protein lead to complex I deficiency.\n\nThe NDUFA9 gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Leigh syndrome spectrum in 2012 (PMID: 22114105). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data.\n\nThis curation included two unique variants identified in two cases from two publications (PMIDs: 22114105, 28671271). No segregation data were available. Loss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease association is also supported by known protein interactions, expression data, and functional alterations observed in patient cells and in non-patient cells (PMIDs: 25613900, 28671271, 23223238, 27509854).\n\nIn summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. No convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on August 21, 2019 (SOP Version 7).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0d19b627-fdec-4b78-82e0-ba4723875a83","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/87c6c5c5-7bf7-4bd2-94f0-2d529a512e74","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/87c6c5c5-7bf7-4bd2-94f0-2d529a512e74_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/87c6c5c5-7bf7-4bd2-94f0-2d529a512e74_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2019-11-25T16:28:51.567Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/87c6c5c5-7bf7-4bd2-94f0-2d529a512e74_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/87c6c5c5-7bf7-4bd2-94f0-2d529a512e74_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f2a135ee-5eb4-4a4f-ab68-4f16d85b6494","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"In patient fibroblasts, the c.962G>C (p.Arg321Pro) is asociated with complex I deficiency related to defective assembly of the complex I holoenzyme.","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bcee5b8c-45fd-458a-b77e-43358b1f01a1","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Analysis of mitochondrial protein from control and patient 2 ( case report 22114105: van den Bosch et al. 2011, see case data) derived fibroblasts using 2D non denaturing PAGE and immunoblot showed reduced complex I holoenzyme levels, accumulation of Q module assembly intermediates, detected using NDUFS3 (Fig 2 D) and accumulation of P module assembly units (NDA and NDUFB11).","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28671271","rdfs:label":"Patient fibroblasts"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d11ebfa3-3b41-4f40-b1f0-3fc563574c09","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"NDUFA9 is a complex I subunit required for complex I assembly and complex I activity.
