While various names have been given to the constellation of features seen in those with *NUBPL*-related disorders, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the NUBPL phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework. Of note, *NUBPL* was first curated by this Expert Panel for its association with Leigh syndrome spectrum (LSS) on February 26, 2020 (SOP V7), with a final classification of Moderate. This current curation for the association with primary mitochondrial disease includes the cases included in the LSS curation.\n\nEvidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included nine variants (four missense, two frameshift, two splice, one complex rearrangement) in seven probands from five publications (PMIDs: 22826544, 30897263, 3191710, 20818383, 23553477). There are additional cases reported in the medical literature; however, these were not included in this curation as the maximum genetic evidence score was reached. Clinical features in affected individuals include leukodystrophy, LSS, cerebellar atrophy, corpus callosum abnormalities, developmental delay, ataxia, dystonia, dysarthria, myopathy, nystagmus, and lactic acidosis.\n\nThis gene-disease association is also supported by the known biochemical function of *NUBPL* in complex I assembly, functional alteration in patient cells, rescue studies, a yeast model, and a mouse model (PMIDs: 32518176, 31787496, 20818383, 29982452, 36280881). \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between *NUBPL* and primary mitochondrial disease. This relationship has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on September 19, 2024 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0f9f7474-2ef3-45d3-91ca-3b555b0bef97","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/940d64cb-da20-4608-961d-345d6c8b437c","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/940d64cb-da20-4608-961d-345d6c8b437c_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2024-09-19T04:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/940d64cb-da20-4608-961d-345d6c8b437c_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2025-01-14T16:32:02.926Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/940d64cb-da20-4608-961d-345d6c8b437c_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/940d64cb-da20-4608-961d-345d6c8b437c_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5d5a91a8-c147-4e6e-892b-12b5283ed047","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Knock-in mouse with c.311T>C; p.

Both had similar findings on two serial brain MRIs at 4 months (abnormal T2 signal hyperintensity diffusely involving the periventricular white matter, external capsule, corpus callosum, and thalami bilaterally which were enlarged and edematous; areas of associated restricted diffusion) and 22 months (evolution of diffuse supratentorial high T2-signal involving the cortex, white matter, and thalami with extensive associated volume loss and ex vacuo dilation of the lateral and third ventricles; new multifocal T2-signal hyperintensity was noted in the vermis; relative sparing of the basal ganglia, medial occipital lobes, hippocampus and brainstem). Brain MRS in the centrum semiovale showed a large lactate peak and reduced N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA) peak. Patient fibroblasts had severely decreased steady state levels of NUBPL protein. \n","sex":"Male","variant":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7edf49b2-c53a-4bed-b4ba-35db572eb5fc_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2d3ceb2c-d09a-4b8b-b955-2c25dd6589e0_variant_evidence_item"}]}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria","strengthScore":2.0},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d6700c98-d098-4e8c-8bdf-beb1501c944a_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b2114f81-db69-4a32-984a-cef76d78841a","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b2114f81-db69-4a32-984a-cef76d78841a_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30897263","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f85501c0-57f8-48ea-8123-9e3e739bbae2","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NR_120408.1(NUBPL):n.569-38788A>T (undefined)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA389480171"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":0.1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a92fc6be-d1ce-46f2-b206-4f1af9bf3dd5","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a92fc6be-d1ce-46f2-b206-4f1af9bf3dd5_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30897263","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c079e34f-57cb-496e-9b1c-fd59a7fdf938","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_025152.3(NUBPL):c.311T>C (p.Leu104Pro)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA250383"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":0.1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d6700c98-d098-4e8c-8bdf-beb1501c944a","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30897263","rdfs:label":"Balint_Case","allele":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f85501c0-57f8-48ea-8123-9e3e739bbae2"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c079e34f-57cb-496e-9b1c-fd59a7fdf938"}],"phenotypeFreeText":"This is a 25y woman at the time of report.
