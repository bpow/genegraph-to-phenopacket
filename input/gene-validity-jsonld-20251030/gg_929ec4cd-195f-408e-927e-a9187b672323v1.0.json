At least three unique variants (nonsense and frameshift) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 15 probands in 4 publications (PMID: 29961571, 29982980, 32203226, 33234333). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in at least 11 additional family members. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence has been reached. The mechanism of disease is suspected to be homozygous or compound heterozygous loss of function. This gene-disease association is supported by a mouse model and expression studies (PMID: 29961571, 29982980). In summary, there is strong evidence to support the relationship between MPZL2 and autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss. Three years must elapse from the first proposal of the association to reach a definitive classification without any valid contradictory evidence. We will re-evaluate this gene-disease relationship at that time to determine if an upgraded classification of definitive is warranted. This curation was approved by the Hearing Loss Gene Curation Expert Panel on 3/26/21 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/929ec4cd-195f-408e-927e-a9187b672323","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/046d28d7-60d8-4c7e-a901-37c86fa6a77e","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Strong","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/046d28d7-60d8-4c7e-a901-37c86fa6a77e_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2021-03-29T18:53:27.648Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/046d28d7-60d8-4c7e-a901-37c86fa6a77e_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2021-03-26T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/046d28d7-60d8-4c7e-a901-37c86fa6a77e_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/046d28d7-60d8-4c7e-a901-37c86fa6a77e_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6cbde05f-32ec-4a5d-9613-afdeb0d03260","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Upgraded to 3 points for histological analysis.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1775b4a7-cc85-4b71-9ba9-5c585c5797b8","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Audiograms show mild hearing loss in 4-week-old mice, and rapidly progressive moderate to severe hearing loss in 8 and 12-week-old mice respectively.\nLoss of hair and supporting cells in organ of Corti, and loss of neurons in spiral ganglion to some degree at all levels of mutant mice cochlea (basal, medial, and apical).","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29961571","rdfs:label":"Wesdorp Mouse Model","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":3}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":3},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/046d28d7-60d8-4c7e-a901-37c86fa6a77e_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3621dfd8-91e5-460f-85f3-e13f5ed00b5c","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5aa76847-f466-4bd3-a44b-588f119a0155","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Immunofluorescence in WT mice showed that MPZL2 is expressed in the organ of Corti and stria vascularis.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29961571","rdfs:label":"Expression in WT mice","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/05d8d2ff-aa53-4041-9545-6626feda87d1","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6e856f36-3d2c-40ab-baf8-44dc2ae710b1","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Analyzed RNA derived from fetal heart, skeletal muscle, lung, brain colon, kidney, stomach, spleen and thymus, and from adult skeletal muscle, liver, duodenum, stomach, spleen, thymus, testis, heart, brain, kidney, bone marrow, placenta, and fetal cochlea.
