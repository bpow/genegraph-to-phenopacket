They are identical except for their bHLH domains, which are provided by alternatively spliced exons. E12 and E47 are essential in the differentiation process of common lymphoid progenitors into B-lineage cells and are key regulators of B-cell development. Both autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive inheritance have been reported. Due to lack of distinctive features in the small number of patients reported and the experimental evidence that supports autosomal recessive and autosomal dominant disease, the antibody deficiency GCEP came to the decision of lumping both modes of inheritance at this stage.\n\nA de-novo mutation that results in a dominant negative effect, has been reported in 5 unrelated individuals in 2 publications (PMIDs: 24216514 and 33905048). A heterozygous frameshift has been detected in a proband with reduced switched memory cells and recurrent infections (PMID: 29114388). Biallelic TCF3 mutations (a large deletion and a nonsense) have been reported in 3 patients (PMIDs: 30063982 and Barbouche, et al., 2016)\n\nExperimental evidence includes expression in relevant tissues and animal model. B cells of E2A (-I-) mice are arrested at an early stage of B cell differentiation. Heterozygote animals also showed decreased numbers of both pro-B and mature B cells (PMID: 8001124).\nIn summary *TCF3* is definitively associated with autosomal agammaglobulinemia. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time.\nGene Clinical Validity Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) -SOP8\n\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0c4e3b74-9fc3-465f-b7cc-f5e7ebb8a9a5","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/402ff7db-2e09-4e76-9284-1e7c4ae84fb3","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/402ff7db-2e09-4e76-9284-1e7c4ae84fb3_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10080","date":"2023-01-07T12:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/402ff7db-2e09-4e76-9284-1e7c4ae84fb3_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10080","date":"2023-01-07T11:46:14.093Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/402ff7db-2e09-4e76-9284-1e7c4ae84fb3_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ccd1445a-cf62-416a-a086-3f187f56b2ce_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/90ddf987-f73e-4c25-8fd9-a5e105dc41dc","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The variant is a de novo heterozygous c.1663G>A transition in exon 18b, which is specific to the E47 isoform of the TCF3 gene, resulting in a glu555-to-lys (E555K) substitution at a highly conserved residue in the DNA-binding domain.
