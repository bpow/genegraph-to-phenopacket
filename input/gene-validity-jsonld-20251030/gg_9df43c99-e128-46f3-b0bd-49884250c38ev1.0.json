This single case report described a homozygous splice variant predicted to undergo NMD that was present in the heterozygous state in both unaffected parents and one unaffected sibling. Expression of CD81 and CD19 was found to be absent on the patient's B cells and reduced for familial carriers.This gene-disease relationship is further supported by protein interactions (Bradbury et al., 1992,  PMID: 1383329), boichemical function (Tedder, et al., 1997, PMID: 9047233), and expression analysis (Oren,  et al., 1990, PMID: 1695320). Three independent CD81-knockout mice were found to partially recapitulate the cellular and molecular phenotype seen in the human patient, but did not exhibit an overlapping clinical phenotype (Miyazaki, et al., 1997, PMID: 9250665, Tsitsikov, et al., 1997, PMID: 9380722, Maecker, et al., 1997, PMID: 9126932). In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more\nevidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory\nevidence has emerged.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9df43c99-e128-46f3-b0bd-49884250c38e","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e2092b4c-a8ff-4b40-bc09-17fbe33aa3e7","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e2092b4c-a8ff-4b40-bc09-17fbe33aa3e7_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10080","date":"2021-04-29T21:08:06.386Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e2092b4c-a8ff-4b40-bc09-17fbe33aa3e7_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10080","date":"2021-04-29T21:08:24.538Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"Only 1 patient has been described in the literature, which does not meet the criteria for a moderate classification","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e2092b4c-a8ff-4b40-bc09-17fbe33aa3e7_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/93c6b1e0-e452-4c87-a6b8-f9196e7f76b6_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"A homozygous splice variant in CD81, c.561+1G>A, was identified in a 6-year-old female patient with progressive nephropathy and hypogammaglobulinemia born to consanguineous parents.
