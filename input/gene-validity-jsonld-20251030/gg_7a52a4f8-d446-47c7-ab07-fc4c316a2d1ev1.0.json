HPS is characterized by platelet dysfunction and oculocutaneous albinism, with diffuse hypopigmentation of the hair, skin, iris, and retina that leads to reduced visual acuity and nystagmus. Due to impaired platelet function, patients with HPS frequently suffer epistaxis or easy bruising, but might also experience more severe bleeding episodes, especially menorrhagia or postpartum bleeding. At least 39 unique variants including missense, nonsense, splice site, frameshift and large deletions have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been curated for 8 probands in 4 publications (PMIDs: 12548288, 30387913, 19843503, 27917594). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 1 additional family member (PMID: 27917594). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic and experimental evidence has been reached. This gene-disease relationship is supported by its interaction with HPS5 in the BLOC-2 complex (PMID: 12548288), which has a biochemical function in organelle biogenesis associated with melanosomes, platelet dense granules, and lysosomes (PMID: 26008744), as well as the functional alteration observed in patient cells (PMID: 19843503). Additionally the nop frog model (PMID: 27595926) and ruby-eye mouse model (PMID: 12548288) both recapitulate phenotypes of human HPS. In summary, HPS6 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome 6. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7a52a4f8-d446-47c7-ab07-fc4c316a2d1e","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/602ae8f1-9e7f-4cc6-bf70-d572d98828c5","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/602ae8f1-9e7f-4cc6-bf70-d572d98828c5_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2020-11-25T19:04:02.865Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/602ae8f1-9e7f-4cc6-bf70-d572d98828c5_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2020-11-25T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/602ae8f1-9e7f-4cc6-bf70-d572d98828c5_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/536fbaa3-f3aa-487c-9029-0fee52508e4f_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Compound heterozygous variants Gln505Ter and c.206_210dup were identified in this proband.
