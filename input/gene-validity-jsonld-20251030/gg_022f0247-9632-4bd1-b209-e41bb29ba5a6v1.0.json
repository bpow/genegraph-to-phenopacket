Variation in other telomere related genes like *TERT* and *TERC* have been shown to be related to interstitial lung disease (ILD), but to date ILD has not been observed for this gene-disease entity (PMID 38718684). Seven variants (6 missense, and 1 stop-loss extension) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data from 3 different publications describing a total of 4 probands with ages of onset being reported in both childhood and adulthood. Additionally, 4 families have been reported with heterozygous variant carriers that have presented with features consistent with TBD. The ClinGen Interstitial Lung Disease GCEP has decided to exclude heterozygous cases from this curation due to high population frequencies and/or lack of sufficient detail regarding genotyping. If, however, more convincing data of autosomal dominant inheritance becomes available, the curated entity and classification will be revisited. This gene-disease relationship is supported by protein interaction data, a yeast model and functional alteration in non-patient cells; PMID 11160879, 11074001, 37440454). Experimental data demonstrated that variant NHP2 is related to a decrease in the expression of TERC, and that expression of variant NHP2 and interaction with NOP10 and DKC1 were reduced. The mechanism is unclear but thought to be LOF. In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Interstitial Lung Disease GCEP on the meeting date April 15, 2025(SOP 11). This gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the General GCEP on June 1, 2017. It was reevaluated on August 1, 2025. Although additional case and experimental evidence (PMIDs: 37440454, 31985013) was published, the classification did not change.\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/022f0247-9632-4bd1-b209-e41bb29ba5a6","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a8fa9dcb-1cc6-43a2-8f86-e6cea0e6fce2","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10026","role":"SecondaryContributor"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a8fa9dcb-1cc6-43a2-8f86-e6cea0e6fce2_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10138","date":"2025-08-01T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a8fa9dcb-1cc6-43a2-8f86-e6cea0e6fce2_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10138","date":"2025-08-01T15:52:24.234Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["RecurationNewEvidence"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a8fa9dcb-1cc6-43a2-8f86-e6cea0e6fce2_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a8fa9dcb-1cc6-43a2-8f86-e6cea0e6fce2_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c69deeab-006d-4c0e-ad0d-75792552b29f","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Default score awarded since human TERC and NHP2 were introduced in to yeast and showed the same reduction in TERC expression observed in human cell lines","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/979545c2-a84f-4828-a6aa-4cc0991ec951","type":"Finding","dc:description":"NHP2 interacts with H/ACA box containing RNAs, which describes TERC, the template for adding TTAGGG repeats to the ends of telomeres and the availability of mature TERC is reduced when there are NHP2 LOF variants or loss of expression due to more damaging variation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11160879","rdfs:label":"Human NHP2/TERC yeast model","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a8fa9dcb-1cc6-43a2-8f86-e6cea0e6fce2_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0f0dba0e-d2d7-45c9-a88f-0bdd3b4ed4eb","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/97b25505-7cf0-498b-831a-a39059649bb2","type":"Finding","dc:description":"NHP2 was shown to coimmunoprecipitate H/ACA box containing snoRNAs U17 and U19 in addition to TERC.
