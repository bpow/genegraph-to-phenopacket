The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss-of-function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence (NCBI fetal expression-level data, fish embryo model). Expression-level data from NCBI shows solid expression in the heart at 10 weeks gestation. Gene-editing of USP44 in fish embryos resulted in abnormal heart morphology and looping defects. In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Congenital Heart Disease GCEP on the meeting date 10/15/24 (SOP Version 11).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d6eb76c8-f1e2-44f5-b781-372fc701bd78","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1e8a9135-a29a-4bff-be2b-84c01e104021","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1e8a9135-a29a-4bff-be2b-84c01e104021_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10130","date":"2024-10-15T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1e8a9135-a29a-4bff-be2b-84c01e104021_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10130","date":"2025-01-09T01:52:56.977Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1e8a9135-a29a-4bff-be2b-84c01e104021_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1e8a9135-a29a-4bff-be2b-84c01e104021_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/36beeac3-ba86-4e60-89b1-358be6a6d7ea","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Downgraded as the model organism is not the best one for evaluating the impact of a human phenotype.
