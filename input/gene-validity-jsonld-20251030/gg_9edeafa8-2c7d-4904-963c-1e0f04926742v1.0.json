Hereditary angioedema is characterized by recurrent episodes of the accumulation of fluids outside of the blood vessels, causing rapid swelling of tissues in the hands, feet, limbs, face, intestinal tract, or airway. The majority of HAE cases has a *SERPING1* variant as the underlying cause, which results in C1-INH deficiency. Two variants of C1-INH-HAE are described: C1-INH type I results from a failure to synthesize C1-INH, whereas in type II, an abnormal, non-functional protein is synthesized (PMID: 34065094).\n\n*SERPING1* was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant HAE-C1-INH as early as 1989 by Ariga et al  (PMID: 2723063). More than a 100 nonsense, splice site, frameshift, deletion/duplication and missense variants have been reported in humans in the ClinVar database. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data.   \n   \nSummary of Case Level Data (12 points):\nVariants in this gene have been reported in at least 13 probands in 7 publications (PMID: 2723063, 3587308, 35386643, 31982983, 2118657, 12402344, 7883978). Variants segregated with disease in several additional family members (PMID: 3587308, 31982983). The mechanism for disease is haploinsufficiency (HAE-C1-INH type I) and dominant negative (HAE-C1-INH type II).  \n  \nSummary of experimental data (6 points):\nThis gene-disease association is supported by in vitro functional assays and animal models. C1-INH plays a central role in the kallikrein-kinin system. C1-INH has a crucial role in regulating important physiological pathways including complement activation, blood coagulation, fibrinolysis and the generation of kinins (PMID: 35958943, 9234243). SERPING1 performs a role similar to PLG and F12, which are also involved in the coagulation and complement activation pathways (PMID: 9234243, 33535668). Serping1 -/- mouse has been recently described, which recapitulates the acute angioedema phenotype (PMID: 34354123). Heterozygous C1 esterase inhibitor deficient mice showed significantly lower serum levels of murine C1-INH and increased vascular permeability, which were restored to wild-type levels when AAV-mediated human C1-INH was introduced to heterozygous mice (PMID: 30059156). \n  \nIn summary, *SERPING*1 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant hereditary angioedema with C1Inh deficiency. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9edeafa8-2c7d-4904-963c-1e0f04926742","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bb571a69-47a6-4e28-a837-b9df492526c9","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bb571a69-47a6-4e28-a837-b9df492526c9_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10080","date":"2022-12-19T22:15:16.011Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bb571a69-47a6-4e28-a837-b9df492526c9_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10080","date":"2022-12-15T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bb571a69-47a6-4e28-a837-b9df492526c9_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/369124a3-650d-47a2-b344-dd55f8fbf262","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The proband and at least 11 other family members were heterozygous for the deep intronic variant, c.1029+384A>G.
