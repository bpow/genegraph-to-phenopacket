Each patient is compound heterozygous for partial to full loss of function variants, for a total of four variants (3 missense and one frameshift). *PIK3CG* encodes the p110γ catalytic subunit of PI3Kγ, which phosphorylates PtdIns(4,5)P2 to produce PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, a versatile second messenger that potently activates diverse signaling cascades to coordinate the cellular response to growth factors, cytokines, chemokines, and antigen receptor stimulation, among other inputs.  Data are consistent with a mechanistic model in which deficiency in PI3Kγ results in GSK3-dependent overproduction of IL-12 and IL-23 by myeloid cells, leading to increased T cell accumulation in tissues that, together with defective immunoglobulin production and reduced regulatory T cells, underlies disease pathophysiology. Experimentally, this gene-disease relationship is supported by its increased expression in tissues involved in immune responses (PMID: 24014027) and function as a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PMID: 24014027) which participates in T cell receptor–induced T cell activation (PMID: 17998387) which was observed in both patient and knock out cells (PMID: 33054089). Additionally, the defects in patient T cells are rescued with wild type protein (PMID: 33054089). Finally, multiple mouse models have been reported (PMID: 10669416, PMID: 31554793) that recapitulate the disease. In summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c8486a14-a6e7-4b9c-ba68-6c8ab9ef32a4","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c042f849-508e-4125-be10-cfa6750408ef","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c042f849-508e-4125-be10-cfa6750408ef_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10080","date":"2023-07-18T12:24:55.034Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c042f849-508e-4125-be10-cfa6750408ef_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10080","date":"2023-07-18T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c042f849-508e-4125-be10-cfa6750408ef_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e06c04d4-2d73-4685-be39-ac2cb34d8e16_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cf7d4376-3322-4e81-be59-5a25bc715a71","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"gnomADv2.1.1 HMAF 0.00004663 (6/128666 alleles) in the European (non-Finnish) population.","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cf7d4376-3322-4e81-be59-5a25bc715a71_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"The paternal R1021P substitution in the kinase domain destabilizes hydrogen bonds predicted to be necessary for protein stability and nearly completely abolishes in vitro recombinant kinase activity of p110γ alone or bound to either p84 or p101 subunit.","functionalDataSupport":"Yes"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cf7d4376-3322-4e81-be59-5a25bc715a71_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31554793","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a85c91a0-3fdc-428e-9d14-ef545f6290d2","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001282426.2(PIK3CG):c.3062G>C (p.Arg1021Pro)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA164129242"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/889371cc-4f6d-4a2d-8d1a-e8e4cc407adc","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"This maternally inherited frameshift in exon 10 of 11 creates a premature stop codon predicted to undergo NMD, consistent with the virtually absent protein expression in the patient.\n\ngnomADv2.1.1 HMAF 0.000008800 (1/113640 alleles) in the European (non-Finnish) population.","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/889371cc-4f6d-4a2d-8d1a-e8e4cc407adc_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31554793","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/351b9da2-aa9b-4a88-a367-167b107dc4d1","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001282426.2(PIK3CG):c.2944del (p.Arg982GlufsTer6)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA577198492"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e06c04d4-2d73-4685-be39-ac2cb34d8e16","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31554793","rdfs:label":"A.1","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":9,"allele":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a85c91a0-3fdc-428e-9d14-ef545f6290d2"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/351b9da2-aa9b-4a88-a367-167b107dc4d1"}],"detectionMethod":"Trio WES with Sanger confirmation","firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"Reduced Treg cells and increased CXCR3+ tissue-homing Th1-like T cells.
