One pathogenic nonsense variant has been reported in 4 probands in 3 publications (PMIDs: 26197441, 35254497, 36454368). This variant was detected in families from different genetic ancestry groups which suggests that the Arg192 residue is a mutational hotspot, rather than a founder variant. This variant was found to segregate in 24 additional family members in two families (PMID: 26197441, 35254497). This gene disease relationship is also supported by expression and protein interaction studies (PMID: 26197441). In summary there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease association. This gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the ClinGen Hearing Loss GCEP on 3/20/2018 as per SOP v6. It was reevaluated on 6/25/2024 using SOP v10. As a result of this reevaluation, new case level evidence has been reviewed or added, but the classification did not change (PMIDs: 35254497, 36454368, 36597107).\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7a12e476-567b-40bf-9ea6-45ac5e39c627","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e9524ca4-7d17-4691-b650-0d457531c7fd","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","changes":[{"id":"cg:newEvidence"},{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},{"id":"cg:classificationChange"},{"id":"cg:sopChange"},{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e9524ca4-7d17-4691-b650-0d457531c7fd_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2024-06-25T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e9524ca4-7d17-4691-b650-0d457531c7fd_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2024-08-07T15:47:37.652Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["RecurationCommunityRequest"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e9524ca4-7d17-4691-b650-0d457531c7fd_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e9524ca4-7d17-4691-b650-0d457531c7fd_seg_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/616897c7-b4c0-440f-8c90-b2639c83bf79_proband_segregation","type":"FamilyCosegregation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35254497","rdfs:label":"Family
