(PMID:1774074). Malignant hyperthermia is a pharmacogenetic disorder of skeletal muscle calcium regulation associated with uncontrolled skeletal muscle metabolism with significant morbidity in response to specific anesthetics. Numerous unique missense variants have been reported in humans and the mechanism for disease is heterozygous gain-of-function. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level, segregation, and experimental data. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. Of note, this gene has also been implicated in autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive congenital myopathies. These associations have been assessed separately by the ClinGen Congenital Myopathies GCEP. In summary, RYR1 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant malignant hyperthermia susceptibility. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen General GCEP on 11/25/2020.
