{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/baa12351-0dc1-4461-b170-32c156af360bv1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"The *POLE* gene encodes the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase epsilon, which is involved in DNA repair and possibly also in replication of chromosomal DNA. POLE was first reported as an autosomal dominant cancer susceptibility condition in 2013 (Palles et al, PMID: 23263490). Likely pathogenic/pathogenic variants located with the exonuclease domain of POLE are associated with an increased risk of colon polyps and colorectal cancer. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in molecular mechanism(s), inheritance pattern and phenotypic variability between cancer susceptibility to colon cancer and colon polyps. Therefore, the following disease entities have been lumped into POLE-related polyposis and colorectal cancer syndrome (MONDO:0100287). However, due to the phenotypic variability, variant type and different inheritance pattern, autosomal recessive Facial Dysmorphism, Immunodeficiency, Livedo, and Short Stature (FILS) syndrome and Intrauterine Growth Retardation, Metaphyseal Dysplasia, Adrenal Hypoplasia, Congenita, Genetial Anomalies, and Immunodeficiency (IMAGE-I) syndrome have been split from this curation. Two missense and one truncated variants that have been reported in seven publications (PMIDs: 25370038, 32792570, 26133394, 24501277, 23263490, 25529843, 34761457) are included in this curation. The variant segregates with disease for each family described. Probands had colon cancer and/or history of multiple colon polyps and were negative for pathogenic variants in the APC and MUTYH genes. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is due to mutations that occur within the exonuclease domain of the POLE gene, which results in a decrease in DNA replication fidelity. This gene-disease association is also supported by experimental evidence (1.75 points) including mouse and yeast models (PMIDs: 19805137, 16699561). These studies demonstrated that mutations in the exonuclease domain of POLE lead to the underlying mechanism of pathogenicity. In summary, POLE is definitively associated with autosomal dominant POLE-related polyposis and colorectal cancer syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the Colon Cancer Expert Panel on 12/11/2017. The ClinGen Hereditary Cancer GCEP reevaluated on 01/27/2023 (SOP Version 9). As a result of this reevaluation, the classification did not change although the  disease name was changed to mirror both features of the disorder.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/baa12351-0dc1-4461-b170-32c156af360b","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8b5306f4-0422-42fc-9f67-2d9b263e4e1e","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8b5306f4-0422-42fc-9f67-2d9b263e4e1e_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10023","date":"2023-07-06T01:47:34.665Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8b5306f4-0422-42fc-9f67-2d9b263e4e1e_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10023","date":"2023-07-05T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8b5306f4-0422-42fc-9f67-2d9b263e4e1e_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8b5306f4-0422-42fc-9f67-2d9b263e4e1e_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a96cc764-88c0-4d42-9e81-9ace05a817f1","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Those who were heterzygous were indistinguishable from wild type.
