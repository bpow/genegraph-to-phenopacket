Physical examination revealed mild hepatomegaly. Blood glucose was 1.2 mmol/l (norm: >3 mmol/l). Apart from elevated transaminases (aspartate aminotransferase 283 U/l, norm: 10–27 U/l; alanine aminotransferase 138 U/l, norm: 5–23 U/l) and lactate dehydrogenase (1502 U/l, norm: 200–500 U/l), there were no other abnormalities in routine clinical chemical analysis. Urinary organic acid analysis revealed massive dicarboxylic aciduria without adequate ketonuria. Acylcarnitines analyses in dried blood spots were normal. The patient recovered well under intravenous glucose infusion. Enzyme studies in fibroblasts showed normal beta-oxidation capacity. A monitored fasting test was performed, leading to hypoglycaemia (blood glucose 2.3 mmol/l) 12 h after the last meal. At this time, there was massive elevation of plasma free fatty acids (3290 µmol/l, norm: <300 µmol/l) without concomitant elevation of total plasma ketones (174 µmol/l, norm: <150 µmol/l, in fasting: >1500 µmol/l). Blood lactate, insulin and transaminases were within normal ranges. Urinary organic acids again showed massive dicarboxylic aciduria without adequate ketonuria; acylcarnitines in dried blood spots were normal. The patient was started on carnitine (100 mg/kg body weight) and the family was advised to avoid fasting for more than 8 h and to administer a caloric drink at around midnight. Under this regimen, there were no subsequent hypoglycaemic episodes and, at present, the child (4 years old) is developing normally with no residual neurological impairment.","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001943","obo:HP_0002240"],"previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2f8e0d00-7d54-4de9-bc76-38adb9adcf65_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11479731","allele":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/42808839-8edd-4d58-b392-bd714282a7cf","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_005518.3(HMGCS2):c.634G>A (p.Gly212Arg)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA120256"}},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/55948608-8d48-4129-a09d-af25b12c5177","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001166107.1(HMGCS2):c.1373G>A (p.Arg458His)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/9260"}}]}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c17c3e7d-cf01-4375-8676-9f7a371eb8a2_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"A functional study by Ramos 2013 (PMID 23751782) showed that the missense mutation p.G388R did not produce proteins that could have been detected in soluble form by western blot.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2f05a038-6bc1-4eee-9889-fb426939e34b","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23751782","rdfs:label":"Ninth patient","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":15,"detectionMethod":"","ethnicity":{"id":"cg:HispanicOrLatino"},"firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"The patient was a 15-month-old boy, the first child of nonconsanguineous Caucasian parents.

After the ingestion of medium-chain triglycerides plasma concentrations of hydroxy fatty acids, including 3-hydroxyhexanoate and 3-hydroxyoctanoate, increased markedly.
