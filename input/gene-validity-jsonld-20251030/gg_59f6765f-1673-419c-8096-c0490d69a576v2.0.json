The protein complex formed with RAD51D protein has been shown to catalyze homologous pairing between single- and double-stranded DNA and is thought to play a role in the early stage of recombinational repair of DNA. RAD51D has been linked to autosomal dominant RAD51D-related cancer predisposition which includes familial ovarian cancer, triple negative breast cancer and ER negative breast cancer. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in molecular mechanism(s) or inheritance pattern among the different cancer predispositions. Therefore, these phenotypes have been lumped into this RAD51D-related cancer predisposition curation. This gene-disease relationship has been studied in at least eight case-control studies at the aggregate variant level. These case-control studies suggested significantly increased risk for ovarian cancer in monoallelic RAD51D variant carriers compared to controls (12 points) (PMIDs: 26261251, 26720728, 30099541, 31341520, 32091585, 33471991, 35084436, 35172496). This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence including functional alteration and protein interaction studies (1.5 points; PMIDs: 10749867, 11751635, 27924006). RAD51D-deficient cells had a significantly higher frequency of spontaneous double-strand break. In addition, these cells had a severely reduced capacity for homologous recombination-mediated DNA repair. Yeast two-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation assays also revealed RAD51D directly interacts with RAD51C and forms a protein complex. In summary, RAD51D is definitively associated with RAD51D-related cancer predisposition (MONDO:0700274). This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This gene-disease pair was originally evaluated as definitive for familial ovarian cancer on 10/11/2017 and as limited for hereditary breast carcinoma on 11/08/2017 by the Breast/Ovarian Cancer GCEP. This lumped re-curation as definitive was approved by the ClinGen Hereditary Cancer GCEP on 03/22/2024 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/59f6765f-1673-419c-8096-c0490d69a576","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2d2e5a83-03cb-4483-915d-6ac32a84dc0a","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":[{"id":"cg:newEvidence"},{"id":"cg:sopChange"},{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2d2e5a83-03cb-4483-915d-6ac32a84dc0a_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10023","date":"2024-08-29T20:38:41.957Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2d2e5a83-03cb-4483-915d-6ac32a84dc0a_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10023","date":"2024-08-29T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["RecurationNewEvidence","DiseaseNameUpdate","RecurationTiming","RecurationFrameworkChange"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2d2e5a83-03cb-4483-915d-6ac32a84dc0a_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2d2e5a83-03cb-4483-915d-6ac32a84dc0a_cc_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9d31727f-f99f-4666-8c95-665732d5f34a","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Authors estimate that RAD51B, RAD51C, and RAD51D are responsible for approximately one in every 90 high-grade serous EOC occurrences and one in every 120 EOC occurrences.","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9d31727f-f99f-4666-8c95-665732d5f34a_cc_evidence_item","type":"Finding","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26261251","rdfs:label":"Song et al.

We found that RAD51B (Fig. 4A) and RAD51D (Fig. ​(Fig.4B)4B) were individually bound by RAD51C-his10, and that RAD51B and RAD51D could be bound simultaneously by RAD51Chis10 (Fig. 4C). In the absence of RAD51C, however, interactions between RAD51B-his6 and RAD51D were not observed (Fig. 4D).

Prior to having the full-length human RAD51D cDNA, we used the mouse cDNA in some initial experiments (Fig. 1). All of the other mammalian Rad51 paralogs in our studies are human proteins. Like the HsRad51D protein, the mouse Rad51D protein also interacts with XRCC2, although much more weakly (Table I). XRCC2 does not interact with itself (Fig. 1) nor does either HsRad51D (Table I) or MmRad51D (Fig. 1). Rad51C Interacts Weakly with Human Rad51D but More Strongly with Mouse Rad51D—Human Rad51C was originally found to interact moderately with MmRad51D (Fig. 1), but to our surprise, Rad51C interacts only very weakly with the HsRad51D. The Y190 two-hybrid strain transformed with both RAD51C and HsRAD51D are pale blue on X-gal plates; similarly, the PJ69-4A strain is ade1, but very slow growing on plates lacking adenine (data not shown). A more detailed analysis of the interaction between Rad51C and Rad51D is presented below under three-hybrid results. The Yeast Rad51 Protein Interacts with Both the Human Rad51 and XRCC3 Protein.\n\nThe yeast two-hybrid system was used to determine whether any of the human Rad51 paralogs could interact with the yeast (S. cerevisiae) Rad51 paralogs. The only strongly positive results were the interaction of XRCC3 with yeast Rad51 and the interaction of yeast Rad51 with human Rad51 (Table II). A very weak interaction was observed between yeast Rad51 and Rad51C and between yeast Rad55 and human Rad51. All of these results are consistent with the high conservation of the yeast and human Rad51proteins\"","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10749867","rdfs:label":"Schild Protein Interaction","demonstrates":{"id":"obo:MI_0915"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2d2e5a83-03cb-4483-915d-6ac32a84dc0a_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a504d827-a6e6-41d6-829e-7b907f91679e","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/87eaeddf-d333-4fd6-84a5-0a777df51dcf","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"We found that RAD51D-deficient cells had a significantly higher frequency of spontaneous and ISceI DSB-induced selectable marker loss.
