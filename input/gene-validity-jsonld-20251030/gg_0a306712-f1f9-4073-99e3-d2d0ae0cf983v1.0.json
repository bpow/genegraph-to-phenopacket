The *COQ4* gene encodes ubiquinone biosynthesis protein COQ4, which functions as part of the coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) biosynthetic pathway. \n\nThe *COQ4* gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive primary mitochondrial disease in 2015 (PMID: 25658047). While various names have been given to the constellation of features seen in those with *COQ4*-related disease, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *COQ4* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included eleven unique variants (eight missense, one stop-gained, one frameshift, and one in-frame deletion variant) identified in seven individuals from four publications (PMIDs: 25658047, 30225196, 28540186, 30659264). Affected individuals have a broad spectrum of features that range from an early onset multisystem encephalopathy with myopathy and cardiac involvement to a less severe, later onset ataxia-spasticity disorder. Reduced levels of CoQ10 and reduced activities of complex I+III and II+III are commonly observed in patient tissues and cells. No segregation data were available for scoring. The mechanism of disease appears to be loss of function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by a biochemical function shared with other genes associated with primary mitochondrial disease, and specifically coenzyme Q10 deficiency; early embryonic lethality in a knockout mouse model; wild-type rescue of growth and COQ synthesis defects in a null yeast model; and wild-type rescue of mitochondrial dysfunction in patient-derived iPSCs and differentiated myocytes (PMIDs: 33340416, 18474229, 29539633, 28472853). \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between *COQ4* and autosomal recessive primary mitochondrial disease. This relationship has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on January 30, 2023 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0a306712-f1f9-4073-99e3-d2d0ae0cf983","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7d59cb98-0dd9-4707-8464-876eee053467","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7d59cb98-0dd9-4707-8464-876eee053467_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2023-01-30T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7d59cb98-0dd9-4707-8464-876eee053467_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2023-08-10T20:49:42.053Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"\n","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7d59cb98-0dd9-4707-8464-876eee053467_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3bafffb9-ae59-459e-b772-bda1450c20a3_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/01db1e26-7979-4346-908d-b280cefa715d","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"0.1 (other) +0.4 (functional-patient cells) +0.4 (functional-yeast) +0.25(biochem/phenotype)","calculatedScore":1.0,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/01db1e26-7979-4346-908d-b280cefa715d_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"By Seahorse micro-oxygraphy, maximal respiratory rates were shown to be lower in S5 fibroblasts than in control cells (Figure 2B).
