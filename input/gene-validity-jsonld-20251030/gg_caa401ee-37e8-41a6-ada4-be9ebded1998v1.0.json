The gene was later associated with distal hereditary motor neuropathy (MONDO:0018894) and distal myopathy (OMIM: 610099) in a candidate gene analysis of multiple families, each with differing phenotypes, in 2021 (Beijer et al., PMID: 34291734). Following assessment of the criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, the ALS GCEP found that although there were not clear differences in molecular mechanisms and inheritance patterns between *hnRNPA1*’s associations with inclusion body myopathy, distal hereditary motor neuropathy, or distal myopathy and with ALS 20, there was observable phenotypic variability. Additionally, there was concern that lumping the phenotypes would falsely inflate the score of *hnRNPA1* based on the wide range of associations. Therefore, the phenotypes were split from ALS 20.\n\nNo case-control analyses were reported for the curation of *hnRNPA1*; however, one family presenting with flail arm syndrome ALS was scorable with four segregations and a calculated LOD score of 1.2 (Liu et al., 2016, PMID: 27694260). Additionally, seven variants reported in seven probands across six publications (PMID: 23455423, 27694260, 29033165, 32616036, 34291734, 36314424) were scored in this curation. Importantly, four of the variants had functional evidence supporting their pathogenicity. Based on the curation, a genetic evidence score of 2.3 was reached. The gene-disease curation was also supported by experimental evidence, including functional evidence of expression and protein interactions with other relevant ALS-associated proteins from five publications (PMID: 33087501, 28077597, 27460707, 25616961, 25338872). Notably, the ALS GCEP chose to apply a gene-specific attenuation to downgrade certain protein interaction scores due to the high number of protein interactions observed for *hnRNPA1* with ALS-associated proteins. Only interactions that were proven to be disrupted by variants in either *hnRNPA1* or the gene encoding the interacting protein were given full scores of 0.5. An experimental evidence score of 2.0 was reached\n\nIn summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to establish *hnRNPA1*’s relationship with ALS 20, particularly regarding whether there is case-control evidence to suggest an association and the molecular mechanism of pathogenic variants, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged. This classification was approved by the ClinGen ALS GCEP on May 14, 2024 (SOP Version 10).\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/caa401ee-37e8-41a6-ada4-be9ebded1998","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5aaae20b-8253-4331-9bc1-4608d209df65","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5aaae20b-8253-4331-9bc1-4608d209df65_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10096","date":"2024-06-26T20:44:34.403Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5aaae20b-8253-4331-9bc1-4608d209df65_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10096","date":"2024-06-26T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5aaae20b-8253-4331-9bc1-4608d209df65_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5aaae20b-8253-4331-9bc1-4608d209df65_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4e3542f9-66ae-4661-9f2d-e52b486d8c44","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The phenotypes of the mice do not reflect phenotypes encompassed by ALS.

Background binding of hnRNPA1 to GST alone persisted, suggesting it is quite ‘sticky’. Subtraction of this background binding revealed that GST-ubiquilin-2 pulled down five times more hnRNPA1 than GST alone (Fig 3B). Also repeated GST-pull-down assays, but this time used purified bacterially expressed His-hnRNPA1 as ligand, and revealed preferential binding of His-hnRNPA1 with GST-ubiquilin-2 (Fig. 3C and D).\n\nConfirmed interaction by immunoprecipitating ubiquilin from HeLa cells using a pan-ubiquilin-specific antibody (Figure 4A). Because multiple ubiquilin proteins are expressed in HeLa cells (ubiquilin-1, 2 and 4 proteins), they next investigated whether hnRNPA1 binds ubiquilin-2. HeLa cells were either mock transfected or transfected with expression plasmids encoding either full-length HA-tagged ubiquilin-2 by itself or together with full-length Myc-tagged hnRNPA1. The blots showed endogenous hnRNPA1 coimmunoprecipitates with HA-tagged ubiquilin-2 (Fig. 4B).\n\nThey also investigated whether ubiquilin-2 proteins containing ALS mutations were altered in their ability to bind hnRNPA1 protein using immunoprecipitation. All ALS mutations (P497H, P497S, P506T, P509S and P525S) bind significantly less hnRNPA1 protein than does WT ubiquilin-2 (Fig. 4C and D).\n\nFinally, purified recombinant His-tagged hnRNPA1 proteins encoding either the WT or D262V mutant protein and examined binding to WT ubiquilin-2 by GST-pull-down assays (Fig. 5).

G304Nfs*3, even though it was not defined as such by the Allele Registry. To verify that the alternatively terminating variants were not subject to NMD, mRNA sequences for the G304Nfs*3 (family A) were assessed by PCR amplification from exon 8 into the 3′-UTR on cDNA from patient lymphoblasts. Gel electrophoresis and di-deoxy sequencing confirmed exon 11 skipping for the G304Nfs*3 splice variant (Sup Fig 1A). mRNA for the G304Nfs*3 was present, indicating the absence of NMD. Upon immunoblotting of HeLa expressing G304Nfs*3, the G304Nfs*3 mutation produced a shorter protein (Sup Fig 1E). Variant was also assessed in a yeast model. G304Nfs*3 was expressed to similar levels as the other hnRNPA1 proteins (Figure 3, B and C). Thus, hnRNPA1G304Nfs*3 may be less aggregation prone than hnRNPA1, hnRNPA1D262V, hnRNPA1P288A, and hnRNPA1*321Eext*6 while conferring similar toxicity (Figure 3A). \nTo assess the fibrillization propensity, they purified GST-TEV–tagged versions of the proteins from E. coli, initiated with a protease, and imaged with electron microscopy. hnRNPA1G304Nfs*3 displayed decelerated fibrillization, with only a few fibrils apparent after 24 hours (Figure 4, B and C). The decelerated fibrillization of G304Nfs*3 is also observed in other mutant proteins connected with neurodegenerative disease. \nIn HeLa cells G304Nfs*3 did not affect incorporation of hnRNPA1 into arsenite-induced SGs (Figure 5, A and B) and cells expressing WT hnRNPA1 or hnRNPA1G304Nfs*3 showed nearly complete SG disassembly after 60-minute recovery (Figure 5, D and E).

G304Nfs*3, even though it was not defined as such by the Allele Registry. To verify that the alternatively terminating variants were not subject to NMD, mRNA sequences for the G304Nfs*3 (family A) were assessed by PCR amplification from exon 8 into the 3′-UTR on cDNA from patient lymphoblasts. Gel electrophoresis and di-deoxy sequencing confirmed exon 11 skipping for the G304Nfs*3 splice variant (Sup Fig 1A). mRNA for the G304Nfs*3 was present, indicating the absence of NMD. Upon immunoblotting of HeLa expressing G304Nfs*3, the G304Nfs*3 mutation produced a shorter protein (Sup Fig 1E). Variant was also assessed in a yeast model. G304Nfs*3 was expressed to similar levels as the other hnRNPA1 proteins (Figure 3, B and C). Thus, hnRNPA1G304Nfs*3 may be less aggregation prone than hnRNPA1, hnRNPA1D262V, hnRNPA1P288A, and hnRNPA1*321Eext*6 while conferring similar toxicity (Figure 3A). To assess the fibrillization propensity, they purified GST-TEV–tagged versions of the proteins from E. coli, initiated with a protease, and imaged with electron microscopy. hnRNPA1G304Nfs*3 displayed decelerated fibrillization, with only a few fibrils apparent after 24 hours (Figure 4, B and C). The decelerated fibrillization of G304Nfs*3 is also observed in other mutant proteins connected with neurodegenerative disease. In HeLa cells G304Nfs*3 did not affect incorporation of hnRNPA1 into arsenite-induced SGs (Figure 5, A and B) and cells expressing WT hnRNPA1 or hnRNPA1G304Nfs*3 showed nearly complete SG disassembly after 60-minute recovery (Figure 5, D and E).","functionalDataSupport":"Yes"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2ee4e32f-d389-4580-8ca6-3bba0af63397_variant_evidence_item"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":0},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e84e7c9d-9b7d-474a-9b0f-739d718075b2","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"VUS in ClinVar.
