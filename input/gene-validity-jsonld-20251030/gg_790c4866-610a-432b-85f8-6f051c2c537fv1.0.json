TS is a novel disorder characterized by multiorgan dysfunction including arrhythmias, syndactyly, cardiac features, immune deficiency and neurological and developmental abnormalities. Two recurrent de novo variants on exon 8 and 8a (G406R and G402S) that have been reported in over 14 probands in 11 publications (PMIDs: 15454078, 15863612, 22106044, 23678275, 27390944, 16360093, 24773605, 23580742, 29194862, 27593853, 28371864) are included in this curation. Of note variants p.Arg518Cys/His seemingly have an isolated cardiac phenotype seen in 9 probands. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is known to be gain of function caused by missense variants. This gene-disease relationship is also strongly supported by animal models and expression studies (PMIDs: 8392192, 23045342, 21878566, 21216955). In summary, CACNA1C is definitively associated with Timothy syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in research and clinical diagnostic settings and upheld over time. This classification was approved by the Hereditary Cardiovascular Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on April 14, 2023.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/790c4866-610a-432b-85f8-6f051c2c537f","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a1fc2dfc-d200-40d0-9cd6-421276578e6e","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a1fc2dfc-d200-40d0-9cd6-421276578e6e_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10104","date":"2023-04-14T02:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a1fc2dfc-d200-40d0-9cd6-421276578e6e_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10104","date":"2024-07-18T00:55:33.518Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["RecurationNewEvidence"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a1fc2dfc-d200-40d0-9cd6-421276578e6e_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1d7d05f2-41e4-4a54-b63c-e31704de83af","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"De novo variant w/ confirmed maternity and paternity results.
