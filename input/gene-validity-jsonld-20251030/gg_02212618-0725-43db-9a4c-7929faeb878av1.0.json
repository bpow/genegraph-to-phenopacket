FHL is a hyperinflammatory syndrome caused by an uncontrolled and ineffective proliferation and activation of T lymphocytes, natural killer (NK) cells, and macrophages that infiltrate multiple organs, including liver, spleen, lymph nodes, and central nervous system (CNS), and produce massive amounts of cytokines. This overwhelming hyperimmune status results in a clinical picture characterized by persistent fever, hepatosplenomegaly, pancytopenia, hemophagocytosis in various tissues, coagulation abnormalities, and inflammatory CNS disease. Patients with FHL5 have several unique features, including sensorineural hearing deficit, abnormal bleeding, and severe diarrhea. *STXBP2* is involved in intracellular vesicle trafficking and vesicle fusion with membranes, it contributes to the granule exocytosis machinery through interaction with soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor proteins that regulate membrane fusion. The role of *STXBP2* in the cytotoxic granule pathway, and how variation in the gene results in FHL5 is currently not understood in detail but the mechanism of disease appears to be loss of function. This curation includes eleven variants (including in-frame deletions, missense, splicing, and frameshift) found in ten probands from two publications (PMIDs: 19804848, 22451424). Additional cases are available in the literature however the maximum score for genetic evidence has been reached. A role in disease is supported by increased expression of *STXBP2* in NK cells, T cells, monocytes, and other hematopoietic cells (PMID: 19804848), which is altered in patients (PMID: 19884660), resulting in altered cytotoxicity of patient NK cells and cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (PMID: 19804848). Additionally, degranulation defects were rescued in patient cells with wildtype *STXBP2* (PMID: 19884660). *STXBP2* is also known to interact with *STX11*, which has a well established relationship with FHL (PMID: 19804848). In summary *STXBP2* is definitively associated with autosomal recessive FHL5. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/02212618-0725-43db-9a4c-7929faeb878a","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0b5c9256-89e0-4f97-a7ca-dd07bdd237f9","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0b5c9256-89e0-4f97-a7ca-dd07bdd237f9_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10145","date":"2023-09-19T12:45:32.254Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0b5c9256-89e0-4f97-a7ca-dd07bdd237f9_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10145","date":"2023-09-19T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0b5c9256-89e0-4f97-a7ca-dd07bdd237f9_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/54398a40-c0de-4902-9a09-430425a9a2a6_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b67b8a19-1578-4511-aa2b-339af88e2d1d","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The frameshift variant introduces a premature stop codon in exon 6 of 19 and is predicted to cause NMD.","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b67b8a19-1578-4511-aa2b-339af88e2d1d_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19804848","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7e58c452-2802-4eec-a0d6-bf3db66eb01b","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_006949.4(STXBP2):c.260del (p.Leu87ArgfsTer?)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA913185061"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:AlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/56583742-88e6-4dae-a1b1-c0e7cf3ecdd2","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Analysis of patient RNA revealed a deletion of exon 15 (of 19) resulting in a frameshift and 126 new codons, with a premature stop codon in the penultimate exon, as a major event (p.Val417LeufsX126) but also a variety of other, including in-frame, products.\n\nPopmax filtering allele frequency 0.0002829 from gnomADv2.1.1 European (non-Finnish) population.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/56583742-88e6-4dae-a1b1-c0e7cf3ecdd2_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"From PMID: 22451424 -- An exogenous construct made with cDNA that harbors the c.1247-1356 deletion of the complete 110 nucleotides of exon 15, resulting in a premature stop (p.Val417LeuTer126) was used for coimmunoprecipitation analysis for binding with syntaxin 11.
