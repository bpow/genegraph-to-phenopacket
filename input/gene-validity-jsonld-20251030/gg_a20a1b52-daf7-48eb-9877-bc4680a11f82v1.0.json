Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in molecular mechanisms, inheritance pattern and phenotypic variability. Therefore, the following disease entities have been lumped into one disease entity: Atrial septal defect 9, Conotruncal heart malformations, Tetralogy of Fallot, Ventricular septal defect, Atrioventricular septal defect, Bicuspid aortic valve, Transposition of the great arteries, Persistent truncus arteriosus, Congenital heart disease with pancreatic agenesis, and Congenital heart disease with neonatal diabetes. At least ten unique variants (missense, nonsense, frameshift) that have been reported in ten probands in seven publications (PMIDs: 19666519, 23020118, 25937001, 28049534, 29653232, 31301121, 35595280) are included in this curation. Four of the ten variants were de novo occurrences. Variants in *GATA6* co-segregated in at least 4 members in a family with bicuspid aortic valve (PMID: 29653232). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. This gene-disease relationship is supported by biochemical function study, functional alteration data, and protein interaction data (PMIDs: 10330176, 32442395, 36525927, 10330176). Experimental evidence also includes a mouse model with conditional deletion of *GATA6* that recapitulated the CHD phenotype (PMID: 16557299), a hIPSC cell culture model showing the importance of *GATA6* in development of the heart, endodermal lineages, pancreas, and diaphragm (PMID: 33054971), and rescue in a zebrafish *GATA6* knockout mutant line (PMID: 36525927). In summary, *GATA6* is definitively associated with autosomal dominant *GATA6*- related congenital heart disease with or without pancreatic agenesis or neonatal diabetes. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Congenital Heart Disease GCEP on the meeting date 11/21/2023 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a20a1b52-daf7-48eb-9877-bc4680a11f82","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a7a0fdd7-f796-4921-95b6-709fd859b6d3","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a7a0fdd7-f796-4921-95b6-709fd859b6d3_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10130","date":"2023-11-21T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a7a0fdd7-f796-4921-95b6-709fd859b6d3_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10130","date":"2024-03-28T18:18:58.967Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a7a0fdd7-f796-4921-95b6-709fd859b6d3_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a7a0fdd7-f796-4921-95b6-709fd859b6d3_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2ba6773c-4301-4ff6-8b45-ee31c04196b9","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Downgraded as the model is a homozygous model for a dominant disease in human cases","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/63364722-141a-434b-a60c-8fff99eec875","type":"Finding","dc:description":"The mutation led to perinatal mortality from a spectrum of cardiovascular defects.
