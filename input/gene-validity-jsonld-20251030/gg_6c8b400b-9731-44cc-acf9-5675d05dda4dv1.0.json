This is a multisystem ciliopathy, with skeletal and ectodermal involvement. \nSeventeen variants (10 missense, 4 frameshift, 1 deletion, 2 intronic) have been reported in 10 probands in 6 publications (PMIDs: 20493458, 24689072, 26792575, 29037998, 23826986, 33717254).  These variants support autosomal recessive inheritance and have been included in this curation. There is insufficient data available to score segregation in this curation. The mechanism of pathogenicity is reported to be LOF.  \nThis gene-disease association is also supported by mouse and zebra fish animal models (PMIDs: 19000668, 20493458). In vitro functional assays in patient and non-patients cells were supportive for the role of IFT122 gene in the number and length of cilia (PMID: 20493458, 24689072) and reduced interaction with IFT-A subunits in cells with CED1 missense variants (PMID: 29220510). \nIn summary, IFT122 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive Cranioectodermal dysplasia 1 (OMIM:218330). This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time (2010 to 2021).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6c8b400b-9731-44cc-acf9-5675d05dda4d","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6e4b420a-5df1-4c3c-aca8-a5359de25a5d","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6e4b420a-5df1-4c3c-aca8-a5359de25a5d_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10060","date":"2021-10-21T04:10:58.353Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6e4b420a-5df1-4c3c-aca8-a5359de25a5d_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10060","date":"2021-10-21T04:09:41.926Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6e4b420a-5df1-4c3c-aca8-a5359de25a5d_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/754ca0e7-3dfc-4cf3-a551-76344eab821f_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/438d4134-36af-40d4-9187-66a0d030ae3e","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"NC_000003.12:g.129460947_129460957del (GRCh38) was reported in this article as NM_052985.3 c.366_376del p.Gly123Glufs*3.
