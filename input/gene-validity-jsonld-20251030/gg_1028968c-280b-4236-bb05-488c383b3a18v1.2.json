This disorder, which is also referred to as GAND, or GATAD2B-associated neurodevelopmental syndrome, is characterized by infantile hypotonia, feeding issues, developmental delay, severe ID, impaired speech, macrocephaly, gait abnormalities, abnormal brain MRI, delayed toilet training, strabismus, and dysmorphic facial features that include prominent forehead, hypertelorism, prominent/bulbous nasal tip, pointed chin. More than 50 cases have been described (PMIDs: 23644463, 23033978, 28077840, 30346093, 30482549, 32688057, 31949314, 25356899, 27159321, 31205050). Nonsense, frameshift, splice, intragenic deletions, and a small number of missense variants clustered in conserved region domains have been reported. Variants occurred de novo in the majority of cases, with a handful of reports of parental mosaicism. Seven variants that were reported in seven probands from five publications are included in this curation (PMIDs: 32688057, 30482549, 30346093, 28077840, 23644463). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of disease is known to be haploinsufficiency/loss of function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by a biochemical function in the NuRD complex shared with two other genes, *CHD3* and *CHD4*, that are associated with neurodevelopmental syndromes with overlapping features, impaired habituation, and altered synapse structure in a pan-neuronal knockdown Drosophila model, and evidence of disrupted NuRD protein-protein interactions for reported missense variants (PMIDs: 31949314, 23644463). In summary, *GATAD2B* is definitively associated with autosomal dominant severe intellectual disability, poor language, strabismus, grimacing face, long fingers syndrome. This relationship has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel on 2/1/2022 (SOP Version 8).

The CR1 motif is known to bind MBD2/3 NuRD subunits through the formation of a coiled coil. The CR2 region has been shown to interact with the C-terminal region of CHD4. To understand the effect of the GATAD2B missense variants in the context of NuRD assembly, the authors performed pairwise interaction experiments to assess the binding of GATAD2B to MBD or CHD proteins. Full-length HA-tagged GATAD2B (wildtype or missense variants) was co-expressed with either FLAG-tagged MBD2/3 or the FLAG-tagged C-terminal region of CHD proteins (the C1-C2 region that follows the helicase domain) and their interaction examined in pulldown experiments. The L180P variant abrogated the interaction of GATAD2B with both MBD2 and MBD3 (Fig. 4a). The L180 residue lies at the interface of the GATAD2-MBD coiled-coil, and the leucine to proline substitution is likely to disrupt both the interaction interface and the intrinsic helical propensity of the CR1 region. As compared to wild type GATAD2B, the CR2-region variants showed variable effects on the interactions between GATAD2B and the CHD paralogues (Fig. 4b). The C420R and C420S variants substantially inhibited these interactions with the CHD paralogues as compared to wild-type controls, whereas R414Q variant caused a mild reduction in these interactions. The G406R variant showed no clear effect.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31949314","rdfs:label":"missense variants functional effect"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5fb40641-ec79-4fee-9111-d38d2062c15b_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8af30f93-1b19-4f90-9774-f00f2da33de6","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Habituation was previously shown to be defective in classic learning and memory mutants and in a Drosophila model of ID.

Habituation in the mutant flies was assessed using short light-off stimuli (trials), 100 knock down mutant flies vs 100 controls. A significant deficit in habituation was observed; simj-RNAi flies habituated more slowly than controls and maintained a higher jump response throughout the course of the experiment (figure 3). The level of simj mRNA was efficiently downregulated to 29% upon induction by a ubiquitous actin-Gal4 driver (p=0.0024; two-tailed t test).
