This includes 17 missense variants and three splicing variants that have been reported in 11 publications (PMIDs: 28469040, 29845112, 30054183, 30337194, 33218681, 33618928, 34048612, 34099057, 29650794, 33589474, 33087501). Eight of these variants also had supporting functional data. Four variants were reported in multiple publications, with their second observation also scored to reach the maximum score for genetic evidence of 12 pts. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be gain of function. This gene-disease association is also supported by experimental evidence including expression studies, functional alterations in patient cells, rescue experiments in vitro and protein interactions (PMIDs: 28469040, 33218681, 34099057, 33087501). Notably, this includes the observation of ubiquitinated neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions positive for the ANXA11 protein with co-localisation with TDP-43 and p62 in post-mortem neuronal tissues from patients carrying three different ANXA11 variants. In summary, ANXA11 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant ALS. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen ALS GCEP on November 9, 2021 (SOP Version 8).

IHC of fibroblasts to show ANXA11 localisation after stimulation with a calcium ionophore, ionomycin, to augment intracellular concentration of Ca2+ (Fig. S2, B and C). Confirmed by biochemical fractionation experiments (fig. S2, D to F). Further replicated using GFP-tagged constructs in cell lines, where similar treatment resulted in H390P and R456H ANXA11 mutants robustly aggregated in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1, B and C). These mutants are located within the third and fourth ANX domains, which are responsible for Ca2+-dependent phospholipid binding (Fig. 1A), suggesting that these mutations may block binding to plasma and nuclear membrane phospholipids, thereby inhibiting the Ca2+-dependent functions of ANXA11.\nExamined the expression of ANXA11 mRNA and protein in patient bone marrow–derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) carrying the loss of function p.G228Lfs*29 variant.\nQuantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis revealed 38% reduced mRNA expression, and Western blot analysis only detected a normal-sized protein band with 49% reduced expression in BM-MSC cells, suggesting that no stable truncated protein was produced from mutant transcripts (Fig. 3, A and B).\n\n2. Fura-2 ratio calcium imaging of patient fibroblasts showed ANXA11 variant positive fibroblasts had significantly higher basal intracellular Ca2+ concentration than the healthy control fibroblasts (P < 0.0001) (Fig. 2, A and B), indicating that intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis was disrupted in patient fibroblasts. Next, estimated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ content by stimulating cells with the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+–adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) (SERCA) inhibitor thapsigargin (TG) (1 μM) in Ca2+-free medium. TG-induced Ca2+ release was significantly decreased in patient fibroblasts as compared to healthy control fibroblasts (P < 0.0001) (Fig. 2, A and C), indicating that there were lower concentration of ER Ca2+ in the fibroblasts of patients carrying ANXA11 missense variants. Also observed a corressponding increase in basal phosphorylation of the α subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (Fig. 2, D and E). \nIntracellular concentration of basal Ca2+ was increased (P < 0.0001), whereas TG-induced Ca2+ release was decreased in patient BM-MSCs as compared to healthy control BM-MSCs (P < 0.0001) (Fig. 3, C and D). We confirmed these data by ANXA11 knockdown (KD) in HeLa cells (Fig. 3, E to H).\n\n3.
