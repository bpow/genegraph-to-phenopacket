{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6e14e6fb-aef7-4c97-9e06-a60e6ffcf64bv1.2","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"The *RPE65* gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive cases of Leber congenital amaurosis or Retinitis pigmentosa in 1997 (Gu et al., PMID: 9326941, Marlhens et al., PMID: 9326927). Affected individuals have since been identified in a number of other publications (PMID: 9501220, PMID: 14962443, PMID: 11786058, PMID: 12960219, PMID: 15557452), with causal biallelic variants in *RPE65* specifically diagnostic for either Leber congenital amaurosis 2 (more severe) or Retinitis pigmentosa 20 (later onset). Both disease entities are completely penetrant, however, patients with Leber congenital amaurosis 2 present with severe visual impairment before the age of 5 (usually during the first year of life) while their counterparts with Retinitis pigmentosa 20 present with either severe visual impairment or nyctalopia between the ages of 3 and 7 and exhibit onset of severe vision loss between 3 and 40 years of age. While Leber congenital amaurosis 2 progresses to complete vision loss by the 3rd or 4th decade of life, the timing of this event is delayed in most patients with Retinitis pigmentosa 20. Patients with Leber congenital amaurosis 2 or Retinitis pigmentosa 20 also exhibit other eye-specific features, including nystagmus and sometimes chorioretinal atrophy. While electroretinogram (ERG) response is nondetectable in Leber congenital amaurosis patients, ERG responses can be either nondetectable or reduced in those with Retinitis pigmentosa 20. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found the molecular mechanism (biallelic loss of function in the *RPE65* gene product) and mode of inheritance (autosomal recessive) to be consistent among unrelated patients diagnosed with either Leber congenital amaurosis 2 or Retinitis pigmentosa 20, while the phenotypic variability between them appeared to represent a spectrum of disease rather than separate disease entities. Therefore, cases of Leber congenital amaurosis 2 or Retinitis pigmentosa 20 have been lumped into a single disease entity, referred to as recessive RPE65 retinopathy.  An additional disease entity, Retinitis pigmentosa 87 with choroidal involvement, was asserted in relation to a monoallelic variant in *RPE65*, specifically a substitution at codon 477 that encodes glycine rather than aspartic acid (PMID: 21654732, PMID: 27307694, PMID: 30628748, PMID: 29659842, PMID: 28041994, PMID: 29947567). While this disease entity is characterized by similar phenotypes with delayed onset (severe vision loss between ages 40 and 80), its different mode of inheritance and unique variant suggested a different mechanism of pathogenesis. Thus, *RPE65* was separately curated for its relationship to this disease entity, referred to as dominant *RPE65* retinopathy. Seventeen suspected pathogenic variants were scored as part of this curation (two nonsense, four frameshift, nine missense, and two disrupting splicing), which have been collectively reported in thirteen probands in three publications (PMID: 9326941, PMID: 9326927, PMID: 9501220). Four probands were homozygous for their respective variants (PMID: 9326941, PMID: 9501220), and one was reported to have consanguineous parents (PMID: 9326941). The nine other probands were compound heterozygotes within the *RPE65* locus (PMID: 9326941, PMID: 9326927, PMID: 9501220). Two families with segregation evidence were available in these publications (PMID: 9501220, PMID: 9326941), and contributed to the scoring of the gene-disease relationship. A third family with segregation evidence exhibited one inconsistent (heterozygous affected) individual and was not scored (PMID: 9326941). More case-level data was available (PMID: 14962443, PMID: 11786058, PMID: 12960219, PMID: 15557452), but was not scored as part of this curation as the maximum scoring for this evidence type had already been reached. This gene-disease relationship has been studied in a case-control study in which biallelic *RPE65* variants were found to be enriched in the case group relative to ethnicity-matched controls at the aggregate variant level (PMID: 30996589). The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be biallelic loss of function, characterized in some cases by frameshift or nonsense variants predicted to trigger a decrease in the amount of the gene product (PMID: 9326941, PMID: 9326927, PMID: 9501220). All probands found for this curation harbored two variant alleles within the *RPE65* locus. This gene-disease association is also supported by experimental evidence that *RPE65* expression is highly specific to the retinal pigment epithelium at both the mRNA level (PMID: 30239781) and protein level (PMID: 8474143). Biochemical studies have demonstrated that *RPE65* encodes the human isomerohydrolase enzyme, a critical component of the visual retinoid cycle that regenerates 11-cis retinal following the light-induced isomerization of this pigment to all-trans retinal (PMID: 16116091). This explains why homozygous *Rpe65* knockout mice exhibit accumulation of retinal esters in the retinal pigment epithelium (PMID: 9843205), photoreceptor outer segment loss (PMID: 9843205), lack of rod photoreceptor function (PMID: 9843205), and moderate defects in cone photoreceptor function (PMID: 9843205, PMID: 17251447). Swedish Briard / Briard Beagle dogs harbor a homozygous frameshift variant in the *RPE65* locus and recapitulate additional features of the human patients, including severe vision loss (PMID: 2804031), abnormal electroretinogram (PMID: 2804031), and structural abnormalities of the retinal pigment epithelium (PMID: 7851218). In summary, *RPE65* is definitively associated with recessive *RPE65* retinopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both research and diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time without the emergence of contradictory evidence, leading to a Definitive classification.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6e14e6fb-aef7-4c97-9e06-a60e6ffcf64b","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/375ffa04-a8d9-427e-8948-f913bc8ff68d","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/375ffa04-a8d9-427e-8948-f913bc8ff68d_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10072","date":"2022-05-24T21:43:21.458Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/375ffa04-a8d9-427e-8948-f913bc8ff68d_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10072","date":"2022-05-24T21:41:58.160Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/375ffa04-a8d9-427e-8948-f913bc8ff68d_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/28d65164-9d6e-410a-9756-8b0b39b2f284_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/28d65164-9d6e-410a-9756-8b0b39b2f284","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9326941","rdfs:label":"Gu_1997_Family_PMK30_Patient_V-5","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0c84c0ae-5940-4bfd-a09f-2ffd5b541796","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000329.3(RPE65):c.1087C>A (p.Pro363Thr)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA256730"}},"detectionMethod":"PCR products from the RPE65 locus were screened by single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis.

The mice exhibit progressively abnormal retinal morphology, reduced responses to dark-adapted ERG (characteristic of abolished rod function), and accumulation of retinal esters in the retinal pigment epithelium. The model matches the autosomal recessive mode of inheritance of the human disease entity, consistent with the hypothesized loss-of-function mechanism of pathogenicity. Scoring was slightly decreased from the default since the model lacks evidence of the cone photoreceptor dysfunction exhibited by human patients, but this shortcoming is complemented by scored evidence from a second, related mouse model (PMID: 17251447). Up-scoring was also not performed since the model disrupts the entire Rpe65 locus rather than introducing a mutation equivalent to a human patient variant.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/605f52a9-1307-42c9-a2b8-c5dddceee149","type":"Finding","dc:description":"The model system recapitulates the human phenotype in that the mice exhibit progressive onset of abnormalities in retinal morphology (specifically photoreceptor outer segment loss, Figures 2a-2e), accompanied by reduced responses in dark-adapted (Figure 4) but not light-adapted (Figure 5) ERG.
