NSDHL loss-of-function (LoF) variants cause CHILD syndrome in females and are usually lethal in males, while NSDHL hypomorphic variants cause CK syndrome in males and female carriers are typically unaffected. \n\n\nThus far, neurodevelopmental disorders such as intellectual disability or seizures have not been reported in individuals with a diagnosis of CHILD syndrome (PMIDs: 26014843, 16088165, 25533639, 15689440, 16549711, 25093865, 21753784, 29341259) but have been observed in CK syndrome. For this reason, the ID/Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel has opted to evaluate this gene’s relationship to CK syndrome; evidence related to NSDHL and CHILD syndrome is not considered here. \n\n\nVariants in NSDHL have thus far only been reported in 3 multigenerational families with the CK syndrome presentation; affected males share consistent features of intellectual disability, seizures, microcephaly, and dysmorphic facial features. Reported variants include  a frameshift in the last exon resulting in stop loss and extension (PMID: 19377476), and an in-frame deletion of a single amino acid in the original CK family (PMID: 21129721), both shown to be hypomorphic alleles (PMID: 21129721); and a missense variant with no functional studies (PMID: 25900314). Supportive segregation data is available in all three families. This gene-disease association is also supported by experimental evidence. NSDHL encodes an enzyme in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway and patient-derived lymphoblastoid cells have increased methyl sterol levels similar to those observed in CHILD syndrome (PMID: 21129721). Additional support is provided by a mouse model exhibiting abnormal cortical development (PMID: 21129721). In summary, there is moderate evidence supporting an association between NSDHL and X-linked CK syndrome. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel on 1/20/21 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6c7fcdba-6ee9-4245-89c6-0a5b2af86796","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d94406f0-a459-47ed-aabc-80c7b6be9293","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","changes":{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d94406f0-a459-47ed-aabc-80c7b6be9293_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2021-01-20T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d94406f0-a459-47ed-aabc-80c7b6be9293_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2021-03-22T18:04:17.164Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d94406f0-a459-47ed-aabc-80c7b6be9293_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d94406f0-a459-47ed-aabc-80c7b6be9293_seg_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ddda5fc6-0a1e-4d12-a295-40aa3b6c3754_proband_segregation","type":"FamilyCosegregation","dc:description":"Next

DNA from the first described family, two point linkage was performed an X chromosome single-nucleotide variant (SNV) scan of family members giving consent to the protocol (H07-02142), approved by the clinical research ethics board at the University of British Columbia. We identified linkage to Xq28 (Figure 1). Two-point linkage analysis was performed with MLink from the FASTLINK software package, version 4.0P,5 and the Allegro program, version 1.1b.6 Multipoint linkage analysis was performed with the Allegro program. The maximum two-point and multipoint LOD scores were, respectively, 1.43 (q ¼ 0) and 2.29 (q ¼ 0) with marker rs941400. Haplotype andmicrosatellite analysis narrowed the interval to 5 Mb, marker DXS1684 to the telomere (Figure 1). Analysis of the 36.5 NCBI build of the human genome sequence revealed 133 positional candidate genes, expressed sequence tags (ESTs), and noncoding RNAs annotated within this region. By long-range PCR we amplified 1,535,643 bp of genomic sequence containing 111,381 bp of coding sequence and used Illumina reversible terminator-based sequencing to sequence the amplicons. Sufficient sequence coverage for unambiguously identifying variants was obtained for 85.3%, 80.6%, and 87.5% of the coding sequence in individuals V-3, III-4, and IV-11, respectively (Figure S2). Analysis identified a total of 6200 SNVs and 581 indels (Figure 1). Of the SNVs, 5106 were not found in four reference genomes.7–10 Capillary resequencing of 44,925 bp confirmed 86% of the SNV and indel observations. Of the 1347 SNVs and one indel unique to the proband, one SNV and one indel met the following criteria: (1) is absent from dbSNP, (2) is confirmed by capillary sequencing, (3) changes an amino acid change, and (4) segregates with CKS. The SNV was a mutation in F8 (c.1064G>A [p.Arg355Gln]), which encodes the blood coagulation factor 8 associated with hemophilia A. However, this mutation was considered clinically irrelevant because these males do not have bleeding problems. The indel was in exon 7 of NAD(P) dependent steroid dehydrogenase-like (NSDHL [MIM 300275]) (NM 015922.1:c.696_698del [p.Lys232del]) (Figure 1). The NSDHL mutation was not observed in 150 North American control chromosomes or in the 357 genomes evaluated for indels as part of the 1000 Genomes Project.","firstTestingMethod":"Linkage analysis","phenotypeFreeText":"Speech delay, distinct facial abnormalities, skeletal abnormalities, long fingers and toes, optic atrophy","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0000286","obo:HP_0000347","obo:HP_0000252","obo:HP_0001250","obo:HP_0000582","obo:HP_0001249","obo:HP_0001252"],"secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ce463095-686e-44c3-b8a0-934a743468b4_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21129721","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/53897a19-510e-497c-a50a-3977a176041d","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_015922.3(NSDHL):c.693_695GAA[1] (p.Lys232del)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA341819"}},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"none"}}},"meetsInclusionCriteria":true,"phenotypeFreeText":"Speech delay, distinct facial abnormalities, skeletal abnormalities, long fingers and toes, optic atrophy","phenotypePositiveAllelePositive":4,"phenotypes":["obo:HP_0000486","obo:HP_0001250","obo:HP_0000286","obo:HP_0000347","obo:HP_0000582","obo:HP_0001249","obo:HP_0001252","obo:HP_0000252"],"proband":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/660ed6b1-8b13-4f40-a942-7b9f1698134f"},"publishedLodScore":1.43,"sequencingMethod":{"id":"cg:AllGenesSequencing"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValiditySegregationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d94406f0-a459-47ed-aabc-80c7b6be9293_ad_other_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3b69caf5-558b-4b75-aeb2-8b8dc757e43d_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Although there is no functional data available, the proband's phenotypes are consistent with CK syndrome and the variant segregates within the family.
