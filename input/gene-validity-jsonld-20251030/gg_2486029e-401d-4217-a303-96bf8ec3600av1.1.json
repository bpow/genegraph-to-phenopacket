BBS is a rare genetically heterogeneous ciliopathy, characterized by rod-cone dystrophy, polydactyly, obesity, genital anomalies, renal anomalies, and intellectual disabilities. *TTC8* variants have also been asserted in relation to non-syndromic cases diagnosed as retinitis pigmentosa (PMID: 20451172, PMID: 26195043). Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping & Splitting Working Group, the mode of inheritance (autosomal recessive) and molecular mechanism (biallelic *TTC8* loss of function) have been found to be consistent among patients diagnosed with either Bardet-Biedl syndrome 8 (MIM# 615985) or retinitis pigmentosa 51 (MIM# 613464), while the phenotypic variability between cases appears to represent a spectrum of disease rather than separate disease entities. Therefore, cases caused by inherited biallelic *TTC8* variants have been lumped into a single disease entity, referred to as TTC8-related ciliopathy.\n\nThis curation includes four variants (three disrupting splicing and one frameshift) that have been reported in five probands in three publications (PMIDs: 14520415, 16308660, 19797195). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be biallelic loss-of-function.\n\nThis gene-disease association is also supported by expression studies from Ansley et. al. showing that *TTC8* is expressed in the basal body of cilium, as BBS is known to be caused by dysfunction of primary cilia (PMID: 14520415). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments show that TTC8 protein co-localizes with PCM1 and BBS4, which are encoded by two genes that have previously been implicated in BBS. Finally, two *Ttc8* knockout mouse models by Kretschmer et. al. and Dilan et. al. show that absence of the Ttc8 protein in mice results in rapid and severe retinal degeneration as seen in human BBS patients (PMIDs: 30901771, 29126234).\n\nIn summary, *TTC8* is definitively associated with autosomal recessive TTC8-related ciliopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Retina GCEP on June 6, 2024 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2486029e-401d-4217-a303-96bf8ec3600a","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1ac205a8-bf9d-4c54-8d1c-c5d3af4b4aab","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1ac205a8-bf9d-4c54-8d1c-c5d3af4b4aab_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10072","date":"2025-01-04T01:40:43.572Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1ac205a8-bf9d-4c54-8d1c-c5d3af4b4aab_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10072","date":"2024-06-06T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["DiseaseNameUpdate"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1ac205a8-bf9d-4c54-8d1c-c5d3af4b4aab_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9953b03d-cd32-46f5-8a39-7804bec77e41_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9953b03d-cd32-46f5-8a39-7804bec77e41","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14520415","rdfs:label":"Ansley_BB12_II:1","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/54d2ee9e-7ece-4d8b-8c58-0c843e21acd3","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_144596.4(TTC8):c.1049+2_1049+4del","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA252322"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","previousTesting":false,"sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/16b12109-6ed9-4bb1-bd80-ef50cf91c747_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14520415","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/54d2ee9e-7ece-4d8b-8c58-0c843e21acd3"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"}}},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/16b12109-6ed9-4bb1-bd80-ef50cf91c747","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"score reduced due to lack of WES to rule out variants in other BBS genes.
