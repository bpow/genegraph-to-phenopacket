The LRPPRC gene encodes an important post-transcriptional regulator of mitochondrial gene expression and coordinates mitochondrial translation.\n\nThe LRPPRC gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Leigh syndrome spectrum in 2003 (PMID: 12529507). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included three unique variants (including two founder variants) identified in 11 cases from three publications (PMIDs: 12529507, 26510951, 21266382). No segregation data were available. Loss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease association is also supported by known biochemical function, expression, functional alteration in patient cells, animal models, and rescue in animal models (PMIDs: 27977873, 18853439, 20598281, 22821833, 27858754, 26380172). \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support this gene-disease relationship, including that more than three years have elapsed from the first proposal of the association. This classification was approved by NICHD U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on December 9, 2019 (SOP Version 7).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3c741c5e-aabc-478c-bf84-f9409a0912eb","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/79691365-1911-423c-ab14-73a1f509ed22","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/79691365-1911-423c-ab14-73a1f509ed22_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2019-12-19T19:01:57.942Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/79691365-1911-423c-ab14-73a1f509ed22_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/79691365-1911-423c-ab14-73a1f509ed22_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/79691365-1911-423c-ab14-73a1f509ed22_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/501d7772-f222-43a8-a7c1-ea0d17e5d0b9","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Biochemical/mitochondrial dysfunction (0.5) and growth retardation (early death) (0.5) in Drosophila co-ortholog KD model.

Increased sensitivity to Ca2+-induced permeability transition but no changes in reactive oxygen species production were also observed.

A significant decrease in basal oxygen consumption rate was observed in Patient 2 fibroblasts compared to the control cell line (Fig. 4A). Steady-state protein levels of subunits of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes in LRPPRC patient samples were analysed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Homozygous mutant LRPPRC (Patients 1 and 2) fibroblasts showed an almost complete loss of mitochondrial (COXI and COXII) and nuclear-encoded (COXIV) subunits of Complex IV (Fig. 5A). The steady-state levels of Complex I subunit proteins NDUFB8, NDUFA9 and NDUFA13 were also decreased in Patient 2 fibroblasts. Consistent with the reduced steady-state levels of Complex IV subunits in LRPPRC patient fibroblasts, mitochondrial protein extracts from muscle homogenates also revealed a significant decrease in the steady-state levels of COXI and COXII (Fig. 5B). In addition, slightly decreased levels of Complex I subunit proteins NDUFB8 and NDUFA9 were found in LRPPRC patients’ muscle homogenates, whilst the levels of Complex V and Complex III subunits remained unchanged (Fig. 5B). The assembly of OXPHOS complex subunits into mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes was subsequently analysed by blue native PAGE in LRPPRC patient fibroblasts and skeletal muscle. Blue native PAGE analysis showed a slight decrease of fully assembled Complex IV in Patient 1 and 2 fibroblasts and an almost complete lack of Complex IV in the muscle of Patient 2 (Fig. 5C). Patient muscle homogenates displayed decreased levels of Complex I, similar to previously published studies (Fig. 5C). Fibroblast and muscle samples from patients also showed decreased steady-state levels of mitochondrial mRNA transcripts (MTCO1, MTCO2, MTND1 and RNA14) (Fig. 6A).

Antenatal ultrasound had revealed coarctation of the aorta, although this was not haemodynamically significant when assessed postnatally. By 8 months he was noted to have generalized\nhypotonia and was failing to thrive. Beginning at 11 months, he has had repeated hospital admissions with pneumonia, lactic acidosis (up to 18 mmol/l) and ketonuria. Between episodes, plasma lactate concentrations remained elevated (2.5–6 mmol/l) and the acidosis was managed with sodium bicarbonate. With the exception of these acute exacerbations his clinical course has been stable. He fed slowly and, from 5 years, oral feeding has been supplemented via a gastrostomy. He has shown very slow developmental\nprogress and is still unable to sit without support at 8 years. He can manipulate and transfer objects using a palmar grasp, reaching non-preferentially with either hand. Vision and hearing appear normal, but communication is limited to crying. He is mildly dysmorphic, with a broad nasal bridge, mild hirsutism and microcephaly (50.4%). Repeat echocardiography showed bilateral superior vena cava but no other abnormalities. Plasma amino acid analysis showed raised alanine concentrations, while urine organic acids showed increased tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates. Neuroimaging findings: Congenital: Mega cisterna magna, Hypoplastic cerebellar vermis, Hypoplastic cerebellar tonsils, Unfolded hippocampi, Supratentorial central and cerebellar atrophy; Acquired:\nSymmetrical abnormal T2 signal in corpus callosum, corpus striatum and supratentorial subcortical white matter (U fibres) – also restricts on DWI, Symmetrical abnormal signal of dentate nuclei but no DWI changes, Thalami spared.
