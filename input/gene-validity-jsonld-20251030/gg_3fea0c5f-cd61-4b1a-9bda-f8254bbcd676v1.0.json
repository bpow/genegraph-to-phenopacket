SUCLA2 was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Leigh syndrome spectrum in 2005 (Epeleg et al., PMID 10545952).  More than 50 unique variants predicted to cause a loss of or reduced function of the protein have been reported in ClinVar, suggesting homozygous loss of function is the mechanism of disease for this gene. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 10 probands with Leigh syndrome spectrum in 9 different publications (PMID 17301081, 23010432, 10545952, 23759946, 26952923, 27913098, 17287286, 26475597, 25582465). This gene-disease association is further supported by the function of the gene product, protein interaction, expression, and studies in cell lines.  In summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between SUCLA2 and autosomal recessive Leigh syndrome spectrum. More than three years have elapsed from the first proposal of the association, thus reaching a definitive classification. This classification was approved by the NICHD U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on February 11, 2019 (SOP Version 6).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3fea0c5f-cd61-4b1a-9bda-f8254bbcd676","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/eedc8c99-a02a-4a34-ba72-1b0fc975e63f","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/eedc8c99-a02a-4a34-ba72-1b0fc975e63f_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2019-04-18T18:01:00.762Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/eedc8c99-a02a-4a34-ba72-1b0fc975e63f_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/eedc8c99-a02a-4a34-ba72-1b0fc975e63f_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/eedc8c99-a02a-4a34-ba72-1b0fc975e63f_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b252ded2-cdcc-455c-9bd8-4a2e51da6e2d","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Cell culture model with SUCLA2 knockdown was performed in a neuronal cell type providing increased evidence of its pathological relationship with Leigh syndrome.
