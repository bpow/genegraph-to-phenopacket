Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data from 8 probands in 3 publications (PMIDs: 20418530, 23388406, 24193343), with ten unique variants (including missense, in-frame deletions, frameshifts, and splice sites), having a loss of function mechanism. This gene-disease association is also supported by experimental evidence, including expression evidence (PMID: 7545970) in type IIa muscle fibers and a C. elegans model (PMID: 16130113).  In summary, *MYH2* is definitively associated with autosomal recessive proximal myopathy and ophthalmoplegia. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.\nOf note, *MYH2* has also been reported in relation to autosomal dominant proximal myopathy and ophthalmoplegia. Due to the proposed difference in mechanism, dominant negative, those cases were considered in a separate curation.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e1d335ec-aad5-4837-a9ce-3db0ac369d4a","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ba72d803-f94a-4036-88e5-3abae412c0da","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"},"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ba72d803-f94a-4036-88e5-3abae412c0da_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10031","date":"2024-07-24T14:09:49.029Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ba72d803-f94a-4036-88e5-3abae412c0da_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10031","date":"2024-06-10T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration","ErrorClarification"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ba72d803-f94a-4036-88e5-3abae412c0da_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8c6f717b-fe09-4511-91e5-54b6bc1bfa3a_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8c6f717b-fe09-4511-91e5-54b6bc1bfa3a","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24193343","rdfs:label":"Patient A","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":5,"allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bba9b1cf-b9a3-41bc-bf71-5286a5f65564","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_017534.6(MYH2):c.533C>T (p.Thr178Ile)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA186126"}},"detectionMethod":"Genomic DNA was extracted from frozen skeletal muscle or peripheral blood.
