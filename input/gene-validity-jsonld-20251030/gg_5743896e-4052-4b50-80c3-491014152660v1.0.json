Glycine encephalopathy is characterized by elevated levels of glycine in the cerebrospinal fluid and elevated glycine CSF/plasma ratios. Patients with classic glycine encephalopathy or nonketotic hyperglycinemia often present in the first few days of life with apneic epileptic encephalopathy, which progresses to coma and death or leads to absent  psychomotor development, cortical blindness, intractable epilepsy, peripheral spasticity, and central hypotonia. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. At least 7 variants (frameshift, nonsense, and missense) have been reported in 7 probands from 2 publications (PMID:33890291, PMID:36190515). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 1 additional family member. \n\nThe gene *GCSH* encodes the \"H-protein\" that is crucial to both mitochondrial one carbon metabolism, as well as essential bioenergetic enzymes. Specifically, the H protein is involved in the glycine cleavage system, which is the primary pathway for the catabolism of the amino acid glycine. Additionally, the H protein is involved in the lipoylation of pyruvate dehydrogenase and 2-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. This gene-disease association is further supported by its biochemical function in the glycine cleavage system (PMID:36190515), bulk tissue expression (PMID:23715323), functional alteration in COS7 cells (PMID:36190515), and a knockout mouse model (PMID:33569080), for which homozygous knock outs are embryonic lethal by E10.5. The gene-disease relationship is also supported by interaction with the protein products of *AMT* and *GLDC* (PMID:15355973). Biallelic variants in *AMT* and *GLDC* have been well documented in association with glycine encephalopathy. \n\nThis gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the UNC Biocuration core on xxx. The original classification was disputed due to the absence of human genetic evidence at the time. A classification of strong was reached on 1/27/2022 by the Aminoacidopathy GCEP.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5743896e-4052-4b50-80c3-491014152660","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d360db9d-24e7-415e-b4bc-59a2c6231189","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Strong","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d360db9d-24e7-415e-b4bc-59a2c6231189_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10011","date":"2023-02-10T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d360db9d-24e7-415e-b4bc-59a2c6231189_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10011","date":"2023-02-16T19:07:39.750Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d360db9d-24e7-415e-b4bc-59a2c6231189_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ace4f0ef-235c-47f4-b656-c5129ca6bfcb_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/29cfc024-6e5e-4d61-bd07-a8da682fdea5","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Absent from gnomAD.

However, null homozygous AMT or GLDC mice survive later to the perinatal stage or until shortly after birth. The authors posit that embryonic lethality in GCSH mice may highlight additional roles of GCSH outside of the glycine cleavage system, such as in bioenergetic enzymes, and that perhaps why individuals with biallelic GCSH variants are less often reported in association with glycine encephalopathy than AMT or GLDC, is due to earlier stage lethality.
