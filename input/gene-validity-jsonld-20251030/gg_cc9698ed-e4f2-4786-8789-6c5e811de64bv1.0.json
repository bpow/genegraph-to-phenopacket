This variant results from a combination in cis of the common c.146G>A; p.R49Q (rs4763876) and the rare missense c.145C>T; p.R49W (rs757476941) nucleotide substitution in APOLD1.\n\nThe mechanism of disorder is not completely clear, however, it has been proposed that loss of APOLD1 results in dysmorphic endothelial cells with reduced cell-cell junctions and increased permeability, potentially leading to a bleeding disorder.\nEvidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes genetic evidences (case-level data) and experimental evidences (expression; functional alteration in non-patient cells, non-human model organisms).\n\nSummary of Case Level Data: 1.5 POINTS \nVariants in this gene have been reported in 4 probands in 1 publication (PMID: 35638551). \nAffected patients show an unusual type of spontaneous and trauma-related bleeding defect as they have normal coagulation and platelet function test parameters and do not respond to classical treatment with tranexamic acid or platelet transfusion. The use of vasodilators or aspirin worsened their bleeding tendency, and they developed microcirculatory symptoms, such as livedo reticularis after the administration of desmopressin and Raynaud syndrome.\n\nSummary of Experimental Data: 3.5 POINTS \nRegard B et al. showed that APOLD1 is rapidly induced in endothelial cells of cerebral vessels by seizures. APOLD1 mRNA is expressed in capillaries and in the cells lining the inner surface of veins and arteries, suggesting expression by endothelial cells (PMID 15102925).\nStritt et al. showed that APOLD1 localizes to cell-cell junctions and Weibel-Palade bodies in endothelial cells and in platelet alpha granules (PMID 35638551). The same authors showed that APOLD1 silencing causes increase in cell size, altered shape, endothelial cell junction dismantling (reduction in the tight junction protein CLDN5 and PECAM1), markedly enhanced fibronectin fibrillogenesis and actin stress fiber formation, reminiscent of endothelial cell activation, and increased endothelial permeability to FITC-dextran.\nFan et al demonstrated that Apold1 KO mice show impaired angiogenesis in the ischemic stroke border zone (PMID:36933174).\n\nIn summary, we obtained limited association of APOLD1 with unclassified bleeding disorder.\n\nThis classification was approved by the ClinGen Hemostasis Thrombosis Working Group on DATE (SOP Version 10). \n\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cc9698ed-e4f2-4786-8789-6c5e811de64b","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3b8a1833-03a5-4e71-9f31-974fcd6443f6","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3b8a1833-03a5-4e71-9f31-974fcd6443f6_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2024-05-01T17:05:08.160Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3b8a1833-03a5-4e71-9f31-974fcd6443f6_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2024-02-05T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3b8a1833-03a5-4e71-9f31-974fcd6443f6_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3b8a1833-03a5-4e71-9f31-974fcd6443f6_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/72a169b9-a55d-4ffc-be49-77c4cb092ca4","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/28a90034-c758-47c9-a1c2-9848291655e6","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Stroke volume was similar in Apold1−/− and WT mice\n21 days after the stroke reduction in vascular area, branch numbers, and total length of the vascular network in Apold1 KO mice.
