The NDUFAF2 gene encodes NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) assembly factor 2. Defects of this protein lead to a complex I deficiency.\n\nThe NDUFAF2 gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Leigh syndrome spectrum in 2005 (PMID: 16200211). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included six unique variants identified in seven cases from five publications (PMIDs: 16200211, 18180188, 19384974, 20571988, 20818383). No segregation data were available. Loss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease association is also supported by biochemical function, expression data, and cell culture models (PMIDs: 27977873, 16200211, 25613900, 23702311). \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support this gene-disease relationship, including that more than three years have elapsed from the first proposal of the association. This classification was approved by the NICHD U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on April 20, 2020 (SOP Version 7).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a7ffb156-2d84-47b9-b6a4-99abc05ddbf9","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7c26c06d-17dc-4783-8145-5de35c9a73f5","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7c26c06d-17dc-4783-8145-5de35c9a73f5_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2020-11-23T19:37:03.831Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7c26c06d-17dc-4783-8145-5de35c9a73f5_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2020-11-23T19:36:34.959Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7c26c06d-17dc-4783-8145-5de35c9a73f5_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/15a117ff-df0b-4343-ab32-a23a3dac37ef_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Patient is homozygous for a nonsense mutation c.9G > A which introduces an early stop codon at position 3 of NDUFAF2 (p.Trp3X),","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d9fc1191-cc5e-44b8-8e5b-636ab4f30ced","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20571988","rdfs:label":"Herzer Index","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":26,"detectionMethod":"Genomic DNA was extracted from skeletal muscle homogenate by proteinase K treatment followed by phenol / chloroform extraction.
