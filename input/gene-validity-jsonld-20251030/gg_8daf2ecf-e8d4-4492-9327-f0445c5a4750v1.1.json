At least five unique variants (e.g. missense, in-frame indel, nonsense, frameshift, large deletion, etc) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data.\nA founder variant in this gene, D487N, was first characterized by Frosk et al as causative for an LGMD in a Hutterite population, stemming from Eastern Europe. A follow-up publication by Schoser et al (PMID:15786463) observed that Hutterite LGMD probands and German sarcotubular myopathy probands shared this same variant and similar phenotypic features, concluding that both were part of the same spectrum of disorder. Since this initial characterization, several isolated variants have been reported in at least five other probands in four publications (PMIDs: 17994549, 19492423, 19303295, 31309175). In the initial pubication the D487N variant also segregated with disease in 18 additional probands in four families, yielding a maximum LOD score of 7.61. \nThe mechanism for disease appears to be biallelic loss of function, with the disruption of the c-terminal NHL repeats impacting protein interactions and affecting proteins important to the skeletal muscle. However, no exact protein has been implicated. \nOf note, a variant in the TRIM32 B-box domain has also been implicated in Bardet-Biedl Syndrome. Due to the significant phenotypic and mechanistic differences, this assertion will be assessed separately.\nThis gene-disease association is primarily supported by multiple animal models, with both a TRIM32 Knock-Out model and a D487N Knock-In model recapitulating phenotypes of the human probands such as muscle weakness and atrophy.\nIn summary, TRIM32 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive limb-girdle muscular dystrophy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy GCEP on Nov. 5, 2020 (SOP Version 7).\n\nThis gene curation was re-approved and published on 11/14/24 by the Muscular Dystrophies and Myopathies GCEP to reflect the change in the panel's name from LGMD GCEP to MDM GCEP. As part of this process, the genetic evidence was re-scored in accordance with SOP version 11.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8daf2ecf-e8d4-4492-9327-f0445c5a4750","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fbabe4ea-579e-4d98-a4b7-5ff84ee7f245","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":[{"id":"cg:expertPanelChange"},{"id":"cg:sopChange"},{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fbabe4ea-579e-4d98-a4b7-5ff84ee7f245_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10151","date":"2024-11-14T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fbabe4ea-579e-4d98-a4b7-5ff84ee7f245_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10151","date":"2024-11-14T20:28:15.359Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["ErrorClarification"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fbabe4ea-579e-4d98-a4b7-5ff84ee7f245_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8931401d-68e4-4b2d-9b63-2c21d44b1692_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8931401d-68e4-4b2d-9b63-2c21d44b1692","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19303295","rdfs:label":"CO","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1c333f78-1572-42ed-8b0b-301cdc1bc63a","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NC_000009.12:g.116699495_116699508dup (GRCh38)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA1139532461"}},"detectionMethod":"The dystrophin coding exons were sequenced with no mutation identified.
