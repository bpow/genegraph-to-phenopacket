The *MT-ND2* gene encodes the NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) core subunit ND2. Defects of this protein lead to complex I deficiency.\n\n*MT-ND2* was first reported in relation to maternally-inherited primary mitochondrial disease in 2001 (PMID: 11479733) in a family with Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON), however current population data suggests the variant reported in this case (m.4640C>A) is benign, so this case was excluded from this gene curation. Other associated features have been reported over time. While various names have been given to the constellation of features seen in those with *MT-ND2*-related disease, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *MT-ND2* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework. Of note, *MT-ND2* was first curated by this GCEP for its association with Leigh syndrome spectrum (LSS) on April 14, 2021 (SOP v8), with a final classification of limited. This current curation for the association with primary mitochondrial disease includes cases with LSS.\n\nEvidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included three unique variants (m.4681T>C, p.L71P; m.4810G>A, p.W114*; m.5132_5133del, fs) in three probands across three publications (PMIDs: 16738010, 15781840, 12192017). Single fiber testing and cybrid studies further supported the pathogenicity of several of these variants (PMIDs: 15781840, 16996290). Age of onset in affected individuals ranged from 9 months old to childhood. Clinical features in affected individuals included Leigh syndrome spectrum, myopathy, ophthalmoplegia, and ptosis. Muscle biopsies revealed ragged red fibers and complex I deficiency. Metabolic screening labs showed elevated lactate and creatine kinase (CK). Heteroplasmy levels were >95% in blood, fibroblasts, and muscle in the individual with Leigh syndrome spectrum. However in the other two individuals with predominantly myopathic features, the variant was present at >94% in muscle and undetectable in other tissues tested.\n\nThe mechanism of disease appears to be loss of function.  This gene-disease association is further supported by a known biochemical function shared with other genes associated with primary mitochondrial disease and a drosophila model (PMIDs: 33340416, 25085991).\n\nIn summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on May 18, 2023 (SOP Version 9).
