{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f963bfe7-9793-4da7-9b34-963c90be7bb7v1.1","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"CLCN7 was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant CLCN7-related osteopetrosis in 2001 (Bénichou et al.: PMID: 11468688). The condition is characterized by increased bone density leading to bone fragility, as well as the \"rugger jersey spine\" and \"bone within bone\" on iliac wings, as evident in radiographs. AD CLCN7-related osteopetrosis is associated with reduced penetrance and a milder phenotype than the recessive form. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found differences in phenotypic variability and inheritance pattern between disease assertions. Therefore, the following entities have been split into multiple disease entities: autosomal dominant osteopetrosis 2 (OMIM: 166600); autosomal recessive osteopetrosis 4 (OPTB4, OMIM: 611490); and autosomal dominant Hypopigmentation, Organomegaly, and Delayed Myelination and Development (HOD; OMIM: 618541). The split curations for autosomal recessive OPTB4 and autosomal dominant HOD have been curated separately. 12 variants (missense, frameshift) that have been reported in 37 probands in 7 publications (PMIDs: 11468688, 11741829, 21947783, 21962762, 30229577, 30942407, 36051116) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is reported to be dominant negative. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence, including mouse models showing increased bone density in mutants (PMIDs: 24185277, 28942122). In summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between CLCN7 and autosomal dominant osteopetrosis. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Skeletal Disorders GCEP on the meeting date 12/4/23 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f963bfe7-9793-4da7-9b34-963c90be7bb7","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/23840c1f-9d30-4ccf-9fc0-604a0cb12eb4","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/23840c1f-9d30-4ccf-9fc0-604a0cb12eb4_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10065","date":"2024-01-22T17:51:10.111Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/23840c1f-9d30-4ccf-9fc0-604a0cb12eb4_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10065","date":"2023-12-04T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"The genetic evidence should total 12.6 pts., with the maximum of 12.0 pts. counted (not 10.6 pts.), as I upgraded 2.0 pts.
