Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found differences in molecular mechanism, inheritance pattern, and phenotypic variability. Therefore, fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva and congenital heart disease have been split as two separate disease entities. Two unique missense variants have been reported in two probands in one publication (PMIDs: 19506109). The gene-disease relationship is supported by a knockout mouse models that show *Acvr1*-mutant mice display cardiovascular defects including persistent truncus arteriosus, abnormal maturation of the aortic arch, aortic stenosis, and atrioventricular septal defects (PMIDs:15226263, 22536403, 16140292). In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship.
