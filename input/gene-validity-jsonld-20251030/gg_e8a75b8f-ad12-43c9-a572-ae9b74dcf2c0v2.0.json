PEX19 encodes a peroxisome membrane protein involved in early peroxisome membrane biosynthesis prior to matrix protein import. Peroxisomal biogenesis disorders are caused by defects in various stages of peroxisomal protein import and/or peroxisome biogenesis, involving at least 14 PEX genes. PEX19 belongs to complementation group J and mutations in the gene result in cells devoid of peroxisomal remnants (Waterham and Ebberink 2012, PMID 22871920) or with a small number of enlarged peroxisomes (Ebberink et al, 2010, PMID 20647552).\n\nPEX19 was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Peroxisome biogenesis disorder in 1999. (Matsuzono et al, PMID: 10051604). At least 3 nonsense or frameshift variants have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data.  \n   \nSummary of Case Level Data (12 points):\nVariants in this gene have been reported in at least 5 probands in 5 publications (PMID: 10051604, 20683989, 21031596, 30561787, 36931687). Variants in this gene segregated with 4 additional family members. The mechanism for disease is expected to be homozygous loss of function.  \n  \nSummary of experimental data (4 points):\nThis gene-disease association is supported by in vitro functional assays (PMIDs 21669930, 28526747, 12096124, 10051604). PEX19 interacts with PEX3, PEX11B and PEX16. \n  \nIn summary, the PEX19-peroxisome biogenesis disorder gene-disease relationship is definitive. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Peroxisomal Disorders GCEP on January 17, 2020 (SOP Version 7). This gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the Peroxisomal Disorders on January 17, 2020. It was reevaluated on April 27, 2023. As a result of this reevaluation, the classification did not change. The genetic evidence was updated and scored according SOP v9 and a new case report added, which maxed out the genetic evidence score.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e8a75b8f-ad12-43c9-a572-ae9b74dcf2c0","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fa073c77-0623-4e82-b5b2-9fcd0eb0dc6e","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":[{"id":"cg:newEvidence"},{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"},{"id":"cg:sopChange"},{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},{"id":"cg:classificationChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fa073c77-0623-4e82-b5b2-9fcd0eb0dc6e_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10049","date":"2023-04-27T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fa073c77-0623-4e82-b5b2-9fcd0eb0dc6e_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10049","date":"2023-04-27T22:22:37.792Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"Unpublished data on individual with PEX19 variant contributes 0.5 points to the genetic evidence.

Per HGVS, this variant is c.763dup.","calculatedScore":4,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b131c186-ebc2-4b8b-bbac-19f5cb58aa9d_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b131c186-ebc2-4b8b-bbac-19f5cb58aa9d_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"The authors note that back transfection of the variant cDNA to patient fibroblasts as well as PEX-19 CHO-cell mutant did not restore peroxisome biosynthesis, indicating that the variant is inactivating.","functionalDataSupport":"Yes"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":4}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria","strengthScore":3},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d58f2ddb-cd4a-483b-a8df-2298367f97a1_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d58f2ddb-cd4a-483b-a8df-2298367f97a1","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20683989","rdfs:label":"Mohamed_Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDeath","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":16,"allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d664b4b5-4e2b-4d91-893c-4bcdeb804da4","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_002857.4(PEX19):c.320del (p.Lys107SerfsTer13)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/30062"}},"detectionMethod":"The authors mention that mutation analysis of the PEX19 gene was performed.","phenotypeFreeText":"Proband had an Apgar score of 6 and 8 at 1 and 5 min. Birth weight = 2.58 kg. She was noted to be inactive on the first day of life. She also had widely open posterior fontanele, absent Moro reflex, inconsistent rooting, absent palmar grasp. Her weight, length, and head circumference were at the 3rd centile. Systolic murmur was noted at the left sternal border. Tests for ammonia, lactate, TORCH screen, chromosomes, serum amino acids, acylcarnitine, and urine organic acids were normal. CT scan of the brain showed diffuse bilateral changes involving the frontotemporal and parieto‐occipital regions, and small bilateral intraventricular hemorrhage in the posterior horns of the lateral ventricles. EEG showed diffuse disturbance of cerebral activity dysynchronization and depression with a sharp transient wave over the central and temporal region. Patient fibroblasts showed deficient activity of DHAPAT, abnormal VLCFA and pristanic acid β‐oxidation, deficient phytanic acid α‐oxidation and abnormally processed acyl‐CoA oxidase and peroxisomal thiolase.\n\nPlasma peroxisomal functions:\n\nC22:0 = 20.8 µmol/L (control: 21–103 µmol/L); C24:0 = 48.2 µmol/L (control: 22–87 µmol/L); C26:0 = 9.72 µmol/L (control: 0.05–1.97 µmol/L); C24:0/C22:0 = 3.32 (control: 0–1.15); C26:0/C22:0 = 0.467 (control: 0–0.028); Phytanic acid = 1.6 (control: 0–10 µmol/L); Pristanic acid = 0.31 (control: 0-1 µmol/L)","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0030799","obo:HP_0010722","obo:HP_0000286","obo:HP_0001254","obo:HP_0001612","obo:HP_0000331","obo:HP_0002059","obo:HP_0002910","obo:HP_0007162","obo:HP_0000431","obo:HP_0009553","obo:HP_0000629","obo:HP_0010759","obo:HP_0006801","obo:HP_0008167","obo:HP_0000448","obo:HP_0001631","obo:HP_0002908","obo:HP_0000278","obo:HP_0000325","obo:HP_0008947","obo:HP_0008282","obo:HP_0000260","obo:HP_0001643","obo:HP_0000267","obo:HP_0002033"],"previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"Immunoflorescence microscopy with antibody against catalase in patient fibroblasts showed absence of peroxisomes.
