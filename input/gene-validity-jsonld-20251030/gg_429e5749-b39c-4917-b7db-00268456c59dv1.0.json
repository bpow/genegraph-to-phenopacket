At least 2 unique variants (frameshift and splice) have been reported in humans. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 3 probands in 2 publications (PMID: 23348741, 28958982). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 4 additional family members. The mechanism for disease is homozygous loss of function. This gene-disease association is supported by mouse models and expression studies (PMID: 23348741). In summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease association. While more evidence is needed to establish this association definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hearing Loss Working Group on 2/6/2020.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/429e5749-b39c-4917-b7db-00268456c59d","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7ba8e80d-ccfe-4c9d-a2a9-6abaa9dfacc6","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7ba8e80d-ccfe-4c9d-a2a9-6abaa9dfacc6_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2020-02-06T17:10:16.249Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7ba8e80d-ccfe-4c9d-a2a9-6abaa9dfacc6_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7ba8e80d-ccfe-4c9d-a2a9-6abaa9dfacc6_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7ba8e80d-ccfe-4c9d-a2a9-6abaa9dfacc6_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/52d2c91e-fa39-4cd0-94f3-39a2813d1b80","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Upgraded the animal model for accurate phenotype as well as inheritance pattern for human disorder.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/904335fa-e16c-414c-ba40-0dd767b8b27f","type":"Finding","dc:description":"progressive hearing loss was seen both in humans with the SYNE4 frameshift variants as well as these mice with the NESP4 variant which is the mouse analog of human SYNE.
