SON plays a critical role in cell cycle progression affecting RNA splicing as a splicing cofactor (PMID: 34521999).\n\nA *de novo* frameshift variant (c.5753_5756delTTAG) in *SON* was first reported in 2015 in a 5-year-old female with developmental delay, seizures, minor dysmorphisms, macrocephaly, brain white matter abnormalities, intestinal atresia, and ventriculoseptal defect (PMID: 25590979). However, it was not until 2016 when additional *SON* variants were detected in several unrelated probands (PMID: 27256762) that a new autosomal dominant, multisystem/intellectual disability syndrome would be recognized and subsequently named ZTTK (Zhu-Tokita-Takenouchi-Kim) syndrome (PMIDs: 27256762, 27545676, 27545680).\n\nSince 2016, more than 50 probands identified with loss-of-function *SON* variants (frameshift, nonsense, missense, inframe deletion) have been reported. All reported variants are *de novo* and located within exon 3. The c.5753_5756delTTAG variant is recurrent and has been reported in 13 individuals (PMID: 34521999). While the clinical presentation is variable, all individuals have some degree of developmental delay/intellectual disability.\n\nFive de novo heterozygous variants found in six probands reported in three publications (PMIDs: 27256762, 27545676, 34521999) are included in this curation. These five variants are either nonsense or frameshift, supporting a hypothesized disease mechanism of haploinsufficiency. Of note, two additional probands are available from the Brain Gene Registry (braingeneregistry.wustl.edu); one variant is the recurrent frameshift c.5753_5756delTTAG (ClinVar SCV: SCV003931201.1), but the other variant (c.384delA) is not formally documented in this curation due to technical limitations. While more evidence is available in the literature, the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached.\n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence. A *son* knockdown zebrafish model demonstrated multiple anomalies including spinal malformations, head and eye malformations with brain edema, and other unspecified developmental abnormalities, recapitulating the phenotype of ZTTK syndrome (PMID: 27545680).\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between *SON* and autosomal dominant ZTTK syndrome. This classification was approved by the Intellectual Disability and Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel on August 24, 2023 (SOP version 9).\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1676c853-7e92-4bc9-a6ad-6e63d2eab656","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b7e86b1d-154a-40b5-b454-fad392f87782","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b7e86b1d-154a-40b5-b454-fad392f87782_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2023-08-24T06:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b7e86b1d-154a-40b5-b454-fad392f87782_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2024-07-23T17:50:00.152Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["ErrorClarification"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b7e86b1d-154a-40b5-b454-fad392f87782_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/03c5059e-02d4-479c-a156-04e47592a289","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/03c5059e-02d4-479c-a156-04e47592a289_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27545676","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/abc5ce0e-1dd6-47a1-8b09-bca68b71624c","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_138927.4(SON):c.3073dup
