However, this variant has a total minor allele frequency of 0.001525 in the general population, is particularly common among the African/African American alleles, with a Grpmax Filtering Allele Frequency of 0.02622, and is observed in thirty homozygotes (Genome Aggregation Database v4.1). To date, no additional *PIK3R5* variants have been reported in relation to autosomal recessive ataxia-oculomotor apraxia. Additional human cases of *PIK3R5*-related ataxia have not been found in the literature. A recent cohort study of 52 patients affected by autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia with oculomotor apraxia did not detect any variants in *PIK3R5* (PMID: 35426160). This gene-disease relationship is supported by expression studies by Al Tassan *et al.* who demonstrated ubiquitous expression of the PIK3R5 gene in human tissues with high expression in the brain (PMID: 22065524). To date, no publications in scientific literature can be found indicating protein function studies or non-human models showing the ocular motility or coordination and movement deficient phenotype observed in human patients with ataxia-oculomotor apraxia. In summary, the evidence supporting the relationship between *PIK3R5* and autosomal recessive ataxia-oculomotor apraxia has been disputed and no valid evidence remains to support the claim. More evidence is needed to either support or entirely refute the role *PIK3R5* plays in this disease. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Cerebellar Ataxia GCEP on the meeting date April 9, 2025 (SOP Version 11).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ce05fc3b-3bbb-4efb-ae61-be05a51e1f4e","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9876210c-07d1-48c9-997f-da98db372e14","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9876210c-07d1-48c9-997f-da98db372e14_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10155","date":"2025-04-10T14:35:10.697Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9876210c-07d1-48c9-997f-da98db372e14_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10155","date":"2025-04-09T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"The allele frequency of the single variant reported in PIK3R5-related autosomal recessive ataxia-oculomotor apraxia is common in the general population, particularly among the African/African-American population, and observed in 30 homozygotes (gnomAD v4.1).
