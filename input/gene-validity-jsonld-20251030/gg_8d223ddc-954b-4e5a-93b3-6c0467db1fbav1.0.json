The phenotypes associated with LITAF/SIMPLE variants include distal muscle weakness, pes cavus, decreased motor and sensory nerve conduction velocities, and impaired vibration or pain sensation in the lower limbs. At least 15 unique missense variants have been reported in humans, with few other types of mutations reported. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in over 25 probands in 6 different publications, although no confirmed de novo or null variants have been observed in the literature (PMIDs: 24880540, 19541485, 28211240, 16787513, 15776429, 12525712). Variants in this gene also segregated with disease in over 50 additional family members across seven different families. This gene-disease relationship is supported by expression studies, functional studies, and an animal model. LITAF/SIMPLE was once predicted to have a role in protein degradation pathways, however recent research has shown that it is instead a zinc-binding membrane protein that embeds itself with an anchor located within the LITAF domain where most of the pathogenic mutations cluster (PMID: 27927196). Additionally, LITAF/SIMPLE is present in both developing and adult rat/mouse schwann cells and not in the axons supporting a demyelinating neuropathy phenotype (PMID:12525712). In summary, LITAF/SIMPLE is MODERATELY associated with autosomal dominant Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Charcot Marie Tooth Gene Curation Expert Panel on Apr 7, 2020.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8d223ddc-954b-4e5a-93b3-6c0467db1fba","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e7106097-314c-487a-9770-b7dea3f25f37","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e7106097-314c-487a-9770-b7dea3f25f37_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10063","date":"2020-04-07T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e7106097-314c-487a-9770-b7dea3f25f37_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10063","date":"2020-09-16T19:23:27.413Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e7106097-314c-487a-9770-b7dea3f25f37_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e7106097-314c-487a-9770-b7dea3f25f37_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/264e9cd0-9ead-4732-a836-c041e777b78a","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Although the mice with the expressed transgene do display signs clearly indicative of CMT1, the lack of specificity in the transfection and the promoter used do not allow for a preponderance of evidence to be met particularly as the heterozygous mice showed significantly less of a phenotype than the homozygous for an Autosomal Dominant disorder.

Phenotypically, both homozygous W116G and heterozygous mice showed general signs of muscle weakness and abnormal clenching signs upon tail hanging, suggestive of abnormal motor function. Impaired motor performance in the rotarod test was also noted in both compared to the controls, and a decrease in the tail-flick test showed reduced sensory perception. Further investigation revealed decreases in both motor and sensory nerve conduction velocities in both lines of mice, as well as decreased CMAPs, with SIMPLE WT transgenic mice displaying none of the aforementioned symptoms showing clear deficits that are consistent with human CMT. Histological analysis of sciatic nerves and ventral/dorsal roots revealed a demyelinating phenotype in the homozygous W116G mice with abnormal myelin infolding more prominent in the sciatic nerves. The axon caliber/area was much smaller than that of non-transgenic controls but no axon loss was noted. Analysis displayed that these axons with infoldings were displaced or deformed causing axonal damage and degeneration. The aforementioned loops were determined to likely physically block proper axonal transport leading to the degeneration and phenotypes observed in the mice and humans. This is further supported by microscopic analysis of different ages of mice that show the myelin infoldings precede the axonal defects in the mouse cells.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23359569","rdfs:label":"Transgenic W116G Mouse Model","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e7106097-314c-487a-9770-b7dea3f25f37_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cf338c85-eabb-4102-8183-e6916f472d0c","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"This experiment shows a clearly altered protein when the hydrophobic helical region or the known pathogenic mutant V144M is expressed in the cells.
