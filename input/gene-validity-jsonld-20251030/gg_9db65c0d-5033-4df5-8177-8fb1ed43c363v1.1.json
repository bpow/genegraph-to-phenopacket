The disease has symptoms of small serum magnesium concentrations, reduced urinary tubular magnesium reuptake, seizures, and moderately inhibited intellectual development. One variant (missense) that has been reported in two probands from one family in one publication (PMID: 17671655) is included in this curation. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss-of-function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence. For instance, GTEx expression data shows high expression in the medulla and cortex of kidney. Also, functional evidence demonstrates reduced renal magnesium channel activity associated with inhibiting EGFR, the receptor of EGF (PMID: 17671655). In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Tubulopathy GCEP on the meeting date 10/19/2023 (SOP Version 9).
