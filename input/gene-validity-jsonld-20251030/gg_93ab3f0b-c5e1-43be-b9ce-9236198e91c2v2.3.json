The relationship between *KMT2C* and syndromic intellectual disability (ID) was first reported in 2012 (Kleefstra et al., PMID: 22726846) in one individual from a cohort of patients with features of Kleefstra syndrome, which is characterized by ID, childhood hypotonia, and distinctive facial features. The affected individual harboured a heterozygous nonsense variant of unknown inheritance. Since then, at least eight *de novo* variants (3 nonsense, 4 frameshift and 1 deletion encompassing the entire gene) have been reported with detailed phenotypic descriptions (PMIDs: 29069077, 29276005). Affected individuals presented with a range of ID, language and motor delay, and mild dysmorphic features, some of which resemble Kleefstra-like facial dysmorphisms; additional features include microcephaly in 6 individuals and childhood hypotonia in 4 individuals. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or autistic traits were noted in three males and one female (PMIDs: 29069077, 29276005). Numerous truncating, mostly de novo variants in *KMT2C* have also been reported in large cohort studies of ASD or ID (PMIDs: 21658581, 27824329, 28263302, 31981491, 33057194). The disease mechanism is haploinsufficiency.\n\nThe gene-disease relationship is supported by experimental evidence of *KMT2C* interactions with proteins in the COMPASS complex implicated in ID (e.g., *KMT2D, KDM6A*), and by a knockout model of the *KMT2C* fly ortholog *trr* showing deficits in short term memory and learning (PMID: 28605393). \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between *KMT2C* and autosomal dominant syndromic intellectual disability. This was approved by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel on March 2, 2022 (SOP Version 8).\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/93ab3f0b-c5e1-43be-b9ce-9236198e91c2","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e1dcdd6c-30e0-4d06-8df5-f120b1b02477","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e1dcdd6c-30e0-4d06-8df5-f120b1b02477_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2022-03-02T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e1dcdd6c-30e0-4d06-8df5-f120b1b02477_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2022-09-15T16:38:40.672Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e1dcdd6c-30e0-4d06-8df5-f120b1b02477_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e1dcdd6c-30e0-4d06-8df5-f120b1b02477_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4b1fe802-763d-44cd-a2a1-6a18c7c4383c","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"KTM2C directly interacts with proteins such as UTX with implications in intellectual disability.
