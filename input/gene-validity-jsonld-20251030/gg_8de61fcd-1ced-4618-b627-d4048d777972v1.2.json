{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8de61fcd-1ced-4618-b627-d4048d777972v1.2","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"*B9D2* was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive ciliopathy in 2011 (PMID: 21763481). This disease is associated with renal/biliary dysplasia, abnormal nervous system development, ciliation issues, and fetal death. This disorder is characterized by abnormal development/structure of cilia and renal malformations/cysts. The *B9D2* gene encodes one of the three B9D-containing proteins, which all interact with the basal body and primary cilia in mammalian cells. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in molecular mechanism, inheritance pattern, or phenotypic variability. Therefore, the following disease entities have been lumped into one disease entity (autosomal recessive Ciliopathy): Meckel Syndrome 10 (OMIM: # 614175) and Joubert Syndrome 34 (OMIM # 614175). \n\nFive variants (all missense) that have been reported in 4 probands in 3 publications (PMIDs: 21763481, 31411728, 26092869) are included in this curation. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss of function. Three of the variants were homozygous, and one of them had functional evidence in the form of mass spectrometry showing impaired interaction with *MSK1*. The fourth proband was a compound heterozygous case where both variants were shown to impact transition zone targeting and localization. All variants that exhibited functional evidence were upgraded. \nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence (a mouse model, expression studies, interaction evidence, functional alteration evidence; PMIDs: 17127412, 21422230, 18287022, 19208769). The mouse model showed that mice with homozygous deletions in *B9D2* had defective ciliation in their kidneys (PMID: 18287022). Expression level evidence in C. elegans and human nasal polyps or turbinates showed expression in the ciliary transition zone, and that levels of ciliation are positively correlated with *B9D2* expression (PMIDs: 17127412, 21422230). The C. elegans study also demonstrated colocalization of *B9D1*, *B9D2*, *NPHP1*, and *NPHP4*. *B9D1* is definitive for autosomal recessive ciliopathy and *NPHP1* and *NPHP4* are definitive for autosomal recessive nephronophthisis 1 and autosomal recessive nephronophthisis 4, respectively. Functional alteration evidence in the form of RNAi inhibition in P. Tetraulia and IMCD3 cells shows that insufficient *B9D2* leads to defective ciliogenesis (PMIDs: 17127412, 19208769). \n\nWhile there is limited genetic evidence, a good deal of experimental evidence is available. In summary, there is “Moderate” evidence overall supporting the relationship between *B9D2* and autosomal recessive Ciliopathy. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Kidney Cystic and Ciliopathy Disorders GCEP on 06/12/2023 (SOP Version 9).\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8de61fcd-1ced-4618-b627-d4048d777972","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ebe1140c-09cc-4d05-8886-5a78267afe65","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","changes":{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ebe1140c-09cc-4d05-8886-5a78267afe65_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10066","date":"2023-06-12T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ebe1140c-09cc-4d05-8886-5a78267afe65_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10066","date":"2023-10-11T15:10:58.772Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"Genetic evidence should be 6.8 (we were more conservative with scoring homozygous cases, as noted in the genetic evidence sections including those variants).

Human nasal polyps or turbinates were taken out via surgical procedures, and epithelial cells were separated from the tissue by pronase. After being cultured for two weeks in flasks with collagen gels, the cells were released and put on a continuously rotating shaker (80 rpm) and cell sheets formed stable aggregates (epithelial spheroids). During the latter part of the procedure, epithelial cells polarized and differentiation of a portion of them into secretory and ciliated cells took place. The relative amounts of differentiated cell types was analyzed with western blot or flow cytometry with certain antibodies. Total RNA was taken from the primary culture of epithelial cells given or not given IL-13 at day 11 during differentiation. The RNA was reverse transcribed and PCR was done. This process allowed for the identification of B9D2, which is upregulated while mucociliary differentiation is taking place and gene expression is proportional to the percentage of cells that are ciliated. This gene is localized in the TGF-beta1 promoter and has ubiquitous expression in human cell types.
