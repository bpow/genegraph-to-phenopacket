The variants were primarily identified in individuals with limited phenotype data from large cohort studies, and none had experimental evidence of gene impact (21572417: O'Roak et al. 2011; 23160955: O’Roak et al. 2012; 27525107: Yuen et al. 2016; 28965761: Turner et al. 2017; 28191889: Stessman et al. 2017; 30564305: Guo et al. 2018; 31398340: Ruzzo et al. 2019). Recent large-scale case-control studies also failed to identify a significant association between variation in the gene and autism spectrum disorder (31398340: Ruzzo et al. 2019; 31981491: Satterstrom et al. 2020). A potential mechanism of disease has not been delineated, and no experimental data were identified that provided specific support for this gene-disease relationship.

More evidence is needed to either support or refute the role LAMC3 plays in this disease.

LAMC3 transcripts were first detected after mid-gestation, and expression peaked during an interval extending from late fetal development to late infancy (12 months) (Fig. 4a), coinciding with the period of cortical organization that takes place after neural stem cell proliferation and migration of postmitotic neurons to the cortical plate. Subcellularly, LAMC3 primarily localizes to the soma and apical dendrite of pyramidal neurons (Fig. 4b,c and Supplementary Fig. 7) and is barely detected along or near the axons (Fig. 4d). A role for LAMC3 in extracellular matrix organization of the soma-todendritic compartment was further supported by an analysis of the Human Brain Transcriptome database, showing that the developmental expression pattern of LAMC3 parallels that of other molecules important for dendritogenesis (Fig. 4e) and synapse formation (Supplementary Note, supplementary Fig. 8 and Supplementary Table 7).","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21572413","rdfs:label":"Barak 2011 human expression","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/90b593ee-f5cd-48b5-94cf-94d9f92ad556","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"consider in conjunction with Barak et al.
