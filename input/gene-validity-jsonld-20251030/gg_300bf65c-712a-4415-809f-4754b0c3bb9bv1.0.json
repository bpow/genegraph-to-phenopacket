This association was made using case-level data only). At least ​8 missense, start loss, deletion, and frameshift variants have been reported in humans. BSND​ was first associated with this disease in humans as early as 2001​ (Birkenhager et al.​). Association is seen in at least 10 probands in 4 publications (11687798, ​12574213, 23110775, 16583241). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence and experimental evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. Of note, this gene has also been implicated in nonsyndromic hearing loss. Expert review determined there was not enough convincing evidence to split out this disease. This gene-disease association is supported by functional studies that exhibit the molecular basis for disease of these variants (Birkenhager et al. 2001, Waldegger et al. 2002, Janssen et al. 2009) . A BSND mouse models have also been created that exhibit the hearing loss phenotypes seen in Bartter syndrome (Rickheit et al. 2008). In summary, BSND is definitively associated with autosomal recessive Bartter syndrome. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hearing Loss​ Working Group on 7/10/2018.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/300bf65c-712a-4415-809f-4754b0c3bb9b","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9b69acb1-93bc-4bc0-8a33-77bf64179c32","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9b69acb1-93bc-4bc0-8a33-77bf64179c32_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9b69acb1-93bc-4bc0-8a33-77bf64179c32_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2018-07-10T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9b69acb1-93bc-4bc0-8a33-77bf64179c32_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9b69acb1-93bc-4bc0-8a33-77bf64179c32_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8077eb01-cab0-4ca2-8890-d1d161c451e8","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Downgraded because it could not be used as a model for the renal phenotype","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/59e72783-d096-453b-828d-eae198e1fc73","type":"Finding","dc:description":"The KO mice exhibited a 60dB hearing loss compared to controls.
