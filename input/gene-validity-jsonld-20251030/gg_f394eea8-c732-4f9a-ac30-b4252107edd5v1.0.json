{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f394eea8-c732-4f9a-ac30-b4252107edd5v1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"The SH3PXD2B gene is located on chromosome 5 at 5q35.1 and encodes SH3 and PX domains-containing protein 2B, which is an adapter protein involved in invadopodia and podosome formation and extracellular matrix degradation. SH3PXD2B was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Frank-ter Haar syndrome (FTHS) in 2010 (Iqbal et al., 2010, PMID: 20137777). FTHS is a syndromic disorder characterized by brachycephaly, wide fontanels, prominent forehead, hypertelorism, prominent eyes, macrocornea with or without glaucoma, full cheeks, small chin, bowing of the long bones, and flexion deformity of the fingers. At least two nonsense, three frameshift, one missense, one exonic deletion, and one splice site variants that have been reported in seven probands in three publications (PMID: 20137777; Wilson et al., 2014, PMID: 24105366, Zrhidri et al., 2017, PMID: 28694206) and are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is reported to be loss of function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence including a mouse model, functional alteration in patient cells, and rescue in cell culture experiments (PMID: 20137777; Buschman et al., 2009, PMID: 19144821). In summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between SH3PXD2B and autosomal recessive Frank-ter Haar syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Syndromic Disorders Gene Curation Expert Panel on 02.01.2023 (SOP Version 9).
