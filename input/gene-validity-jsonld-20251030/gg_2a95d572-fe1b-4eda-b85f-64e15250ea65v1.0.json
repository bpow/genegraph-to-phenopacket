PMID: 16043162). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level and experimental data. Of note, this gene has previously been assessed for Long QT Syndrome.\n\nTwo missense variants reported in two probands affected by Brugada syndrome from one publication were included in this curation (PMID: 39895654). Family segregation evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship was not found in the literature. Additional reported individuals with *KCNH2 *variants were not considered for this curation (PMIDs: 16043162, 18692916, 38648771) because the phenotypic specificity and associated patch clamp data were insufficient to support an association with Brugada syndrome, as determined by the ClinGen Hereditary Cardiovascular Disease GCEP. \n\nBulk tissue gene expression data shows ubiquitous expression of *KCNH2* in human tissues, including the heart (PMID: 23715323, GTex dbGaP Accession phs000424.v10.p2). However, mice and cell culture rescue models for KCNH2 did not recapitulate the Brugada phenotype observed in human patients nor the gain of function disease mechanism indicative of Brugada syndrome (PMIDs: 12612061, 21536673). \n\nIn summary, the evidence supporting the relationship between *KCNH2* and autosomal dominant Brugada syndrome has been disputed and no valid evidence remains to support the claim. More evidence is needed to either support or entirely refute the role *KCNH2* plays in this disease. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hereditary Cardiovascular Disease GCEP on June 10th 2025 (SOP Version 11).\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2a95d572-fe1b-4eda-b85f-64e15250ea65","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/78a9eafc-a8d8-4091-9d1a-13a11804b496","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/78a9eafc-a8d8-4091-9d1a-13a11804b496_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10104","date":"2025-06-10T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/78a9eafc-a8d8-4091-9d1a-13a11804b496_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10104","date":"2025-08-26T14:59:20.826Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"There is weak case-level evidence with poor phenotype specificity in reported probands to support the KCNH2-Brugada syndrome relationship.
