The NDUFS2 gene encodes the NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) core subunit S2. Defects of this protein lead to complex I deficiency.\n\nThe NDUFS2 gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Leigh syndrome spectrum in 2001 (PMID: 11220739). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included 6 variants in 5 cases from 3 publications (PMIDs: 11220739, 20819849, 22036843). Of note, the c.875T>C (p.Met292Thr) variant is speculated to be a hypomorphic allele (found in 2 homozygotes in gnomAD at the time of this gene review). No segregation data were available. Loss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease association is also supported by known protein interactions, expression, functional alterations in patient cells, and model organisms (PMIDs: 27509854, 25613900, 14749350, 29526616, 31297047). \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support this gene-disease relationship, including that more than three years have elapsed from the first proposal of the association. This classification was approved by the NICHD U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on November 23, 2020 (SOP Version 7).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b29c415e-f26a-45f8-a491-d057e3f94727","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6df726c1-2897-46f8-aed1-f9939b9acf0c","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6df726c1-2897-46f8-aed1-f9939b9acf0c_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2021-04-09T14:31:44.546Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6df726c1-2897-46f8-aed1-f9939b9acf0c_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2021-04-09T14:31:52.931Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6df726c1-2897-46f8-aed1-f9939b9acf0c_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/efc9cff3-c360-411a-b6b4-1bbb1c9945b8_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Functional analysis: Ngu et al. 2013 used fibroblasts from this patient (Patient 5 in text), show reduced levels of complex 1 (Fig 3) compared to controls, indicative of an assembly defect.","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b2383213-f4c4-4679-960b-5722d47851ac","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11220739","rdfs:label":"Family C- C2","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":10,"detectionMethod":"Candidate gene sequencing","firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"Recurrent vomiting, failure to thrive, nystagmus, and generalized hypotonia with mild cognitive impairment but marked motor delay were present. \nLactic acid was elevated in blood (5.0 mM), as well as in CSF (3.3 mM). \nBrain CT scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed progressive hypodensity of basal ganglia and midbrain.\nCourse deteriorated steadily necessitating mechanical ventilation.\nThe child died at 3 years.\nIsolated complex I deficiency in the second child (C2) in cultured fibroblasts as well as muscle tissue (Table 1)\nConsanguineous parents, no previous family history.
