{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/69a9a75c-68ef-4eb7-979e-137b80fda51ev1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"Although *de novo* single gene deletions and protein truncating variants in *RFX3* had been reported in individuals with developmental delay, intellectual disability (ID), and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) as early as 2011 (PMIDs: 21792059, 27525107, 31981491), the first report focusing on variants in *RFX3* in relation to autosomal dominant complex neurodevelopmental disorder was published in 2021 (Harris et al., PMID: 33658631). *RFX3* encodes a member of the regulatory factor X (RFX) family of genes that act as master regulators of central nervous system development and ciliogenesis. \n\nEight unique variants (2 nonsense, 3 frameshift, 1 canonical splice site, 1 multi-exon deletion, and 1 full gene deletion) reported in 8 probands in 4 publications (PMIDs: 25844147, 27525107, 31981491, 33658631) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. Most reported variants are *de novo*, although one family was reported in which an affected parent transmitted a frameshift variant to three affected children (PMID: 33658631); there are also reports of inherited deletions (PMID: 21792059) and protein truncating variants (PMIDs: 25961944, 35982159) in individuals with ASD or ID. The mechanism of disease is suggested to be haploinsufficiency (PMID: 33658631). Three patients with missense or inframe indel variants have also been reported (PMID: 33658631), but were not scored in this curation due to lack of convincing functional data and unclear disease mechanism. *RFX3* is highly constrained for both missense (Z = 3.17, gnomAD v4.0.0) and loss-of-function variants (pLI = 1).\n\nThere are a limited number of probands with detailed phenotypic features reported. Of those cases, affected individuals present with motor and speech delays, ID, ASD, and behavioral abnormalities; other variable features include attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, dysmorphic features, hypotonia, micro/macrocephaly, seizures, and sleep abnormalities (PMIDs: 25844147, 33658631). \n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by variants in other RFX genes (*RFX7* and *RFX4*) reported in individuals with global developmental delay, ID and ASD (PMID: 33658631). \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *RFX3* and autosomal dominant complex neurodevelopmental disorder. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel on April 3, 2024 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/69a9a75c-68ef-4eb7-979e-137b80fda51e","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/645576b3-2538-445d-a39e-d52c198db9f5","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/645576b3-2538-445d-a39e-d52c198db9f5_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2024-04-03T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/645576b3-2538-445d-a39e-d52c198db9f5_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2024-06-04T16:40:58.910Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/645576b3-2538-445d-a39e-d52c198db9f5_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b884977d-291a-43ae-a4b9-ce0d67fb30cb","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b884977d-291a-43ae-a4b9-ce0d67fb30cb_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31981491","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a9ecf138-42a0-4d93-9a4c-5e3c7519c44e","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001282116.2(RFX3):c.1139G>A
