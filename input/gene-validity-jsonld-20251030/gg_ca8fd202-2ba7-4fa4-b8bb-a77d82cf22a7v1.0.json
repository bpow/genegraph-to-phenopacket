Patients with 1 allele inactivated in either *HBA1* or *HBA2* are unaffected carriers. Patients with 2 dysfunctional alleles between *HBA1* and *HBA2* have alpha-thalassemia trait with mild hypochromic microcytosis, usually with no significant clinical effect to the patient. Individuals with 3 alleles deleted or inactivated have Hemoglobin H (HbH) disease, which is characterized by more severe microcytosis, splenomegaly, and anemia. Loss of function of 4 alleles causes Hb Bart's disease, which leads to fatal hydrops fetalis (PMID: 29032940). \n\nDue to ClinGen’s framework in evaluating monogenic causes of disease, this curation focuses solely on association between *HBA1* variants and alpha-thalassemia under the disease entity, *HBA1*-related alpha-thalassemia spectrum (MONDO:0100561). The split curation for the association of *HBA2*-related alpha-thalassemia spectrum (MONDO:0100562) has been curated separately. \n\nPer criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found differences in molecular mechanisms, inheritance pattern, and phenotypic variability in alpha-thalassemia spectrum and other disease entities associated with the alpha globin genes. Therefore, the following disease entities have been split into multiple disease entities: unstable hemoglobin disease, hemoglobin M disease, familial erythrocytosis 7. \n\nWilson et al. reported the first variant specifically in *HBA1* in 1977 (PMID: 909779). 6 variants (1 nonsense, 2 missense, 2 intronic, and 1 in-frame duplication of 6 amino acids) that have been reported in 7 probands in 5 publications (PMIDs:9657838, 25976776, 24111644, 32751969, 7803274) are included in this curation. The HB Groene Hart variant was recurrent in the literature, and was scored in 4 probands across 2 publications in this curation. In 3 probands, the variant was observed in the homozygous state (PMID: 24111644) while it was observed in compound heterozygosity with the c.70G>T (p.Glu24Ter) variant in 1 proband (PMID:32751969). A monomer shift assay including Hb Groene Hart with regularly-contacting proteins revealed impaired interaction with alpha hemoglobin stabilizing protein in addition to impaired interaction with β globin protein (PMID:19349619). More evidence is available in the literature demonstrating well-known deletional variants encompassing part or all of *HBA1* such as the alpha 3.7, 4.2, and 5.2 Kb deletions (PMID:6255436). Only probands demonstrating non-deletional *HBA1* variants have been scored. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be LOF.\n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by expression studies, protein interactions, biochemical evidence, and animal models. GTEx analysis of expression in normal human tissues revealed high expression specifically in whole blood, which is consistent with the hypothesized role of *HBA1* in hemoglobin (PMID:23715323). HBA1 protein interacts with the beta hemoglobin chain encoded by the HBB gene (PMID: 6644819), which can harbor variants associated with the closely related condition beta-thalassemia. Altering heme pocket residues on *HBA1* results in decreased affinity for NO, CO2, and O2, which is consistent with the hypothesized role of *HBA1* in binding and transporting oxygen (PMID:10390349). Radiation induced mutations in mice Hba1 resulted in phenotypes also seen in humans (hypochromic microcytic anemia, decreased MCV, erythrocytosis, reticulocytosis). The mouse model was downscored due to the inability of mice to demonstrate the digenic inheritance pattern seen in humans (PMID:879556).\n\nIn summary, *HBA1* is definitively associated with autosomal recessive *HBA1*-related alpha-thalassemia. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen General Gene Curation Expert Panel on the meeting date 2/27/24 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ca8fd202-2ba7-4fa4-b8bb-a77d82cf22a7","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2f1f710c-a6b7-4a19-838c-30fc51a2c564","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2f1f710c-a6b7-4a19-838c-30fc51a2c564_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10026","date":"2025-05-01T14:31:27.445Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2f1f710c-a6b7-4a19-838c-30fc51a2c564_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10026","date":"2024-09-27T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2f1f710c-a6b7-4a19-838c-30fc51a2c564_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2af8d746-f6ee-4d9d-9f9b-3b07d3c3a848_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2a88f8b6-a9ac-44f4-b50d-12e153cab259","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2a88f8b6-a9ac-44f4-b50d-12e153cab259_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19657838","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/191c724a-7bf0-48c6-b9f8-f3b796cf1e1c","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000558.5(HBA1):c.-9G>C","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA7770220"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:AlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":0.1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/565890e8-83bb-4670-b621-c96fbf682575","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/565890e8-83bb-4670-b621-c96fbf682575_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19657838","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5d4aa3dc-c1a6-4938-881d-ef33111f3121","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000558.5(HBA1):c.95+4A>G","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA2580583020"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:AlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":0.1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2af8d746-f6ee-4d9d-9f9b-3b07d3c3a848","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19657838","rdfs:label":"Hadavi_2009_case","allele":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5d4aa3dc-c1a6-4938-881d-ef33111f3121"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/191c724a-7bf0-48c6-b9f8-f3b796cf1e1c"}],"detectionMethod":"GAP PCR, reverse hybridization and sequencing","firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypeFreeText":"Hb 9.5, MCV 68.7, MCH 15.7, MCHC 28.5, Hb A2 1.0, HB F 0.5%.
