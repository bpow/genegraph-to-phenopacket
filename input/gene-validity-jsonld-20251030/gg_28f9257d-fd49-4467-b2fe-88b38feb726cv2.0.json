PMID: 16311595). At least 93 unique variants (including many missense, nonsense, and small deletions or insertions, as well as some splicing variants) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 19 probands in 7 publications (PMIDs: 26149271, 28693988, 18164228, 16963011, 30157807, 16311595, 23580368). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence has been reached. This gene-disease relationship is supported by experimental evidence of the biochemical function, functional alteration in non-patient cells, rescue in patient cells, and a mouse model (PMIDs: 18779575, 19700356, 24889031, 16311595) . In summary, MMACHC is definitively associated with autosomal recessive inheritance of methylmalonic aciduria and homocystinuria type cblC. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/28f9257d-fd49-4467-b2fe-88b38feb726c","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6feb4bda-539f-4592-acaf-26dc186e953a","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":[{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"},{"id":"cg:sopChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6feb4bda-539f-4592-acaf-26dc186e953a_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10011","date":"2020-09-16T19:23:17.655Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6feb4bda-539f-4592-acaf-26dc186e953a_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10011","date":"2020-06-29T17:43:03.503Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6feb4bda-539f-4592-acaf-26dc186e953a_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/66bad2aa-2ecc-4fd2-850f-3f530f058b82_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The c.567dupT frameshift variant occurs in the final exon and there is no functional evidence provided for the missense variant, Gly155Arg.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/dae37cf2-b467-49fb-af63-7e202b70060e","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26149271","rdfs:label":"Proband 3","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":1,"detectionMethod":"Genomic DNA, from peripheral blood, was PCR amplified across coding exons and the flanking introns, then directly sequenced.","firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypeFreeText":"75.1 uM MMA","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0000639","obo:HP_0012120","obo:HP_0002156"],"previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"The probands were clinically and biochemically confirmed combined methylmalonic aciduria and homocystinuria.","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/66bad2aa-2ecc-4fd2-850f-3f530f058b82_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26149271","allele":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7e8e8219-e811-414e-b960-859ac6a72031","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_015506.2(MMACHC):c.567dup (p.Ile190Tyrfs)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/556708"}},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bb1c69d1-29fd-421e-b83b-2947c6643978","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NC_000001.11:g.45508829G>C","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA340133093"}}],"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"}}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/196b43ab-e14f-4eec-8bb8-b9492740e85a_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The nonsense variant, Trp203Ter, would not be predicted to undergo NMD and no functional evidence is provided for the missense variant, Arg161Gln.

This was evidenced by the increase in absorption at 473 nm (kobsd = 0.10 ± 0.004 min−1 and 0.068 ± 0.007 min−1 for methionine synthase reductase and NR1, respectively).\n\nAs reviewed in PMID: 21748409 defects in MMACHC cause elevated methylmalonic acid and homocysteine with decreased methionine production, which are the biochemical hallmarks of this disorder. The wide clinical heterogeneity of cblC disease likely depends on the nature of the different MMACHC mutations.

In cblC disorder the patients are generally unresponsive to treatment with CNCbl but are more responsive to OHCbl. These studies reveal an intrinsic difference in the ability of mutant MMACHC protein to bind CNCbl and OHCbl, indicating that this difference lies with the protein rather than in the pathways utilized for processing cobalamin. The ability of mutant MMACHC to respond to vitamin therapy depends on its ability to bind the vitamin with significant affinity, and for CNCbl, also on its ability to bind in the base-off form to facilitate reductive decyanation. The authors report that MMACHC containing the early-onset Gly147Asp mutation does not bind either vitamin form, providing a simple explanation for absence of responsiveness with either vitamin.
