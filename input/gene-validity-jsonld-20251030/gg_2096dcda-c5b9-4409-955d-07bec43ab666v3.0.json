Of note, this gene has also been implicated in multiple epiphyseal dysplasia, susceptibility to intervertebral disc disease, and non-syndromic hearing loss. These have been or will be assessed separately. At least eight unique nonsense variants have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least seven probands in five publications (PMID: 24273071, 30450842,31090205,33570243, 35241111). This gene-disease association is supported by expression studies and animal models(PMIDs: 1844825,15802199, 20686772). In summary, there is definitive evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. This gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the Hearing Loss Working group on September 18th 2019 (SOP Version 7). It was reevaluated on December 21st 2022. As a result of this reevaluation, the classification did change from moderate to definitive due and new case level evidence was reviewed and added (SOP Version 9)","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2096dcda-c5b9-4409-955d-07bec43ab666","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a436c41e-0873-4e4c-b2f2-d56f75ca737a","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":[{"id":"cg:sopChange"},{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"},{"id":"cg:newEvidence"},{"id":"cg:classificationChange"},{"id":"cg:summaryChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a436c41e-0873-4e4c-b2f2-d56f75ca737a_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2022-12-21T05:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a436c41e-0873-4e4c-b2f2-d56f75ca737a_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2024-01-24T16:48:53.903Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["RecurationTiming","RecurationNewEvidence"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a436c41e-0873-4e4c-b2f2-d56f75ca737a_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a436c41e-0873-4e4c-b2f2-d56f75ca737a_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1cdc1cb3-b460-4b34-94d8-2b4c031038f8","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/62d2df27-9077-4ca6-b8ed-d7f82f1616a0","type":"Finding","dc:description":"COL9A3 RNA was detected in dog retina.
