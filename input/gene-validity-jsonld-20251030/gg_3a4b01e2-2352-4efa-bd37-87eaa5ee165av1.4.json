Observed phenotypes in affected individuals include, but are not limited to, facial dysmorphism, ADHD, varying severity of intellectual disability, seizures, childhood-onset schizophrenia, and behavioral problems. UPF3B is involved, along with UPF3A and UPF2 in the exon junction complex, in mRNA nuclear export as well as mRNA surveillance (initiating nonsense-mediated decay of mRNAs with truncated ORFs). At least 10 nonsense, frameshift and missense variants have been reported in humans.  Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data.  \n   \n\nVariants in this gene have been reported in at least 10 probands in 5 publications (PMIDs: 22957832,  17704778, 22609145, 19238151, 20479756.

More case-level data is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence has been reached.\n\nThe mechanism for disease is expected to be hemizygous loss of function.  \n  \nThis gene-disease association is supported by in vitro functional assays and animal models (PMIDs 28948974, 26012578, 23821644). UPF3B-null mice show phenotype suggestive of the human phenotype, which is highly variable. Mutations in UPF3B are reported to affect neuronal development due to impaired NMD mechanism.\n  \nIn summary, UPF3B is definitively associated with X-linked Complex Neurodevelopmental Disorder.\t This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.
