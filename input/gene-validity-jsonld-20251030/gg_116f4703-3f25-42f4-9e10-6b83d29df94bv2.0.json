At least 7 unique variants (frameshift, splice site, exon deletion) have been reported in humans. This association was made using case-level data, animal models, expression studies, and protein interaction studies. Association is seen in at least 8 probands in 5 publications and 2 ClinVar SCVs (PMIDs: 12393799, 23813623, 25342930, 27911912, 32048449, SCV000575569.4, SCV000344371.3). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 16 additional family members (PMIDs: 12393799, 23813623, 32048449). The mechanism for disease is haploinsufficiency (PMID: 12393799, 23813623, 25342930). This gene-disease association is supported by a zebrafish transposon-mediated gene trap model and mRNA rescue, expression studies in the inner ear of mice, and protein interaction studies showing GRHL2's interaction with claudins. In summary, GRHL2 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant non-syndromic hearing loss.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/116f4703-3f25-42f4-9e10-6b83d29df94b","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a2ca9952-b611-4e6f-bbf8-aa5175248d01","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":[{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"},{"id":"cg:sopChange"},{"id":"cg:classificationChange"},{"id":"cg:newEvidence"},{"id":"cg:summaryChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a2ca9952-b611-4e6f-bbf8-aa5175248d01_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2020-05-01T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a2ca9952-b611-4e6f-bbf8-aa5175248d01_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"Ji et al. 2014 (25342930) proband 3 had an exon 5 deletion that was not able to be added to the curation but was scored as 1 point.\n\nClinvar submission from Tuebingen https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/425447/: proband with dominant family history of HL, via personal communication  NM_024915.3(GRHL2):c.801delG (p.Met267Ilefs) variant is scored as 1 point.\n\nClinvar submission from Emory https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/289923/: personal communication; variant found in mother and 5 mo. child with HL NM_024915.3(GRHL2):c.1098+1G>A is scored as 1 point.\n\nThese probands bring the total score to 14.5 points.","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a2ca9952-b611-4e6f-bbf8-aa5175248d01_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a2ca9952-b611-4e6f-bbf8-aa5175248d01_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/dc74c924-d23c-40e9-9205-a29289f72ba8","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/62e5f274-d31a-48d1-b46f-db63b3ec007d","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Expression pattern in marmoset cochlea of GRHL2 examined by immunofluorescent staining.
