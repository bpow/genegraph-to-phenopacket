FAR1 encodes a peroxisomal membrane protein that is required for the reduction of fatty acids to fatty alcohols. The disorder is characterized by spastic paraparesis and bilateral congenital/juvenile cataracts, in most combined with speech and gross motor developmental delay and truncal hypotonia (PMID: 33239752). The clinical phenotypes seen in affected individuals overlap with those of the autosomal recessive condition, FAR1 deficiency, caused by biallelic variants in FAR1. However, the biochemical phenotypes are in contrast - while FAR1 deficiency is associated with plasmalogen deficiency, FAR1 upregulation is characterized by elevated plasmalogen levels. FAR1 protein levels are subject to plasmalogen-dependent feedback regulation (PMID: 33239752). FAR1 was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant FAR1 Upregulation in 2020 (Ferdinandusseet al, 2020; PMID: 33239752), and so far this is the only report. Variants in this gene that cause FAR1 upregulation (n = 3) all affect the same residue (Arg480) and arise de novo. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. \n   \nSummary of Case Level Data (9.2 points):\nEighteen unrelated patients from around the world  in 1 publication (PMID: 33239752, 37335441, 39074165, 36781603) have been reported with de novo heterozygous variants in FAR1. Of note, all variants reported involve the same codon - Arg480.\n\nThe mechanism is reported to be gain of function (PMID: 33239752). \n  \nSummary of experimental data (1 point):\nFAR1 has a functional role in plasmalogen synthesis as outlined in PMIDs: 15220348 and 24108123.  \n  \nIn summary, the evidence to support the gene-disease relationship of FAR1 and FAR1 upregulation is moderate. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged. This gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the Peroxisomal GCEP on January 12, 2023. It was reevaluated on June 6, 2025 (SOP v 10). Although additional cases were published (PMIDs: 37335441, 39074165, 36781603), the classification did not change. \n\nLumping and Splitting Considerations: \nOMIM entities: Cataracts, spastic paraparesis, and speech delay\t(MIM# 619338), Peroxisomal fatty acyl-CoA reductase 1 disorder\t(MIM# 616154). Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found differences in the molecular mechanisms, inheritance patterns AND phenotypic presentation. Therefore, we have split curations for the disease entities, FAR1 deficiency and FAR1 upregulation (terms introduced by the peroxisomal GCEP).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e2267ada-584b-4368-a73a-90174d74f1d3","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1068b8e8-36a1-4110-9ab4-45f9d4ece894","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","changes":[{"id":"cg:newEvidence"},{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},{"id":"cg:sopChange"},{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1068b8e8-36a1-4110-9ab4-45f9d4ece894_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10049","date":"2025-07-08T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1068b8e8-36a1-4110-9ab4-45f9d4ece894_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10049","date":"2025-07-25T04:19:11.960Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["RecurationTiming"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1068b8e8-36a1-4110-9ab4-45f9d4ece894_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0b257c3c-f710-4e09-aad2-24653c9a916d","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The proband was heterozygous for the Arg480Cys missense variant.

Plasmalogen synthesis was significantly higher in cells expressing Far1 (Figure 6). The authors also found that the stability of Far1 is regulated in response to the level of plasmalogens in the CHO-K1 cells; Degradation of Far1 is inhibited in plasmalogen‐deficient cells, whereas elevation of cellular PlsEtn enhances the degradation of Far1, thereby reducing the synthesis of PlsEtn. Far1 is a rate-limiting enzyme for plasmalogen synthesis. FAR1 deficiency is characterized by low levels of plasmalogens while FAR1 dysregulation is associated with elevated levels of plasmalogens.
