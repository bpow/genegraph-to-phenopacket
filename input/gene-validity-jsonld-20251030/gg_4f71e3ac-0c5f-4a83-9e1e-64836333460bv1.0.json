We have curated the inheritance pattern for *CAV1*-related congenital generalized lipodystrophy as autosomal recessive, because a recessive mode of inheritance has been reported since (Kim et al., PMIDs: 18541701; Karhan et al., PMID: 34643546).\n\nHomozygous variants, including nonsense and frameshift mutations have been reported. Typical autosomal recessive cases due to homozygous *CAV1* variants present with a near-total absence of both subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue, severe insulin resistance, hypertriglyceridemia, hepatomegaly, hyperinsulinemia, muscular hypertrophy, and diabetes mellitus, even in early infancy (Kim et al., PMIDs: 18541701; Karhan et al., PMID: 34643546).\n\nTo date, only two homozygous *CAV1* variants (one nonsense and one frameshift) have been reported to cause congenital generalized lipodystrophy type 3 in humans. Evidence supporting the association of *CAV1* with CGL3 includes case-level data and experimental data. The aggregated score for case-level data is  7 points. Variants in this gene were curated for this summary in 5 patients in 2 families in 2 publications (PMIDs: 18541701, 34643546) presenting as congenital, generalized lipodystrophy type 3. The calculated LOD score was 2.81.  The  total score for genetic evidence was  7 points. This gene-disease relationship is supported by functional assays and knockout mouse models (PMIDs: 18541701, 34643546,11739396,12660144). Total points for the experimental evidence are 6. Total points for genetic and experimental evidence together are 13.\n\nPer criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found differences in inheritance pattern, mutational mechanism and phenotypic variability for variants causing CAV1 related lipodystrophy (CGL3 vs familial partial and/or progeroid lipodystrophy) and pulmonary arterial hypertension. \n\nTherefore, we curated *CAV1* as a split curation for autosomal recessive congenital, generalized lipodystrophy (OMIM:612526). Autosomal dominant familial partial and/or progeriod lipodystrophy(OMIM:606721) and autosomal dominant pulmonary arterial hypertension (OMIM:615343) have or will be curated separately in split curations.\n\nIn summary, *CAV1* is definitively associated with autosomal recessive, congenital generalized lipodystrophy type 3 from birth or early infancy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time.\n\nApproved by the Monogenic Diabetes GCEP May 14, 2025 (SOP v11).\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4f71e3ac-0c5f-4a83-9e1e-64836333460b","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8c3e1365-0b20-43c6-87a5-3c15951a2acf","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8c3e1365-0b20-43c6-87a5-3c15951a2acf_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10016","date":"2025-06-11T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8c3e1365-0b20-43c6-87a5-3c15951a2acf_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10016","date":"2025-06-11T12:56:35.841Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8c3e1365-0b20-43c6-87a5-3c15951a2acf_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/22c7c00d-b95d-4d20-a841-8103b941e8f6_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/31c34714-5623-473a-8ed3-ea427949bf41","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":4,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/31c34714-5623-473a-8ed3-ea427949bf41_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"The biallelic p.His79Glnfs*3 loss-of-function mutation in CAV1 leads to congenital generalized lipodystrophy (CGL) with achalasia, driven by Caveolin-1 loss, disrupted caveolae, defective lipid metabolism, and impaired insulin signaling.

Insulin tolerance tests (ITT) show that young Cav-1 null mice on a normal chow diet exhibit significant insulin resistance compared to wild-type controls. This resistance primarily results from a defect in adipose tissue, evidenced by a >90% reduction in insulin receptor protein levels, despite unchanged insulin receptor mRNA levels. These findings suggest that Caveolin-1 functions as a molecular chaperone essential for stabilizing the insulin receptor in adipocytes in vivo. Supporting this, recombinant expression of Caveolin-1 in Cav-1 null mouse embryonic fibroblasts restores insulin receptor protein levels. These results provide evidence that the lean body phenotype observed in Cav-1 knockout mice is due, at least in part, to a defect in insulin-regulated lipogenesis.
