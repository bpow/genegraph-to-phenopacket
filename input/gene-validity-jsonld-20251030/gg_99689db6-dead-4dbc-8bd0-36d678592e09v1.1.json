This is the only disorder known to be associated with *PDE6G* at the current time. The disease entity has been renamed as PDE6-related retinopathy.\n\nA canonical splice site variant shown by RT-PCR analysis to result in a frameshift has been reported in 6 homozygous affected individuals in an extended Israeli family of Muslim Arab origin (Dvir et al, 2010 PMID: 20655036). Affected individuals presented with early onset, severe disease. Two other apparently unrelated individuals have been reported (Van Schil et al, 2018, PMID: 28749477) with inherited retinal disease and homozygosity for the same copy number variant (GRCh37 chr17: g.79612525_79619171del, also denoted as NM_001290212.1(TSPAN10): c.658_NM_002602.3 (PDE6G):c.147-456del, which includes loss of coding exons 3 and 4 of *PDE6G*, and part of *TSPAN10*). Three unpublished probands and one affected sibling have been reported with retinopathy and homozygosity for the same frameshift variant, NM_002602.4:c.69dup, p.(Arg24GlnfsTer6) (Invitae, personal communication). Additional unpublished cases with homozygosity for loss of function variants are known to members of the ClinGen Retina GCEP. The cases reported in PMID: 28749477 and the unpublished cases could not be entered and scored in the GCI due to technical limitations. The disease mechanism appears to be loss of function.\n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence. A detailed review outlines extensive evidence supporting the function of PDE6G, a function that is consistent with the disease entity (Cote et al, 2022, PMID: 34170501). In brief, PDE6G encodes the gamma (inhibitory) subunit of rod-specific phosphodiesterase 6 (PDE6). PDE6 is a multi-subunit enzyme composed of alpha and beta catalytic subunits (PDE-alpha and PDE-beta, encoded by *PDE6A* and *PDE6B* respectively), and two inhibitory gamma subunits (PDE-gamma, encoded by *PDE6G*). PDE6 is an essential component of the visual transduction cascade. In response to light activation, PDE6 regulates intracellular cyclic guanosine monophosphate levels by hydrolysis of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). The PDE-gamma subunit is a multi-functional regulator of PDE6 activity, and thus plays a critical role in vision (Power et al, 2019, PMID: 31374251). PDE-gamma interacts with the products of other genes which have been implicated in retinal dystrophy, including *PDE6A*, *PDE6B*, and *GNAT1* (Irwin et al, 2019, PMID: 31690623). The gene is most highly expressed in retina and retinal pigment epithelium with much lower expression in other tissues (Bryan et al, 2018, PMID: 30239781). In addition, two knock-out mouse models recapitulate the early onset, severe features of retinopathy observed in patients (Tsang et al, 1996, PMID: 8638127; Jentzsch et al, 2023, PMID: 37363133). The retinal degeneration phenotype in *Pde6g* knockout mice is rescued by expression of a wild type *Pde6g* transgene (Tsang et al, 1998, PMID: 9756475). Finally, functional alteration studies, in which different mutant *Pde6g* cDNAs were expressed in knockout mice, have helped to elucidate the functional domains of Pde6g and *in vivo* impact of different variants (Farber and Tsang, 2003, PMID: 12700134).\n\nAs noted, due to technical limitations, some cases could not be scored in the GCI. However, even if these cases were scored conservatively, the total score would exceed 12 points. Therefore, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *PDE6G* and PDE6G-related retinopathy (also known as retinitis pigmentosa 57). This classification was approved by the ClinGen Retina Gene Curation Expert panel on June 6th, 2024 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/99689db6-dead-4dbc-8bd0-36d678592e09","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b5b69965-33e0-4a8c-b5dd-faede6c39912","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b5b69965-33e0-4a8c-b5dd-faede6c39912_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10072","date":"2025-01-04T04:25:39.829Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b5b69965-33e0-4a8c-b5dd-faede6c39912_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10072","date":"2024-06-06T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"Due to technical limitations, published cases with a CNV and unpublished cases could not be scored in the GCI.

The authors made various mutant and wild-type (control) Pde6g cDNAs under the control of the opsin promoter, used them to produce transgenic mice, and then back-crossed to Pde6g knockout mice (Tsang et al, 1996, PMID: 8638127) to generate a knockout mouse expressing the transgene. Because the results of these experiments illustrate the impact of different amino acid changes on the function of PDE6G, they are included here, under “functional alteration”, rather than in the “non-human animal models” section. Results are summarized below:\nDel7C - Deletion of the last seven amino acids of PDE gamma had previously been shown in in vitro experiments to decrease the inhibitory potential of the subunit (Lipkin et al, 1990, PMID: 1966521), but not to affect binding of PDE gamma to PDE alpha-beta (Lipkin et al, 1988, PMID: 2455657). Expression of Del7C in the Pde6g knockout mice resulted in photoreceptor degeneration and abnormal ERG, but more slowly than in the knockout mouse. Surprisingly, PDE activity was reduced (by 90%) which was shown to be due to a reduction in PDE-alpha and PDE-beta protein, indicating the the C-terminus of PDE-gamma is important for stabilizing the catalytic core of PDE6.\nTyr84 of PDE6G had previously been shown to decrease the inhibitory potential of PDE-gamma ((Lipkin et al, 1988, PMID: 2455657). Although this variant was expected to result in a constitutively active PDE, and thus produce low levels of cGMP, Pde6g mice expressing p.Tyr84Gly mice showed normal inhibition of rod-specific PDE and cGMP levels similar to those of control retinas, and the retinal degeneration noted in the Pde6g parental mice was rescued. Further work showed that it was more difficult for T-alpha to remove the mutant Y84G PDE gamma than the wild-type PDE gamma from the PDE alpha-beta core. There was a 10-fold decrease in the amplitude of the a-wave and a 1.5-fold reduction in the b-wave, indicating that p.Y84G mutation produced a much milder phenotype in vivo than that predicted from previous in vitro assays (Lipkin et al, 1988, PMID: 2455657).\npTrp70Ala reduced the affinity of PDE-gamma for transducin and abolished effector-mediated acceleration of T alphaGTPase (Otto-Bruc, 1993, PMID: 8395212). Introduction of a p.Trp70Ala transgene into Pde6g mice resulted in major changes in the ERG, showing desensitizing of the photoreceptors, but prevented retinal degeneration. The authors state that this impact is similar to Congenital Stationary Night Blindness.\n","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12700134","rdfs:label":"Impact of different amino acid changes on Pde6g function"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b5b69965-33e0-4a8c-b5dd-faede6c39912_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f610a5a2-31c9-445c-9333-aa1ff0c497b6","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ce24d123-4723-42fe-ae38-d13018eeb523","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Pde6g knockout mice exhibit rapid and severe retinal degeneration, with progressive loss of rod photoreceptor cells, and abnormal ERGs.
