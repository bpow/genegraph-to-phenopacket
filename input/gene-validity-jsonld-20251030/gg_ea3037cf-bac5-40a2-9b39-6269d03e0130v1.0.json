{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ea3037cf-bac5-40a2-9b39-6269d03e0130v1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"The SIX5 gene has been associated with autosomal dominant branchio-oto-renal syndrome using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of 4/20/2017. This association was made using case-level data only. At least 5 missense variants have been reported in humans. SIX5 was first associated with this disease in humans as early as 2007 (Hoskins et al.). Association has been reported in at least 6 probands in 2 publications (17357085, 24429398), however the reported variants are high in frequency in population databases, have no evidence of pathogenicity, and/or an alternate cause of disease has later been reported (21280147). This gene-disease association is supported by protein interaction and biochemical function studies (14704431, 17357085, 11950062). While EYA1 and SIX1 gene inactivation in mice leads to ear and kidney abnormalities, two independent SIX5 mouse models have cataracts and no ear or kidney abnormalities (10802667, 10802668). In summary, there is convincing evidence disputing the association between SIX5 and autosomal dominant branchio-oto-renal syndrome. More evidence is needed to either support or refute the role SIX5 plays in this disease. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hearing Loss Working Group on 1/16/2018.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ea3037cf-bac5-40a2-9b39-6269d03e0130","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0667561f-aa48-4ad5-b4ff-45aac933b255","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0667561f-aa48-4ad5-b4ff-45aac933b255_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2018-01-16T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0667561f-aa48-4ad5-b4ff-45aac933b255_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"Reported variants are not scorable for the following reasons: higher frequency in gnomAD than the disease prevalence, no evidence of pathogenicity, alternate cause of disease later discovered.
