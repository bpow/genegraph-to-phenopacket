Molybdenum cofactor deficiency type C (MOCODC) is characterized by refractory neonatal seizures, dysmorphic features, ocular lens dislocation, and a characteristic urinary profile indicative of an underlying biochemical dysfunction (PMID: 33017596). The underlying mechanism is a failure to synthesize molybdenum cofactor, leading to loss of function of the enzymes sulfite oxidase, xanthine oxidase, and aldehyde oxidase (PMID: 33017596).\n\nLumping and Splitting: \n\n*GPHN* encodes the gephyrin protein, which has two catalytically active domains that both participate in molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis. This protein also forms oligomeric clusters that act as scaffolds to promote the clustering of glycine and GABA type A receptors at the postsynaptic membrane of inhibitory neurons, a process that occurs independent of enzymatic activity. Heterozygous *GPHN* variants have been reported in individuals with complex neurodevelopmental disorders, but it is unclear at this time whether these variants are truly causative. Conversely, MOCODC is an autosomal recessive disease driven by loss of gephyrin enzyme activity. Therefore, this split curation only includes cases of confirmed molybdenum cofactor deficiency type C.\n\nVariants in this gene have been reported in two probands in two publications (PMID: 11095995, 22040219). Co-segregation with disease has not been observed in the literature. The mechanism of disease is biallelic loss of function.\n\nThis gene-disease association is also supported by in vitro functional assays and an animal model (PMID: 9812897, 11095995, 33017596). Molybdenum cofactor synthesis was completely absent in fibroblasts from a MOCODC patient homozygous for a predicted null *GPHN* allele. Homozygous knock-out of the homologous gene in mice leads to the combined loss of sulfite oxidase and xanthine reductase. Further, these mice fail to thrive, have a significantly reduced lifespan, and exhibit spasticity reminiscent of the seizures observed in MOCODC patients.\n\nIn summary, there is moderate evidence to support the gene-disease relationship between *GPHN* and autosomal recessive molybdenum cofactor deficiency type C. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has yet emerged. This classification was approved by the ClinGen General Inborn Errors of Metabolism GCEP on 5/12/2023 (SOP Version 9).\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bde8ed49-fbb4-49de-8dfb-523c0a7f7f59","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/29f6ebf3-c4c5-4770-b7d1-50816b9f9d74","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","changes":[{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},{"id":"cg:sopChange"}],"contributions":[{"agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","role":"SecondaryContributor"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/29f6ebf3-c4c5-4770-b7d1-50816b9f9d74_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10097","date":"2024-11-27T00:01:02.632Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/29f6ebf3-c4c5-4770-b7d1-50816b9f9d74_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10097","date":"2023-05-12T18:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["ErrorClarification"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/29f6ebf3-c4c5-4770-b7d1-50816b9f9d74_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/29f6ebf3-c4c5-4770-b7d1-50816b9f9d74_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/08abc20b-beec-4c7a-b6bb-7477941f25d0","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Given the existing body of work, the thoroughness of the review, and the fact that the authors directly address the mechanism of disease due to loss of gene function, this score has been upgraded.","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b9cc608f-9906-4614-9737-c077eba415ff","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Mo-cofactor (MoCo) is necessary for the function of four enzymes: sulfite oxidase, xanthine oxidase, aldehyde oxidase, and mitochondrial amidoxime-reducing component.
