Absence of laterality defects is observed in all patients reported which coincides with a defect in the radial spokes linking each peripheral microtubule doublet to the two central microtubules in 9+2 cilia (PMID: 23993197). Infertility or subfertility is also reported in male and female patients (PMIDs: 24568568 and 23993197).\n \n6 (nonsense, splice site, and missense) variants that have been reported in 6 probands in 3 publications (PMIDs: 23993197, 24518672, and 24568568) are included in the curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be biallelic loss of function.\n \nExperimental evidence supporting this gene-disease association includes expression, structural and functional alteration in patient cells, and non-human model organism evidence. Biased RSPH1 expression in PCD relevant tissues (testis, lung, and fallopian tube) has been detected (PMID: 24309898). Cryo-electron tomography revealed a variety of CPC abnormalities in *RSPH1*-mutant cilia (apparently normal 9+2 microtubule arrangement, with one of the CPC microtubules missing (9+1), with the entire CPC missing (9+0), with the CPC replaced by one DMT ((8+1) +0), or with a doubled CPC with 4 singlet microtubules (9+4) (PMID: 25473808). Cilia from *RSPH1*-mutant individuals showed rotational movement, similar to that of nodal (9 + 0) cilia, compared to a mostly planar (back and forth) motion in healthy cilia (PMID: 24568568). In Chlamydomonas, Yang et al., 2006 (PMID: 16507594) identified RSP1(the ortholog of RSPH1) from isolated radial spokes by using mass spectrometric methods. Rsph1-/- mice showed various ciliary abnormalities with significantly reduced CBF.  The mutant animals also developed various degrees of hydrocephalus, similar to other mouse models of PCD (PMID: 30896965). \n  \nIn summary, *RSPH1* is definitively associated with autosomal recessive Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia 24. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time.This classification was approved by the ClinGen Motile Ciliopathy GCEP on June 7th, 2022 (SOP Version 8).\n \n \n \n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0af67b4b-3a62-4c48-9fae-1a63634fbec1","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f2bdb2e5-9659-46af-b306-e01207f31174","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f2bdb2e5-9659-46af-b306-e01207f31174_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10102","date":"2022-06-07T11:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f2bdb2e5-9659-46af-b306-e01207f31174_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10102","date":"2022-06-08T09:43:32.926Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f2bdb2e5-9659-46af-b306-e01207f31174_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1d1434e9-d15f-4934-b92d-2afe350a8ec6_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f1988d7e-c26d-4388-aa65-3f52abdebb88","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"the c.275-2A>C mutation, located upstream of the fourth exon, leads to the skipping of exons 4 and 5 and to a premature stop codon (p.Gly92Alafs*10).
