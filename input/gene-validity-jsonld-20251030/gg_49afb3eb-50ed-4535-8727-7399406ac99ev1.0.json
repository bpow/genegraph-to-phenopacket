This association was made using case-level and experimental data. More than a 30 pathogenic variants in this gene are reported in humans, ranging from partial deletions and duplications, nonsense, frameshift, missense and splicing variants. Congenital fibrinogen deficiency is characterized by quantitative and qualitative defects in fibrinogen. It may manifest as afibrinogenemia, dysfibrinogenemia and hypodysfibrinogenemia. Clinical symptoms include a bleeding diathesis and/or a thrombotic phenotype. \n\nSummary of Case Level Data (12 points): The association is seen in at least 11 probands in 6 publications (PMID:11460510, 11739173, 11354637, 10602365, 11159525, 14615374). More case-level evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts) has been reached.\n\nThe mechanism for disease have been reported to be heterozygous as well as biallelic loss of function. (PMID: 10602365, 11460510). \n\nSummary of Experimental Data (6 points): FGA encodes the α subunit of the coagulation factor, fibrinogen, which is a hexamer of three subunit chains (PMID: 22836683). The Aα fibrinopeptide interacts with thrombin, which catalyzes the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin (PMID: 15572239). It is synthesized in the liver and secreted into the plasma (PMID: 20921339). Mouse and zebrafish models are reported that recapitulate fibrinogen deficiency (PMID: 7649481, 24553182).   \n\nIn summary, the FGA-Congenital fibrinogen deficiency gene-disease relationship is definitive. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hemostasis/Thrombosis GCEP on January 22, 2020 (SOP Version 7).\n\nLumping & Splitting information: OMIM assertions - (1) Congenital Afibrinogenemia (MIM: 202400); (2) Congenital Dysfibrinogenemia (MIM: 616004); (3) Congenital Hypodysfibrinogenemia (MIM: 616004); (4) Familial Visceral Amyloidosis (MIM: 105200). Orphanet assertions - (1)  Familial afibrinogenemia; (2)  Familial dysfibrinogenemia; (3) Familial hypodysfibrinogenemia; (4)  Familial hypofibrinogenemia; (5) AFib amyloidosis. \nPer criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in molecular mechanism(s) underlying the disease entities: Congenital Afibrinogenemia, Congenital Dysfibrinogenemia, Congenital Hypodysfibrinogenemia and Familial hypofibrinogenemia. These entities have been lumped together under Congenital Fibrinogen Deficiency. Familial Visceral Amyloidosis is split out from this larger entity. It does not fall under the purview of the Hemostasis/Thrombosis GCEP, and this entity will be curated separately in the future.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/49afb3eb-50ed-4535-8727-7399406ac99e","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d34ded98-dbf7-4dc7-bea4-803db1857bf8","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d34ded98-dbf7-4dc7-bea4-803db1857bf8_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2020-01-22T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d34ded98-dbf7-4dc7-bea4-803db1857bf8_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d34ded98-dbf7-4dc7-bea4-803db1857bf8_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d34ded98-dbf7-4dc7-bea4-803db1857bf8_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/11efbe44-9c3b-4d5f-9e49-8c292ba7c543","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bd50ea0d-69cd-45e2-8a58-197965000993","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Zebrafish homozygous for the truncated fibrinogen Aα were found to be afibrinogenemic, similar to humans with homozygous/compound heterozygous LOF variants.
