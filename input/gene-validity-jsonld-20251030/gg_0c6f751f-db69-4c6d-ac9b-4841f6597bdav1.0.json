The TIMMDC1 gene encodes translocase of inner mitochondrial membrane domain-containing protein 1, a NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) assembly factor.\n\nThe TIMMDC1 gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Leigh syndrome spectrum in 2017 (PMID: 28604674). There were other individuals in this paper reported to have Leigh syndrome spectrum, however not enough details were provided to confirm this diagnosis. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included one homozygous variant identified in one case in one publication (PMID: 28604674). No segregation data were available. Loss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease association is also supported by biochemical function, expression data, functional alteration in non-patient cells, and rescue in patient cells (PMIDs: 24344204, 25613900, 28604674). \n\nIn summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although the total score (7) falls in the moderate range, only one case with Leigh syndrome spectrum has been reported and confirmed, therefore this gene-disease association can only reach a limited classification at this time. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on June 30, 2021 (SOP Version 7).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0c6f751f-db69-4c6d-ac9b-4841f6597bda","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/83d26d62-2863-46d9-ad7d-96c086e65e8e","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/83d26d62-2863-46d9-ad7d-96c086e65e8e_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2021-06-30T22:00:13.257Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/83d26d62-2863-46d9-ad7d-96c086e65e8e_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2021-06-30T22:00:22.487Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"Only one case scored so must downgrade to limited.","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/83d26d62-2863-46d9-ad7d-96c086e65e8e_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d3b46a7e-d33e-4cde-8e97-edfd0a37a8d6_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Western blot analysis confirmed TIMMDC1-deficiency in all 3 patient cell lines (Fig. 2f, Supplementary Fig. 10).

Split read distribution indicated that both TIMMDC1-deficient patients expressed almost exclusively a TIMMDC1 isoform with a new exon in intron 5 (Fig. 3d). This new exon introduces a frameshift yielding a premature stop codon (p.Gly199_Thr200ins5*, Fig. 3e).
