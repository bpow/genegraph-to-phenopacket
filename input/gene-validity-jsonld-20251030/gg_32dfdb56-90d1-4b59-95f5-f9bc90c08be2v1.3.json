This gene-disease relationship is supported by a mouse model that showed the histology of *Tbx5* and *Osr1* transgenic mouse embryo hearts at E13.5 with missing structures of atrial septation (PMID: 26744331). In summary, the evidence supporting the relationship between *OSR1* and autosomal dominant congenital heart disease has been disputed and no valid evidence remains to support the claim. More evidence is needed to either support or entirely refute the role *OSR1* plays in this disease. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Congenital Heart Disease GCEP on the meeting date April 8th, 2024 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/32dfdb56-90d1-4b59-95f5-f9bc90c08be2","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1353bd05-2078-40c0-b339-5c786c3997b1","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"NoKnownDiseaseRelationship","changes":[{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},{"id":"cg:classificationChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1353bd05-2078-40c0-b339-5c786c3997b1_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10130","date":"2024-04-08T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1353bd05-2078-40c0-b339-5c786c3997b1_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10130","date":"2025-10-10T18:45:17.955Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"There is a lack of scorable genetic evidence at this point.
