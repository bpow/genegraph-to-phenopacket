{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ba51566b-854a-4d9a-bfc2-149bacb9ffa1v1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"The relationship between *NDUFB3* and primary mitochondrial disease was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of February 7, 2022. The *NDUFB3* gene encodes NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) subunit B3, which is essential for complex I activity and assembly. Defects of this protein lead to complex I deficiency.\n\nThe *NDUFB3* gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive mitochondrial disease in 2012 (PMID: 22277967). While various names have been given to the constellation of features seen in those with NDUFB3-related disease, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the NDUFB3 phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included two variants identified in eleven cases [10 cases had homozygous c.64T>C (p.Trp22Arg); the 11th case was compound heterozygous for c.64T>C (p.Trp22Arg) and c.208G>T (p.Gly70Ter)] in four publications (PMIDs: 22277967, 22499348, 27091925, 31000363). Features seen in these cases include intrauterine growth restriction, oligohydramnios, failure to thrive, short stature, metabolic acidosis, lactic acidosis, developmental delay, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, arrhythmia (Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome), pulmonary hypertension, liver disease, and dysmorphic features (prominent forehead, smooth philtrum, deep-set eyes, low-set ears). No segregation data were available. Loss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease association is also supported by known biochemical function, functional alteration in patient cells, functional alteration in non-patient cells, and rescue in patient cells (PMIDs: 22277967, 22499348, 27626371, 27509854).\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support this gene-disease relationship, including that more than three years have elapsed since the first proposal of the association. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on February 7, 2022 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ba51566b-854a-4d9a-bfc2-149bacb9ffa1","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5d93728e-eda7-4f4a-bd64-a1f545476ee8","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5d93728e-eda7-4f4a-bd64-a1f545476ee8_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2022-02-07T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5d93728e-eda7-4f4a-bd64-a1f545476ee8_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2022-06-01T00:04:42.694Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5d93728e-eda7-4f4a-bd64-a1f545476ee8_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5d93728e-eda7-4f4a-bd64-a1f545476ee8_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/60b63c0a-7300-473d-a814-9928f8729c13","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Significant increase of complex I activity (figure 2).\n--CI content consistently low in naïve cells, but increased significantly after expression of the corresponding wild type cDNA (figure 2A).\n--NDUFB3wt in cells of patient 50845, led to a significant increase of complex I activity (figure 2B) \n--Impaired CI assembly evidenced in Figure 4 (after the transduction of the patient cell line with the NDUFB3wt, the amounts of mitochondrial supercomplexes in patient fibroblasts increased up to 43% of the control (not detectable in patient before).
