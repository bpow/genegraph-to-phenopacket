This interaction was specific, as neither GST alone nor GST-KCNQ1 fragments from other intracellular regions without the LZ motif coprecipitated PP1, PKA, or yotiao.GST–KCNQ1-LZ did not directly bind recombinant PP1 or PKA catalytic subunits indicating that the binding of PP1 and PKA to hKCNQ1 requires yotiao.

When hKCNQ1 and yotiao were coexpressed CHO cells, PKA and PP1 were coimmunoprecipitated with hKCNQ1. Without yotiao, PKA and PP1 did not coimmunoprecipitate with hKCNQ1.

Indeed, SCD is associated with SNS stimulation in 81% of individuals with the KCNQ1-G589D mutation in whom a trigger event can be identified (13), in contrast to other K1 channel mutations in which only ;10% of SCD cases are triggered by SNS activation (4).
