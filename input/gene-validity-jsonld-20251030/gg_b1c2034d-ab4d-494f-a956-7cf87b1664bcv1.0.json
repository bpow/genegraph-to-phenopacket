(PMID: 4351905). Patients with beta thalassemia are grouped into three categories based upon clinical severity. Patients with beta thalassemia major, the most severe form, present early in life with severe anemia requiring blood transfusions and if untreated often have phenotypes such as growth retardation, hepatosplenomegaly, and jaundice. Patients with beta thalassemia intermedia can present later in life with moderate anemia, in some patients requiring blood transfusions, while thalassemia minor patients range on a spectrum from mild anemia to asymptomatic. In the dominant form of the disorder over 44 unique variants have been reported in humans (PMID:23637309), the majority being frameshift, in frame insertion or deletion, or missense, but nonsense variants have also been reported. Many of the frameshift variants are found in the final exon and lead to elongated protein products. The mechanism of autosomal dominant beta thalassemia is dominant negative and is due to variants causing unstable beta globin, which lead to the buildup of beta globin chains in addition to alpha globin chains, resulting in ineffective erythropoiesis. Additionally, unlike recessive forms of the disease, which have been selected for in areas endemic to Plasmodium falciparum malaria, autosomal dominant beta thalassemia is not thought to confer selective advantage due in part to the affected status of heterozygous individuals.\n\nEvidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data. Eleven unique variants from 11 probands in 11 publications were curated (PMIDs:15977037, 24789613, 2070092, 1971109, 11300352, 1958498, 34323379, 31084366, 16628732, 16189162, 2001456). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence has been reached. Experimentally, this gene-disease relationship is supported by the biochemical function of beta globin (PMID:8978308) and GTEx bulk tissue expression showing *HBB* is overwhelmingly expressed in the blood (PMID:23715323). In summary *HBB* is definitively associated with autosomal dominant beta thalassemia. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen General Gene Curation Expert Panel on the meeting date 3/22/2023 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b1c2034d-ab4d-494f-a956-7cf87b1664bc","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b52b6f04-67a6-4c4b-9765-2067e3b1e297","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b52b6f04-67a6-4c4b-9765-2067e3b1e297_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10026","date":"2023-03-22T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b52b6f04-67a6-4c4b-9765-2067e3b1e297_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10026","date":"2023-05-04T17:52:16.939Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b52b6f04-67a6-4c4b-9765-2067e3b1e297_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0e601fc4-4e35-4a9c-a192-47cb9c4d14d4","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Absent from gnomAD.
