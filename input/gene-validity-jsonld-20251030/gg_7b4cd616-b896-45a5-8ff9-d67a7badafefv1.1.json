Its association with LQTS is based on a study utilizing a candidate gene approach which identified a missense variant in a genotype-negative LQTS family but not in other genotype-negative LQTS patients. Because of the candidate gene approach, lack of segregation or case-control data and paucity of additional genetic and experimental data, this gene-disease association was classified as disputed.\nNote: All LQTS genes were curated by 3 separate blinded teams. The evidence and scores reached by these 3 teams was reviewed by the LQTS Clinical Domain Expert Panel.
