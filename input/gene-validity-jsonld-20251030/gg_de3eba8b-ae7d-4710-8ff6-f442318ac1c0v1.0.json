PEX3 encodes a peroxisome membrane protein involved in early peroxisome membrane biosynthesis prior to matrix protein import. Peroxisomal biogenesis disorders are caused by defects in various stages of peroxisomal protein import and/or peroxisome biogenesis, involving at least 14 PEX genes. PEX3 belongs to complementation group G and mutations in the gene result in cells devoid of peroxisomal remnants (Waterham and Ebberink 2012, PMID 22871920).\nPEX3 was FIRST reported in relation to autosomal recessive Peroxisome biogenesis disorder in 2000. (Muntau et al, PMID: 10958759; Shimozawa et al, PMID: 10942428; Ghaedi et al, PMID: 10968777). At least 8 nonsense, splice site, frameshift and missense variants have been reported in humans.  Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data.  \n   \nSummary of Case Level Data (12 points): Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 8 probands in 8 publications (PMIDs 10958759, 27557811, 28673549, 23245813, 10968777, 10942428, 20033294, 21031596). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 1 additional family member.  \n   \nThe mechanism for disease is expected to be homozygous loss of function.  \n  \nSummary of experimental data (4.5 points): This gene-disease association is supported by in vitro functional assays and animal models (PMIDs 10958759, 21826223, 12096124). \n  \nIn summary, PEX3 is definitively associated with  autosomal recessive Peroxisome biogenesis disorder. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Peroxisomal Disorders GCEP on Nov 1, 2019 (SOP Version 7).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/de3eba8b-ae7d-4710-8ff6-f442318ac1c0","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d53df483-c31a-4672-8a11-04d33d6df336","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d53df483-c31a-4672-8a11-04d33d6df336_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10049","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d53df483-c31a-4672-8a11-04d33d6df336_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10049","date":"2019-11-01T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d53df483-c31a-4672-8a11-04d33d6df336_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d53df483-c31a-4672-8a11-04d33d6df336_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/220e6fc1-c867-4144-99a5-0aff9777cc6b","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The evidence is scored reduced points as the paper does not present the supporting data.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/eafb6126-c490-4267-9880-39b634a439a8","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Homozygous flies with the partial deletion of the pex3 locus as well as compound heterozygous flies with the partial pex3 deletion and a complete deletion of the pex3 locus are reported to have died as larvae.\n\nOverexpression in S2 cells of proteins with peroxisome-targeting signals, PTS1 and PMP70-ECFP, showed co-localization in peroxisomes in the wild-type flies, while almost no positive signals (<1 in 10 cells) were observed in the pex3 homzygous mutants, indicating that pex3 is essential for peroxisome biogenesis.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21826223","rdfs:label":"Nakayama_Fly model","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d567a951-02a8-42dd-aa8c-701cdaffc151","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The evidence is scored reduced points.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b98ee901-2f94-4828-916d-f00d1e67dc8e","type":"Finding","dc:description":"The IMPC data shows high Phenodigm scores indicative of the similarity in presentation of the mouse phenotype to that seen in human disease (https://www.mousephenotype.org/data/genes/MGI:1929646#diseases).","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21677750","rdfs:label":"Skarnes_PEX3 Mouse","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/25b18b7b-c76a-4cd6-8513-256eff13eb3e","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/86acf29f-52a5-46e8-ae67-b59d9f7a4d35","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Immunoflorescent microscopy of fibroblasts from patients showed diffuse staining iwth antibodies to catalase, indicating absence of intact peroxisomes.
