{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ba5e3cea-ede2-4dab-ac67-f65dd1bfd35fv1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"*GOSR2* was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive progressive myoclonus epilepsy in 2011 (Corbett et al., PMID: 21549339). A founder variant (c.430G>T, p.Gly144Trp) has been reported in the homozygous state in at least 28 individuals with progressive myoclonus epilepsy (PMIDs: 21549339, 23449775, 24458321, 30838261, 32105965). In addition, seven other variants (splicing, nonsense, in-frame deletion, start loss, missense) have been reported in five additional probands across five publications, and are included in this curation (PMIDs: 30363482, 29855340, 33639315, 34167170, and 37895210). Most individuals reported in the literature, especially with the founder variant, have ataxia, myoclonus, seizures, scoliosis, and elevated creatine kinase. In addition to these features, some individuals who are not homozygous for the founder variant in *GOSR2* (either two non-founder variants or compound heterozygotes with a single founder variant) also present with muscular dystrophy and/or changes on muscle biopsy (PMIDs: 34167170, 29855340). There is no reported difference in disease mechanism for these cases. Because of this, and the large phenotypic overlap between these individuals and who are homozygous for the founder variant, we have lumped these cases into one curation for autosomal recessive progressive myoclonus epilepsy. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss of function (PMIDs: 21549339, 28982678). In summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between *GOSR2* and autosomal recessive progressive myoclonus epilepsy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time.\n\nThis classification was approved by the ClinGen Epilepsy Gene Curation Expert Panel on April 16, 2024 (SOP version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ba5e3cea-ede2-4dab-ac67-f65dd1bfd35f","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fbb3e3b1-2e45-416f-9449-ad36d6233e0d","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fbb3e3b1-2e45-416f-9449-ad36d6233e0d_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10005","date":"2024-06-14T17:22:05.406Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fbb3e3b1-2e45-416f-9449-ad36d6233e0d_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10005","date":"2024-04-16T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fbb3e3b1-2e45-416f-9449-ad36d6233e0d_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fbb3e3b1-2e45-416f-9449-ad36d6233e0d_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1472b3ec-c1c5-4215-83fb-83b582195653_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fd96f6f8-8a57-4144-be27-249d01065f37","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fd96f6f8-8a57-4144-be27-249d01065f37_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"The novel GOSR2 deletion shortens the distance\nbetween the layer +2 and layer +3 amino acids in the GOSR2\nSNARE domain (Fig. 1D).10 This might result in SNARE\ndomain misalignment during SNAREpin formation and, ulti\u0002mately, reduced membrane fusion.

She presented with mild gait ataxia at age 2 as well as transient episodes of motor deterioration triggered by infection and fever. Subsequently, she developed generalized action myoclonus and epilepsy at around age 14. In her twenties, she required a wheelchair to mobilize for longer distances and completely lost independent mobility in her thirties. Cognitive dysfunction was not a prominent feature, although mild cognitive decline was noted on repeated neuropsychometric testing. Brain imaging revealed generalized cerebral and cerebellar atrophy already in her thirties and was last repeated at age 59. Electrophysiology confirmed a cortical origin of the myoclonus. Scoliosis and areflexia were also noted; however, electromyography and nerve conduction studies were unremarkable. Currently, the patient lives in a residential care facility and is dependent for all the basic activities of daily living. Seizure control has been maintained through a combination of valproate, clonazepam, primidone, and levetiracetam with a reduction in myoclonus.","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0002505","obo:HP_0001250","obo:HP_0001336","obo:HP_0002059","obo:HP_0001272","obo:HP_0002066","obo:HP_0001284"],"previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"Negative for mutations in ATN1, mitochondrial A844G and A3243G","sex":"Female","variant":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ec946e5f-8ad5-4baa-aca5-c72b425e96ba_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fd96f6f8-8a57-4144-be27-249d01065f37_variant_evidence_item"}]}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria","strengthScore":1.0},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7ccfd1f5-2c58-459e-82c8-156912b66482_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/49f61762-2892-4198-9fe0-73a05c66345e","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/49f61762-2892-4198-9fe0-73a05c66345e_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33639315","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c0e63b5a-0783-4c05-85f3-29f46c7a03be","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_004287.5(GOSR2):c.82C>T (p.Gln28del)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA400016033"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1ff989ea-7688-4857-8575-41d3394bd69d","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1ff989ea-7688-4857-8575-41d3394bd69d_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"Protein failed to localize to the cis-golgi in patient primary skin fibroblast cell lines and yeast studies showed growth failure and lack of rescue by mutant protein [Corbett 2011PMID: 21549339].
