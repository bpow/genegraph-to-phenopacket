{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3f950298-af14-495a-a7d0-f3d12867629cv1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"The *CUL3* gene is located on chromosome 2 at q36.2 and encodes cullin-3, a scaffolding component of the Cullin-RING ligase (CRL) complex that belongs to a class of E3 ubiquitin ligases that mediate polyubiquitination of specific target proteins destined for degradation. E3 ligases containing CUL3 interact with KLHL3 and are involved in controlling blood pressure in the body by regulating the amount of WNK1 and WNK4 available.\n*CUL3* mutation was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant Pseudohypoaldosteronism, type II (PHA2E) in 2012 (Boyden et al., PMID: 22266938). This disorder is also known as Gordon syndrome, and familial hyperkalemic hypertension. The preferred disease name suggested for this disorder is ‘Familial hypertension with hyperkalaemia - CUL3’. The disorder is characterized by hyperkalemia, hypertension, metabolic acidosis and suppressed plasma renin levels despite a normal glomerular filtration rate. \n*CUL3* mutation has also been associated with autosomal dominant Neurodevelopmental disorder with or without autism or seizures. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, although both conditions have an AD inheritance, there is a difference in molecular mechanism and in clinical phenotype. Therefore, the following disease entities have been split into two distinct disease entities: Pseudohypoaldosteronism, type IIE (OMIM:614496) and Neurodevelopmental disorder with or without autism or seizures (OMIM:619239). Autosomal dominant Neurodevelopmental disorder with or without autism or seizures has been curated separately by the ID/Austim GCEP on 1/16/2021.\nNine variants (intronic, canonical splice, splice donor, splice acceptor, splice enhancer) that have been reported in 8 probands in 4 publications (PMIDs: 22266938, 24266877, 29511623, 34480842) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss of function. This gene-disease association is also supported by expression studies, protein interaction studies, and mouse models. (PMIDs: 29869755, 26286618). \nIn summary, *CUL3* is definitively associated with autosomal dominant familial hypertension with hyperkalaemia - CUL3. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.

Approximately 40K tag SNPs were extracted using Plink35. Analysis of\nlinkage was performed using Merlin36, specifying an autosomal dominant model\nwith no phenocopies. Variants from exome sequencing in regions of the genome\nthat were excluded (lod score of less than 2) were removed from further analysis, while\nthose that supported linkage were prioritized for further evaluation. In kindreds\nshowing potential recessive transmission of PHAII, SNP genotypes were examined\nfor regions of homozygosity, and linkage was performed specifying an autosomal\nrecessive model\n\nSanger Sequencing: PCR amplification and Sanger sequencing from genomic DNA was performed using standard methods. Primers were designed with Primer 337. Variants identified by exome sequencing were verified. All exons and flanking intronic sequences of KLHL3 and CUL3 were sequenced from all PHAII index cases. Previously unidentified mutations were discovered and verified by independent amplification and sequencing. Co-segregation of\nmutations with disease was determined by sequencing in all available kindred\nmembers. CUL3 exon 9 and its flanking intronic sequence was sequenced in\n150 unaffected unrelated controls, none of whom were found to harbour previously unidentified variants. It is noteworthy that because of lower or absent sequence coverage at or near intron–exon junctions, splice donor and acceptor mutations in CUL3 were suggested in two of the eleven PHAII exomes (SAMtools quality scores 96 and 75) but three branch site mutations were outside the exome sequence and one splice enhancer mutation was poorly covered (SAMtools quality score 3).","firstTestingMethod":"Linkage analysis","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/942190ac-dbb2-4803-a6b7-7bf8a202e539_variant_evidence_item"}}},"phenotypeFreeText":"Mean potassium was 7.5 +/- 0.9, and mean bicarbonate was 15.5 +/- 2.0.
