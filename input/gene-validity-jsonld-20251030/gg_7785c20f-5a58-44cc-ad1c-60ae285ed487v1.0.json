Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes genetic evidences (case-level data) and experimental evidences (functional alteration in non-patient cells).\n\nSummary of Case Level Data: 0.5 POINTS \nVariants in this gene have been reported in 1 proband in 1 publication (PMID: 33465109). \nAffected patients show thrombophilia, lower plasma levels of the anticoagulant protein free-Tissue Factor Pathway Inhibitor (f-TFPI) and higher of the antifibrinolytic protein Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor-1 (PAI-1).\n\nSummary of Experimental Data: 1.5 POINTS \nMorange et al showed that the expression of some genes known to regulate some hemostatic properties of endothelial cells (SERPINE1, PLAU, TFPI, SERPINB8) was altered by MAST2 knockdown (PMID: 33465109).\nMoreover, they showed that PAI-1 accumulated in the supernatant of ECV304 cells expressing mutant MAST2 (PMID: 33465109).\nFinally, silencing of MAST2 significantly increased TFPI promoter activity and reduced that of SERPINE1, while overexpression of Gln89 MAST2 decreased TFPI promoter activity and increased that of SERPINE1. Moreover, phosphorylation of AKT is increased (PMID: 33465109).\n\nIn summary, we obtained limited association of MAST2 with unclassified bleeding disorder.\n\nThis classification was approved by the ClinGen Hemostasis Thrombosis Working Group on June 4th 2025 (SOP Version 11).\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7785c20f-5a58-44cc-ad1c-60ae285ed487","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e0a83bd7-b175-4dbd-81e8-04e3f43c9380","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e0a83bd7-b175-4dbd-81e8-04e3f43c9380_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2025-06-16T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e0a83bd7-b175-4dbd-81e8-04e3f43c9380_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2025-06-16T18:46:59.798Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e0a83bd7-b175-4dbd-81e8-04e3f43c9380_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e0a83bd7-b175-4dbd-81e8-04e3f43c9380_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/71c71ab1-3634-4434-b240-74897b5118fb","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"MAST2
