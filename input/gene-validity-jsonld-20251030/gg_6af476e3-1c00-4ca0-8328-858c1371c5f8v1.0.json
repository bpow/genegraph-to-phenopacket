{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6af476e3-1c00-4ca0-8328-858c1371c5f8v1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"The relationship between *COQ2* and primary mitochondrial disease was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of January 30, 2023. The *COQ2* gene encodes the 4-hydroxybenzoate polyprenyltransferase protein. This enzyme is required for the synthesis of coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), which acts as an electron shuttle between enzyme complexes of the mitochondrial respiratory chain.  \n\nThe *COQ2* gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive primary mitochondrial disease in 2006 (PMID: 16400613). While various names have been given to the constellation of features seen in those with *COQ2*-related disease, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *COQ2* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to per the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included nine variants in eight probands across six publications (PMIDs: 16400613, 17855635, 17332895, 23631824, 15564041, 29637272). Common clinical manifestations include renal involvement (steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome), hypotonia, cerebral/cerebellar atrophy, encephalopathy and optic atrophy. Age of onset is typically in the first few years of life. Reduced levels of CoQ10 and reduced activities of complex I+III and II+III are commonly observed in patient tissues and cells. No segregation data were available.  Loss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by known biochemical function, a Drosophila model, and in vitro functional assays in patient cells demonstrating oxidative phosphorylation deficiencies due to variants in COQ2 (PMIDs: 33340416, 27493029, 21703546, 20495179, 26922674).  \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between *COQ2* and autosomal recessive primary mitochondrial disease. More than three years have elapsed since the first assertion of this gene-disease relationship, and no contradictory evidence has emerged. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on January 30, 2023 (SOP Version 9).
