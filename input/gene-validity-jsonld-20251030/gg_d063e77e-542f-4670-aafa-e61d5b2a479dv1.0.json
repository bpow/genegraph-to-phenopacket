The mechanism for the disease is haploinsufficiency and more than 20 unique loss-of-function variants have been reported in humans. Most variants occurred de novo, but some individuals inherited the variant from an affected parent. Variants in this gene have been reported in over 20 probands from a total of 3 publications, reaching the maximum score for genetic evidence (Guo et al. 2019, PMID: 31616000; Tian et al., 2019, PMID: 34861844; Tassano et al., 2020, PMID: 33160097). In addition to the case-level data, this gene-disease association is supported by experimental evidence, including animal models, protein interaction assays, and in vitro functional assays. \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between *TANC2* and autosomal dominant Intellectual developmental disorder with autistic features and language delay, with or without seizures.
