Variants in *SMC1A* have been reported in individuals with the following disease entities: Cornelia de Lange syndrome 2 (OMIM: 300590) and Developmental and epileptic encephalopathy 85, with or without midline brain defects (OMIM: 301044); both are associated with X-linked dominant inheritance. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting guidelines, we found no difference in inheritance pattern and overlapping phenotypes. Therefore, these two disease entities have been lumped into one disease entity, X-linked complex neurodevelopmental disorder.\n\nAt least 20 missense variants, 1 splicing, and 5 small deletions have been reported in humans. Variants have been found in at least 28 probands in 5 publications (PMIDs: 28166369, 26752331, 24124034, 1660407, 19701948). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by functional alteration in patient cells and protein interactions.\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *SMC1A* and X-linked complex neurodevelopmental disorder. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel on June 19, 2019 (SOP Version 6).","The SMC1A gene has been associated with X-linked complex neurodevelopmental disorder. Variants in SMC1A  have been reported in humans as early as 1995 (7757075, 7757074, 7757076). This disease association was made using case-level data and experimental data. At least 20 missense, 1 splicing, and 5 small deletions have been reported in humans. Variants have been found in at least 28 probands in 5 publications (28166369, 26752331, 24124034, 1660407, 19701948).

order to detect possible subtle differences in the DNAbinding\nproperties, we titrated the mutant dimers into the\nbinding reaction (Fig. 1A–E). Interestingly, in the range of\n108–360 nM, the mutant dimers bound DNA more efficiently\nthan the wild-type dimer, leaving less of the free substrate at\nthe bottom of the gel (Fig. 1A–E). Since the DNA-binding\nefficiency of a given dimer could vary slightly between the\nindividual protein preparations, we repeated the assay for\neach dimer variant three times with independently purified\nhinge dimers. We quantified the amount of unbound DNA at\nthe bottom of each lane by PhosphoImager and normalized\nit to the signal detected in the absence of the hinge protein\n(Figs 1 and 2). For the SMC1A-R496H/SMC3 and\nSMC1A-R496C/SMC3 mutants (Fig. 2A and B), the resulting\nmean values were lower than those of the wild-type. The\ndifference between the wild-type and SMC1A-E493A/SMC3\nor SMC1A/SMC3delE488 dimers was more pronounced\n(Fig. 2C and D). The wild-type hinge protein bound half of\nthe DNA substrate at 250 nM, whereas the SMC1-E493A/\nSMC3 and SMC1A/SMC3delE488 mutants bound 50% of\nDNA at or below 100 nM. At 250 nM, both mutants bound\n.90% of DNA. We conclude that among the mutations\nmapping in the hinge domain of SMC1A and SMC3, the substitution\nE493A in SMC1A and the deletion of E488 in SMC3\ncause the strongest increase in the affinity of the\nhinge-coiled-coil transition region to DNA.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18996922","rdfs:label":"Relative efficiency of DNA binding"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/58c3e8ad-9415-4762-89a9-83e381c6d0a2","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ac44833f-3764-48b1-95a1-74640da5bec4","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"CdLS cell lines were analyzed for spontaneous chromosome\naberrations and the results are reported in Figure 3.
