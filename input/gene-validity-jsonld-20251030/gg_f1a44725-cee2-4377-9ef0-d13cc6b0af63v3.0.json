No new evidence was has emerged that changes the overall score or classification of the curation. CAT encodes catalase, a peroxisomal antioxidant enzyme present in all aerobic cells. Acatalasemia is associated with absent or reduced catalase activity; however, patients exhibit no significant phenotypes. Since oxidative stress may have a role in the development of many chronic illnesses, acatalasemia is reported to be a risk factor for many diseases including type II diabetes mellitus, schizophrenia, cancer, arithritis and microcytic anemia. This curation considers acatalasemia as the disease entity, with the phenotype being reduced levels of catalase activity.\n\nCAT was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Acatalasemia in 1990 (Wen et al, PMID: 2308162). Variants in this gene include missense, splice region and frameshift variants. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. \n   \nSummary of Case Level Data (5.5 points):\nAt least 3 patients from 3 publications have been reported with homozygous variants in CAT (PMIDs: 2308162, 11001624). Several individuals carrying the same variants in the Japanese and Hungarian populations are reported, which may be due to a founder effect. The mechanism of disease is expected to be homozygous loss of function. Heterozygous individuals show intermediate levels of catalase activity.\n  \nSummary of experimental data (3 points):\nThis gene-disease association is supported by mouse and fly models (PMID: 15178682, 8349109).  \n  \nIn summary, the evidence to support the gene-disease relationship of CAT and Acatalasemia is moderate. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged.\n\nThis classification was originally approved by the ClinGen Peroxisomal GCEP on Oct 20, 2022. This gene-disease relationship was re-evaluated on February 7, 2025, and as a result of this re-evaluation, the classification did not change.
