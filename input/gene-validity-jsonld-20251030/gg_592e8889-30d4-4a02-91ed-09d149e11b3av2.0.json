The ACTB gene encodes beta-actin which plays a role in cellular processes,  including cell migration and division, cell shape, and the regulation of gene expression.  *ACTB*-associated syndromic thrombocytopenia is an autosomal dominant syndromic disorder characterized by developmental delay, mild intellectual disability, microcephaly, facial abnormalities, and thrombocytopenia with platelet anisotropy and enlarged platelets.  *ACTB* is also associated with Baraitser-Winter syndrome 1, Becker nevus syndrome, developmental malformation deafness/dystonia syndrome, and intellectual disability. *ACTB*-AST is curated as a unique disease, and to date, only variants in the 5th and 6th exon (pen/ultimate exons) of *ACTB* have been implicated in *ACTB*-associated syndromic thrombocytopenia. Evidence supporting this gene-disease curation includes case level data and experimental data.\n\nSummary of Case Level Data (5.8 points): Eight unique variants (missense, amino acid deletions, and frameshift) have been reported in humans, including instances of de novo variation. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 8 probands in 5 publications (Latham et al., 2018 PMID: 30315159; Nunoi et al., 1999 PMID: 10411937; Fouassier et al., 2023 PMID: 36564926; Atmar et al., 2022 PMID: 35572556; Marconi et al., 2023 PMID: 36519321). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 2 additional family members.\n\nSummary of Experimental Evidence (2.5 points): The gene-disease relationship is supported by expression, biochemical function, and functional alteration in patient cell experiments (Latham et al., PMID:30315159).\n\nIn summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship.  Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship.\n\nThis gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the ClinGen Hemostasis and Thrombosis (H/T) Gene Curation Expert Panel on 11/24/2021. It was reevaluated on 05/25/2022 and additional evidence was added (Greve et al., 2022 PMID: 35313204). On June 3rd, 2024, the gene-disease classification was re-evaluated again, and although additional scoreable genetic evidence has emerged, the classification did not change.\n\nOf note, there are two published cases in which variants in the 4th exon of *ACTB* are seen in individuals with a phenotype that partially overlaps the phenotype seen in individuals with *ACTB*-AST.  These variants are included in the curation, but are not scored at this time (Sandestig et al., 2019 PMID: 30733661; Megy et al., 2021 PMID: 34355501).\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/592e8889-30d4-4a02-91ed-09d149e11b3a","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9cee7fd2-09f7-41dc-9742-542917d856b0","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","changes":[{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"},{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},{"id":"cg:sopChange"},{"id":"cg:newEvidence"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9cee7fd2-09f7-41dc-9742-542917d856b0_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2024-06-07T12:20:57.341Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9cee7fd2-09f7-41dc-9742-542917d856b0_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2024-06-03T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["RecurationTiming","RecurationNewEvidence"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9cee7fd2-09f7-41dc-9742-542917d856b0_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4606f2d0-9052-4e1f-850b-a83c2df6ea89","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The variant c.899_916del, p.Ser300_Met305del does not have functional evidence to support its pathogenicity.
