At least 9 variants (missense, nonsense, frameshift, splice) have been reported in humans. HDAC8 was first associated with this disease in humans in 2012 (Deardorff et al.) and expands the phenotypic spectrum of classic CdLS to include delayed closure of the anterior fontanelle, hypertelorism, hooding of eyelids, a wide nose and dental anomalies (Kaiser et al. 2014, Parenti et al. 2016).\nSummary of Case Level Data: 12 points.\nAssociation is seen in at least 9 probands in 4 publications (22885700, 25102094, 22889856, 29519750). Variants in this gene usually occur de novo but segregation with disease was observed in 11 members of a Dutch family (Harakalova et al 2012). This gene-disease association is supported by in vitro functional assays, rescue in patient cells, and animal models.\nIn summary, HDAC8 is definitively associated with Cornelia de Lange syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.\nThis classification was approved by the ClinGen Autism and Intellectual Disability Working Group on 9/11/2018.","*HDAC8* was first reported in relation to X-linked Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS) in 2012 (Deardorff et al., PMID: 22885700). *HDAC8* variants expand the phenotypic spectrum of classic CdLS to include delayed closure of the anterior fontanelle, hypertelorism, hooding of eyelids, a wide nose and dental anomalies (PMIDs: 24403048, 26671848).\n\nNine variants (missense, nonsense, frameshift, splice) that have been reported in 9 probands in 4 publications (PMIDs: 22885700, 22889856, 25102094, 29519750) are included in this curation. Variants in this gene usually occur *de novo* but segregation with disease was observed in 11 members of a Dutch family (Harakalova et al., 2012, PMID: 22889856). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is reported to be loss of function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by *in vitro* functional assays, rescue in patient cells, and animal models.\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *HDAC8* and X-linked Cornelia de Lange syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel on September 11, 2018 (SOP Version 5)."],"dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a9c518fd-1903-4f2d-8bca-6b3c0548795d","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a7d29159-4c90-488e-a4e1-b006d70ae762","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a7d29159-4c90-488e-a4e1-b006d70ae762_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":["2018-09-10T22:00:00.000Z","2018-09-11T16:00:00.000Z"],"role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a7d29159-4c90-488e-a4e1-b006d70ae762_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2025-08-18T09:34:41.140Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"Segregation should only count for 2 points but this does not affect the scoring.","curationReasons":["ErrorClarification"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a7d29159-4c90-488e-a4e1-b006d70ae762_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a7d29159-4c90-488e-a4e1-b006d70ae762_seg_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/44087dc4-b4ca-4b4f-be89-dbe244320004_proband_segregation","type":"FamilyCosegregation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22889856","rdfs:label":"Dutch family","family":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/44087dc4-b4ca-4b4f-be89-dbe244320004","type":"Family","rdfs:label":"Dutch family","ethnicity":{"id":"cg:NotHispanicOrLatino"},"member":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ff403627-fb94-4cfb-9d6c-2820f90c73f5","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22889856","rdfs:label":"III:25","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":21,"detectionMethod":"We performed next-generation sequencing of all\nprotein coding sequences on the X chromosome (X-exome) in\nfive individuals from this family (three affected males (III:3;\nIII:12; III:25), one affected female (II:10), and one healthy\nfemale (III:18)).","ethnicity":{"id":"cg:NotHispanicOrLatino"},"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0000248","obo:HP_0001249","obo:HP_0000692","obo:HP_0000219","obo:HP_0000322","obo:HP_0000252","obo:HP_0001290","obo:HP_0000054","obo:HP_0000377","obo:HP_0009765","obo:HP_0005639","obo:HP_0000490","obo:HP_0000455","obo:HP_0200055","obo:HP_0000823","obo:HP_0000336","obo:HP_0000028"],"previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"Linkage was found\nusing markers from the WTS critical region, with a maximum\nlogarithm of odds (LOD) score of 4.93 at marker DXS983\n(chrX: 69,,448,069).

Cohesin is removed by either the prophase pathway or by separase-dependent cleavage of RAD21 at anaphase onset. Upon removal from chromatin, HDAC8 deacetylates SMC3 to facilitate release of RAD21 and Sororin, thereby efficiently “refreshing” cohesin “used” in the previous cell cycle.
