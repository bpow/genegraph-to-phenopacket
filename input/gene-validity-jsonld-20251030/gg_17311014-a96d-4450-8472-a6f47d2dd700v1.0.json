{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/17311014-a96d-4450-8472-a6f47d2dd700v1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"The relationship between *LIPT2* and primary mitochondrial disease was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of April 29, 2024. *LIPT2* encodes lipoyl(octanoyl) transferase 2, an enzyme important for lipoic acid biosynthesis.\n\nThe first and only report of variants in *LIPT2* being associated with autosomal recessive primary mitochondrial disease was in 2017 (PMID: 28757203). While various names have been given to the constellation of features seen in those with *LIPT2*-related disorders, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the LIPT2 phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework. \n\nEvidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included three missense variants in two probands from one publication (PMID: 28757203). Clinical features in affected individuals include severely delayed to absent psychomotor development, microcephaly, epilepsy, dystonia, spastic tetraparesis, and respiratory distress. Brain imaging showed cortical atrophy, leukodystrophy, delayed myelination, progressive thalamus and putamen abnormalities, and decreased gyrification of the cerebral hemispheres. Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex activity was reduced in skin fibroblasts.\n\nThe mechanism of disease is loss of function. This gene-disease association is also supported by the known biochemical function of LIPT2 in lipoic acid biosynthesis and functional studies in patient cells (PMID: 28803783). \n\nIn summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on April 29, 2024 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/17311014-a96d-4450-8472-a6f47d2dd700","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c8b411b3-7d8d-4fc4-89a5-f688f8117414","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c8b411b3-7d8d-4fc4-89a5-f688f8117414_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2025-03-14T13:32:09.644Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c8b411b3-7d8d-4fc4-89a5-f688f8117414_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2024-04-29T04:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c8b411b3-7d8d-4fc4-89a5-f688f8117414_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2680cbdc-69c1-4327-9ed5-f373ee6d1bcd_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/14c973b0-387a-4584-bb30-cdfa6d722b24","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The levels of the expected lipoyl-E2 subunits of PDHc and a-KGDHc were strongly decreased.","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/14c973b0-387a-4584-bb30-cdfa6d722b24_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"The levels of the expected lipoyl-E2 subunits of PDHc and a-KGDHc were strongly decreased.","functionalDataSupport":"Yes"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/14c973b0-387a-4584-bb30-cdfa6d722b24_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28757203","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e6d28fce-f421-4274-8888-1c5fa0d9fd34","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001144869.3(LIPT2):c.89T>C (p.Leu30Pro)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA224979330"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":0.25},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d845e1a8-d4c5-4650-aaf7-1ff262ebd488","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The levels of the expected lipoyl-E2 subunits of PDHc and a-KGDHc were strongly decreased.","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d845e1a8-d4c5-4650-aaf7-1ff262ebd488_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"The levels of the expected lipoyl-E2 subunits of PDHc and a-KGDHc were strongly decreased.","functionalDataSupport":"Yes"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d845e1a8-d4c5-4650-aaf7-1ff262ebd488_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28757203","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5e6137af-5ae0-4637-85b6-0b3fbc7f6648","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001144869.3(LIPT2):c.377T>G (p.Leu126Arg)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA224979286"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":0.25},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2680cbdc-69c1-4327-9ed5-f373ee6d1bcd","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28757203","rdfs:label":"Habarou - P1","allele":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5e6137af-5ae0-4637-85b6-0b3fbc7f6648"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e6d28fce-f421-4274-8888-1c5fa0d9fd34"}],"phenotypeFreeText":"This boy had truncal hypotonia, spastic tetraparesis, dystonia, epilepsy, microcephaly, and delayed psychomotor development​.
