This association was made using case-level and experimental data. More than a 30 pathogenic variants in this gene are reported in humans, ranging from partial deletions and duplications, nonsense, frameshift, missense and splicing variants. Congenital fibrinogen deficiency is characterized by quantitative and qualitative defects in fibrinogen. It may manifest as afibrinogenemia, dysfibrinogenemia and hypodysfibrinogenemia. Clinical symptoms include a bleeding diathesis and/or a thrombotic phenotype. \n\nSummary of Case Level Data (12 points): The association is seen in at least 10 probands in 8 publications (PMID: 23266225, 25629419, 24560896, 15070683, 12893758, 12161363, 23560673, 12511408). More case-level evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts) has been reached.\n\nThe mechanism for disease have been reported to be heterozygous as well as biallelic loss of function (PMID: 23266225, PMID:15070683). \n\nSummary of Experimental Data (3 points): FGB encodes the β subunit of the coagulation factor, fibrinogen, which is a hexamer of three subunit chains (PMID: 22836683). The Bβ fibrinopeptide along with Aα fibrinopeptide interact with thrombin, which catalyzes the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin (PMID: 15572239). It is synthesized in the liver and secreted into the plasma (PMID: 20921339). A zebrafish model that recapitulate fibrinogen deficiency is reported (PMID: 24098662).   \n\nIn summary, the FGB-Congenital fibrinogen deficiency gene-disease relationship is definitive. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hemostasis/Thrombosis GCEP on January 22, 2020. (SOP Version 7)\n\nLumping & Splitting information: OMIM assertions - (1) Congenital Afibrinogenemia (MIM: 202400); (2) Congenital Dysfibrinogenemia (MIM: 616004); (3) Congenital Hypofibrinogenemia (MIM: 202400). Orphanet assertions - (1)  Familial afibrinogenemia; (2)  Familial dysfibrinogenemia; (3) Familial hypodysfibrinogenemia; (4)  Familial hypofibrinogenemia. \nPer criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in molecular mechanism(s) underlying the disease entities: Congenital Afibrinogenemia, Congenital Dysfibrinogenemia, Congenital Hypodysfibrinogenemia and  Congenital Hypofibrinogenemia. These entities have been lumped together under Congenital Fibrinogen Deficiency.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/66c4c7ce-5eaa-4e33-b0f6-ce6d58dae0b5","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/638c1588-9674-4bc3-a39c-2fc8f8b0ef09","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/638c1588-9674-4bc3-a39c-2fc8f8b0ef09_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/638c1588-9674-4bc3-a39c-2fc8f8b0ef09_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2020-01-22T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/638c1588-9674-4bc3-a39c-2fc8f8b0ef09_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/638c1588-9674-4bc3-a39c-2fc8f8b0ef09_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1e1934d6-e97a-4ef3-a15c-5db0badb0813","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Although the model organism recapitulates the human phenotype, the evidence is scored reduced points since the gene alteration accomplished partial knock down.

However, transfecting minigene constructs with the variant showed that the major mRNA product was shorter (350 bp) and resulted from the use of a cryptic splice acceptor generated by the missense variant. The 466-bp wild-type transcript was the minor product. This transcript would undergo a frameshift and premature termination at residue 176.\n\nThe evidence is scored reduced points as the nonsense variant has been scored previously.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/25c6ff45-8cc4-45de-8ca2-0738030aee10","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15070683","rdfs:label":"Asselta_Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":57,"detectionMethod":"The entire fibrinogen gene cluster was sequenced.","firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypeFreeText":"Proband is noted to have moderate hemorrhagic symptoms.","phenotypes":"obo:HP_0011900","previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"Functional fibrinogen = 10 mg/dl; immunoreactive fibrinogen = 14.1 mg/dl (160 - 400 mg/dl)","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c88d752f-4d5e-4116-9e76-740bdbb402c9_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15070683","allele":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/53dce1e9-48cf-4d12-8e13-95da2f4a8809","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_005141.4(FGB):c.605T>A (p.Leu202Gln)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA126450"}},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0f24049b-813e-472b-81d3-9b7fa6f01bfa"}]},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:BiallelicCompoundHeterozygous"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3f3a4b60-27bc-40ca-97c2-d21559f3d352_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The proband was homozygous for the nonsense variant, Arg47Ter.
