While various names have been given to the constellation of features seen in those with *RMND1*-related disease, including autosomal recessive combined oxidative phosphorylation deficiency 11 (MIM 614922), pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *RMND1* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included eight unique variants (two missense, two frameshift, two consensus splice-site, one stop-gained and one extension variant) from six cases across four publications (PMIDs: 23022099, 25058219, 26395190, 27412952). The mechanism of disease appears to be loss of function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by a biochemical function to anchor or stabilize the mitochondrial ribosome near the sites of mRNA maturation, shRNA knockdown of RMND1 in HeLa cells showed significantly decreased complex I, III and IV activities and diminished mitochondrial protein synthesis (PMIDs: 23022099, 25604853). \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between *RMND1* and primary mitochondrial disease. This relationship has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on September 7, 2022 (SOP Version 9). \n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e3bf8b43-ca46-46d6-88a4-95cd51c6c0ef","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7e709765-beac-4f19-bcc0-181d0ce36f1b","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7e709765-beac-4f19-bcc0-181d0ce36f1b_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2022-09-07T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7e709765-beac-4f19-bcc0-181d0ce36f1b_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2022-12-14T22:28:17.272Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7e709765-beac-4f19-bcc0-181d0ce36f1b_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7e709765-beac-4f19-bcc0-181d0ce36f1b_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d373e809-5934-45eb-a020-fe31749837c6","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/df25765a-c103-4d4c-b6cc-98052701cd18","type":"Finding","dc:description":"reduced respiratory chain activities","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23022099","rdfs:label":"RMND1 knockdown in HeLa cells","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCellCultureModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7e709765-beac-4f19-bcc0-181d0ce36f1b_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ac0eda2d-2b36-47b6-a9c7-74a2fc6ab9a1","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6e7586d1-b358-40dd-947a-02e6704d5b80","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"An immunoblot analysis on immortalized patient fibroblasts, showed a marked reduction in the steady-state level of RMND1 (<5% of control).

She was admitted to hospital at 14 months of age due to hypotonia and elevated creatine kinase (580 U/L) during a febrile episode. Subsequently, she was admitted several times due to failure to thrive. She developed apparent hearing impairment and apparent intellectual disability. Echocardiography and cerebral MRI were normal. She was diagnosed with hypertensive renal impairment at 8 years of age, developed terminal renal failure at age 10 years and underwent renal transplant at 11 years of age. She is currently 17 years old, attends a school for the disabled and is able to perform simple household tasks under supervision.\nPatient 2 is the younger sister of patient 1. She had respiratory problems neonatally, and was discharged from hospital at three weeks of age. She had failure to thrive, apparent hearing impairment, moderate hypotonia, epilepsy, and apparent intellectual disability. A head MRI at age 8 years showed loss of white matter in the temporal lobes. Echocardiography was normal. At\n5 years of age she was found to have a severely elevated creatinine, and the GFR was 25 ml/min/1.72m2. She was severely hypertensive. Renal ultrasound showed normal kidney size and echogenicity. She underwent renal transplantation at the age of 13 years as the deterioration of renal function was very slow. She is currently 14 years old and attends a school for disabled.\nBoth sisters had proteinuric renal disease, but the histopathological diagnosis is unknown as kidney biopsies were not taken.","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Female","variant":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/15a38198-83ca-4c5d-ad67-95e416e0b737_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/edd86336-611c-4f31-adcb-f52267d9e787_variant_evidence_item"}]}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria","strengthScore":2.0}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":5457,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria9","strengthScore":16,"subject":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/qxN8IlTSe94","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0044970","gene":"hgnc:21176","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","websiteLegacyID":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/assertion_7e709765-beac-4f19-bcc0-181d0ce36f1b-","@context":{"@vocab":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"},"curationReasons":{"@type":"@vocab","@container":"@set"},"GCISnapshot":{"@type":"@id"},"dc:isVersionOf":{"@type":"@id"},"websiteLegacyID":{"@type":"@id"}}}
