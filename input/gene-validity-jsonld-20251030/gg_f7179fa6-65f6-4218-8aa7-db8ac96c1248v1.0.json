Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Variants in QDPR were first reported in humans with this disease as early as 1998 (Furukawa et al, PMID 9667588). Fifteen unique variants (missense, frameshift, nonsense, intronic, and in frame duplication) were curated in 15 probands from 5 publications (Howells et al, 1990, PMID 2116088; Smooker et al, 1995, PMID 7783174; Ikeda et al, 1997, PMID 9341885; Romstad et al, 2000, PMID 11153907; Ye et al, 2008, PMID 19099731). More evidence is available in the literature but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points ) has been reached. The mechanism for disease is loss of function. This gene-disease relationship is supported by the function of DHPR, which is consistent with the disease process (PMIDs 14114862, 3033643), as well as the finding of hyperphenylalaninemia in a null mouse model (Xu et al, 2014, PMID 24240194). In summary, QDPR is definitively associated with DHPR deficiency. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f7179fa6-65f6-4218-8aa7-db8ac96c1248","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3cd45f13-9412-4439-9b68-cf2e3d02a646","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3cd45f13-9412-4439-9b68-cf2e3d02a646_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10011","date":"2020-09-16T19:23:02.785Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3cd45f13-9412-4439-9b68-cf2e3d02a646_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10011","date":"2018-06-18T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3cd45f13-9412-4439-9b68-cf2e3d02a646_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/627f69e4-62ba-445d-8c44-bf5ff8ef8901_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"This patient is homozygous for a deep intronic variant in QDPR, c.436+2552A>G, which was shown by RT-PCR to resulting in activation of a cryptic splice site, insertion of intronic sequence and a premature stop codon.
