Variants in SMPX were first reported in humans with the disease as early as 2011 (Schraders et al., 21549342). At least six variants, nonsense and frameshift, have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported at least 8 probands in 5 publications (21549342, 21549336, 21893181, 22911656, 28542515). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in >100 additional family members. The families studied display an expected-X linked inheritance pattern where the hearing loss is earlier onset and more profound in males and slightly less penetrant in females. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. This gene-disease association is supported by expression studies. Loss of function of SMPX is expected to impact the ability of inner ear hair cells to conduct sound. It is important to note that there were SMPX null mice generated to investigate the effect of the deletion on muscle organization and function, however hearing loss was not studied in these mice (Palmer et al. 2001). In summary, SMPX is definitively associated with X-linked nonsyndromic hearing loss. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hearing Loss Working Group on 9/12/17.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/734cc52a-1cd9-4fc7-92d0-4615d165dcaa","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/29773bee-1f13-43f6-bda0-c5a646efccd7","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/29773bee-1f13-43f6-bda0-c5a646efccd7_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2017-09-12T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/29773bee-1f13-43f6-bda0-c5a646efccd7_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/29773bee-1f13-43f6-bda0-c5a646efccd7_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/29773bee-1f13-43f6-bda0-c5a646efccd7_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/da0bd6b8-abdd-46d3-bf2f-2f4a0ee33c87","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1f2e826b-8067-4628-ba8b-84ecf79c3b46","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Eurexpress database assay 006968 and Genepaint assay DC27 shows that SMPX is expressed in the inner ear of embryonic mice.

In the men, severe threshold deterioration mainly occurred during\nthe first two decades of life, especially at the higher frequencies. The women showed milder threshold\ndeterioration and more pronounced across-subjects and individual inter-aural variation, especially at 2\ne8 kHz. Longitudinal linear regression analysis demonstrated significant progression of at least two\nfrequencies in five individuals (3 men and 2 women).\nThe speech recognition scores of the mutation carriers with hearing impairment were decreased at\nrelatively young ages compared to a reference group of patients with only presbycusis, especially in men.\nHowever, all these patients tended to have better speech recognition scores than the presbycusis patients\nat matching PTA1,2,4 kHz levels","phenotypePositiveAllelePositive":15,"phenotypes":"obo:HP_0001730","proband":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ff43c9ac-7ef5-4d71-8d97-3aa3f640ec10"}},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/aaf6f063-c6f4-4359-adcc-463e6cfb7f11_proband_segregation","type":"FamilyCosegregation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22911656","rdfs:label":"Family 2024","estimatedLodScore":11.14,"family":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/aaf6f063-c6f4-4359-adcc-463e6cfb7f11","type":"Family","rdfs:label":"Family 2024","ethnicity":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/"},"member":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8fefec1f-19ea-486f-976e-aadfab39289b"}},"meetsInclusionCriteria":true,"phenotypeFreeText":"","phenotypePositiveAllelePositive":38,"proband":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8fefec1f-19ea-486f-976e-aadfab39289b"},"sequencingMethod":{"id":"cg:CandidateGeneSequencing"}},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/120c997e-a094-4926-bc14-aac4809ef1d1_proband_segregation","type":"FamilyCosegregation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28542515","rdfs:label":"LD-101 Family","estimatedLodScore":2.11,"family":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/120c997e-a094-4926-bc14-aac4809ef1d1","type":"Family","rdfs:label":"LD-101 Family","ethnicity":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/"},"member":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/880f7c1e-4b32-4340-87db-2f7ea8184b39"}},"meetsInclusionCriteria":true,"phenotypeFreeText":"","phenotypePositiveAllelePositive":8,"phenotypes":["obo:HP_0012712","obo:HP_0008596","obo:HP_0000399","obo:HP_0011476"],"proband":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/880f7c1e-4b32-4340-87db-2f7ea8184b39"},"sequencingMethod":{"id":"cg:AllGenesSequencing"}},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e0976266-7b50-41d5-a7ed-c0f220e39d15_proband_segregation","type":"FamilyCosegregation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21549336","rdfs:label":"Huebner_1","family":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e0976266-7b50-41d5-a7ed-c0f220e39d15","type":"Family","rdfs:label":"Huebner_1","ethnicity":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/"},"member":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/29d60413-e324-4d91-8b5a-068701cb237e"}},"meetsInclusionCriteria":true,"phenotypeFreeText":"Postlingual NSHL age of onset 3-7 in males.
