SLC25A15 encodes a mitochondrial ornithine transporter (ORNT1) which catalyzes the transport of the L-isomers of ornithine, citrulline, lysine and arginine across the mitochondrial inner membrane. Affected individuals present with the classic biochemical triad of abnormalities – hyperornithinemia, hyperammonemia, and homocitrullinuria. Age of onset and clinical symptoms are variable ranging from a mild form with learning difficulties and mild neurological involvement, to a more severe form with coma, lethargy, hepatic dysfunction, and seizures. Biallelic variants in SLC25A15 were first reported in 1999 (Camacho et al, (PMID 10369256). Since then, more than 30 variants have been reported in SLC25A15 (Martinelli et al, 2015, PMID 25874378). Data from 12 probands who are homozygous or compound heterozygous for SLC25A15 variants were curated, including 14 unique variants (missense, nonsense, frameshift, inframe insertion) (Tsujino et al, 2000, PMID 10805333; Korman et al, 2004, PMID 14759633; Camacho et al, 2006, PMID 16940241; Fecarotta et al, 2006, PMID 16601889; Torisu et al, 2006, PMID 16376511; Debray et al, 2008, PMID  18978333; Tessa et al, 2009, PMID 19242930; Slifverberg et al, 2018, PMID 30243302). One of these variants, p.Phe188del is a founder variant in French-Canadians, and another, p.Arg179X, is commonly seen in Japanese patients with HHH syndrome. This gene-disease relationship is supported by the biochemical function of SLC25A15 which is consistent with the biochemical abnormalities observed in individuals with ornithine translocase deficiency (HHH syndrome) (Camacho et al, 1999, PMID 10369256; Fiermonte et al, 2003, PMD 12807890), functional alteration experiment that identified critical residues for transport activity and substrate specificity (Monné et al, 2012, PMID 22262851), rescue experiments in cultured fibroblasts from patients with HHH syndrome (Camacho et al, 1999, PMID 10369256), and yeast lacking the ornithine transporter (Morizono et al, 2005, PMID 16256388). In summary, SLC25A15 is definitively associated with ornithine translocase deficiency (HHH syndrome). This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This clinical validity classification was approved by the ClinGen Aminoacidopathy Gene Curation Expert Panel.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/046e84d9-d0de-4d19-8304-ffcf459b9e15","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e5cb32c9-d506-484f-b023-1c4f17ef0d93","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"},"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e5cb32c9-d506-484f-b023-1c4f17ef0d93_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10011","date":"2020-09-16T19:23:07.492Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e5cb32c9-d506-484f-b023-1c4f17ef0d93_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10011","date":"2019-12-04T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e5cb32c9-d506-484f-b023-1c4f17ef0d93_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b3025cca-0b21-4691-bfbb-c22439b3b246_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"This individual is compound heterozygous for a missense variant, p.Gly113Ser, and a nonsense variant, p.Gln238X, in SLC25A15.

However ORC2 has a broader a broader substrate specificity than ORC1, and ORC1 is 3 times more active. Because SLC25A15 (ORC1, ORNT1) transports citrulline better than ORNT2 (ORC2) and because it is more abundant than ORNT2 (ORC2) in liver, SLC25A15 is likely to carry out the important function of exchanging cytosolic ornithine and mitochondrial citrulline, thus providing an essential link in the urea cycle between enzyme activities in the cytosol and others in the mitochondrial matrix.  It has been proposed that the presence of ORC2 could ameliorate the severity of the phenotype in individuals with HHH syndrome. Of note, no pathogenic variants have been identified in ORC2. Impaired transport of ornithine from the cytosol to the mitochondrial matrix would disrupt the urea cycle at the level of the ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) reaction, and prevent ornithine degradation in the urea cycle. Therefore, ornithine transporter deficiency would be expected to result in increased ammonia and ornithine.

Therefore, deficiency of ORNT1 (encoded by SLC25A15) is expected to reduce the level of ornithine in mitochondria, and increase ornithine level in the cytosol. The decreased level of mitochondrial ornithine reduces the urea cycle rate since ornithine is required by ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) to drive the urea cycle.

However, all of the tested variants of Glu-77 and Asn-78, as well as the nonconservative substitutions R179A, E180A, E180Q, R275A, and R275Q, resulted in a severe deleterious impact on transport activity.
