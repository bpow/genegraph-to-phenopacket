{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/df122e9b-1acc-428d-92ad-55252270c5c6v2.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"The DIABLO gene has been associated with autosomal dominant nonsyndromic hearing loss using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of 9/21/21. This association was made using case-level data only. At least 3 missense variants have been reported in humans. DIABLO was first associated with this disease in humans as early as 2011 (Cheng et al. 2011; PMID: 21722859). Association is seen in at least 2 probands in  publications (PMIDs: 21722859, 26969326). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 17 additional family members. This gene-disease association is supported by in vitro functional assays. In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease association. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease association. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hearing Loss Working Group on 12/19/2017. It was reevaluated on 9/21/2021 (SOP v8). As a result of this reevaluation, the classification did not change. Although new literature was published (PMID: 26969326), the scoring still corresponded to a limited gene-disease relationship.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/df122e9b-1acc-428d-92ad-55252270c5c6","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f5903c3b-b2d7-4c14-b196-37533187d807","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","changes":[{"id":"cg:newEvidence"},{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},{"id":"cg:sopChange"},{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f5903c3b-b2d7-4c14-b196-37533187d807_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2021-09-21T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f5903c3b-b2d7-4c14-b196-37533187d807_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2022-03-09T17:11:20.734Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f5903c3b-b2d7-4c14-b196-37533187d807_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f5903c3b-b2d7-4c14-b196-37533187d807_seg_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/73024579-bd21-4426-9a05-6eb37a23d113_proband_segregation","type":"FamilyCosegregation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21722859","rdfs:label":"HN - W078","family":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/73024579-bd21-4426-9a05-6eb37a23d113","type":"Family","rdfs:label":"HN - W078","member":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/17dc9d37-8f66-4fc0-ab61-88829b963246","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21722859","rdfs:label":"HN-W078 Proband","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fa90536b-dda8-4236-9a03-be1bf9be6d4a","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001371333.1(DIABLO):c.377C>T (p.Ser126Leu)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/30449"}},"detectionMethod":"Linkage region contained 61 genes - Candidate sequencing of 6 genes based on expression in the ear","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0008615","obo:HP_0000360","obo:HP_0000408"],"sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f6a29316-5212-4873-aca9-5cdcade95f1b_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21722859","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fa90536b-dda8-4236-9a03-be1bf9be6d4a"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Heterozygous"}}}},"meetsInclusionCriteria":true,"phenotypeNegativeAlleleNegative":15,"phenotypePositiveAllelePositive":18,"phenotypes":["obo:HP_0000408","obo:HP_0000360","obo:HP_0008615"],"proband":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/17dc9d37-8f66-4fc0-ab61-88829b963246"},"publishedLodScore":5.66,"sequencingMethod":{"id":"cg:CandidateGeneSequencing"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValiditySegregationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ace22b65-68e5-4727-82f1-8b849555c42d","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ace22b65-68e5-4727-82f1-8b849555c42d_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26969326","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/13a2062f-cefc-47ac-a938-1d784a442271","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NC_000012.12:g.122208460T>A (GRCh38)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA387041034"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:AlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Heterozygous"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":0.1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f6a29316-5212-4873-aca9-5cdcade95f1b","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f6a29316-5212-4873-aca9-5cdcade95f1b_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f6a29316-5212-4873-aca9-5cdcade95f1b_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"Cotransfected with WT gene in HeLa cells, S71L DIABLO (which is location of variant in mature, cleaved protein) enhanced the degradation of WT DIABLO likely by heterodimerizing with it.
