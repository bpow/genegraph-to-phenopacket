ICOS belongs to the CD28 and CTLA-4 cell-surface receptor family. It forms homodimers and plays an important role in cell-cell signaling, immune responses, and regulation of cell proliferation. ICOS was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive CVID in 2003 (Grimbacher et al,  PMID: 12577056). Variants reported in this gene thus far include deletion, frameshift and missense variants. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. \n   \nSummary of Case Level Data (12 points):\nThere have been at least 10 patients from 8 publications, till date, reported with homozygous variants in ICOS (PMID: 12577056, 15507387, 26399252, 25678089, 19380800, 28861081, 16384931, 31858365). The mechanism of disease is reported to be biallelic loss of function. \n\nSummary of experimental data (5.5 points):\nThis gene-disease association is supported by in-vitro functional assays and animal models. ICOS binds to its ligand, ICOSL, through critical residues (PMID: 11956294). ICOS is shown to interact with PIK3R1 (PMID: 17014982). At least three different mouse models are shown to recapitulate human phenotypes such as hypogammaglobulinemia, Ig class-switch defects, and impaired germinal center reactions, defective antibody response and autoimmunity (PMID: 11343123, 11343122, 11238604, 11343121). Impaired ICOS/ICOSL interactions compromise NK cell activation and NK cell response (PMID: 31283790).\n  \nIn summary, the evidence to support the gene-disease relationship of ICOS and Common variable immunodeficiency is definitive. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/329ed8cd-7239-40bc-8a9a-18622ee98157","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/51864ec9-27d9-4a94-9524-d6828b17361d","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/51864ec9-27d9-4a94-9524-d6828b17361d_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10080","date":"2022-12-19T22:23:08.109Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/51864ec9-27d9-4a94-9524-d6828b17361d_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10080","date":"2022-11-29T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/51864ec9-27d9-4a94-9524-d6828b17361d_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/51864ec9-27d9-4a94-9524-d6828b17361d_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0424f068-ca83-4307-9716-f587524b3bb5","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/23456fab-322f-4b03-b26a-e040633a3bb7","type":"Finding","dc:description":"T lymphocytes developed normally in the thymus in the absence of ICOS and exhibited normal CD4 and CD8 cell populations in lymph nodes and spleen.

ICOS+/+ mice with the C57BL/6x129 F2 genetic background only exhibited mild disease, but ICOS-/- mice on the same genetic background uniformly developed greatly enhanced disease, and 50% of the tested mice died after disease induction.

ICOS-/- and ICOS+/+ mice had comparable IgM levels but ICOS-/- mice had modestly elevated IgG3.

CTLA-4 was also fully induced, as determined by intracellular staining of activated T cells. PBMCs from proband were stained with soluble ICOS-L Ig-fusion reagent, which specifically binds correctly folded ICOS. No ICOS-specific signal was detected on CD4+ or CD8+ T cells. ICOS-L expression on patient B cells was elevated.","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6a64d4dc-e7f4-4dee-ba55-ccaa8faf6a2a_variant_evidence_item"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria","strengthScore":3},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/51864ec9-27d9-4a94-9524-d6828b17361d_seg_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d54c43a0-fd0b-46d8-97b5-a46d46a7767d_proband_segregation","type":"FamilyCosegregation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15507387","rdfs:label":"Salzer_Family D","estimatedLodScore":1.33,"family":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d54c43a0-fd0b-46d8-97b5-a46d46a7767d","type":"Family","rdfs:label":"Salzer_Family D","member":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c8bf5ab4-a67e-4d5d-b329-ede7f9511596"}},"meetsInclusionCriteria":true,"phenotypeFreeText":"All patients were diagnosed with CVID according to ESID criteria","phenotypeNegativeAlleleNegative":1,"phenotypePositiveAllelePositive":3,"proband":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c8bf5ab4-a67e-4d5d-b329-ede7f9511596"},"sequencingMethod":{"id":"cg:CandidateGeneSequencing"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValiditySegregationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":5517,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria9","strengthScore":17.5,"subject":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b_up3OIkuuY","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0015517","gene":"hgnc:5351","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","websiteLegacyID":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/assertion_51864ec9-27d9-4a94-9524-d6828b17361d-","@context":{"@vocab":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"},"curationReasons":{"@type":"@vocab","@container":"@set"},"GCISnapshot":{"@type":"@id"},"dc:isVersionOf":{"@type":"@id"},"websiteLegacyID":{"@type":"@id"}}}
