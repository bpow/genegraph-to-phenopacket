Six frameshift variants that have been reported in nine probands in four publications (PMIDs: 14634649, 15024694, 15782410, 16493439) are included in this curation. Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 28 additional male family members, as well as in unaffected female carriers. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is loss of function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by a conditional knockout mouse model with significantly reduced brain weight (PMID: 25070536) and functional studies demonstrating the pathogenicity of loss-of-function variants (PMIDs: 23512658, 24781215, 28073926).\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *PQBP1*​ and X-linked Renpenning syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel on November 7, 2018 (SOP Version 6).","The relationship between PQBP1 and X-linked Renpenning syndrome was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of 9/27/18. Variants in PQBP1 were first reported in humans with this disease as early as 2003 (Kalscheuer et al.​). At least 7 frameshift variants, and additional missense and nonsense variants, have been reported in at least 9 male probands in 4 publications (PMIDs: 14634649, 15782410, 15024694, 16493439, 16740914, 20950397, 26411299, 25167861). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 28 additional male family members, as well as unaffected female carriers. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for \"predicted or proven null variants\" for genetic evidence (10 pts) has been reached. This gene-disease association is supported by a conditional knockout mouse model with significantly reduced brain weight (PMID: 25070536) as well as functional studies demonstrating the pathogenicity of loss-of-function variants (PMIDs: 23512658, 24781215, 28073926). In summary, PQBP1​ is definitively associated with X-linked Renpenning syndrome.
