This condition is characterized by severe developmental delay, seizures, and white matter abnormalities with normal plasma and cerebrospinal fluid biochemistry. Of note, this gene has also been implicated in autosomal recessive congenital brain dysgenesis due to glutamine synthetase deficiency. This condition has been assessed separately by the Aminoacidopathy GCEP.

Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data determining the functional effect of variants. The functional assays discussed in this curation show stable enzymatic activity of the resultant transcript starting at methionine 18 in vitro and insensitivity to negative feedback from high glutamine levels in dermal fibroblasts from affected individuals (PMID: 38579670). The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be gain of function due to loss of sensitivity to negative feedback (PMID: 38579670). \n\nIn summary, there is moderate evidence to support the relationship between *GLUL* and autosomal dominant developmental and epileptic encephalopathy. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Epilepsy GCEP on January 7, 2025 (SOP Version 11).\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e8aca4e9-af57-40a3-aeb5-bd654456b926","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fd1658f4-ac4f-47e2-91a1-a127550a5ee9","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fd1658f4-ac4f-47e2-91a1-a127550a5ee9_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10005","date":"2025-01-07T18:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fd1658f4-ac4f-47e2-91a1-a127550a5ee9_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10005","date":"2025-03-18T16:38:43.229Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fd1658f4-ac4f-47e2-91a1-a127550a5ee9_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fd1658f4-ac4f-47e2-91a1-a127550a5ee9_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a708a086-d826-4ac3-8e41-ac7072844ffc","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a708a086-d826-4ac3-8e41-ac7072844ffc_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"This variant results in a start-loss.
