{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/89a239b7-ef53-47c4-86f6-30698e902b56v3.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"*NSUN2* was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive syndromic intellectual disability in 2012 (Abbasi-Moheb et al., PMID: 22541559; Khan et al., PMID: 22541562; Martinez et al.,  PMID: 22577224). The clinical presentation includes global developmental delay, intellectual disability, microcephaly, short stature, delayed puberty, infertility, dysmorphic facial features and a wide-range of ocular-related abnormalities. \n\nTwelve *NSUN2* variants (splice site, nonsense, frameshift, missense) that have been reported in 11 probands are included in this curation. Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 14 additional family members. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. Both consanguineous and non-consanguineous families from different ethnicities have been reported. The mechanism for disease is biallelic loss of function. \n\nOf note, an individual with a homozygous frameshift variant in *NSUN2*, scored here, was described as having facial features reminiscent of Noonan syndrome (PMID: 24102521). This assertion was assessed separately by the ClinGen RASopathy Gene Curation Expert Panel and the relationship between *NSUN2* and RASopathies was disputed. \n\n*NSUN2* encodes an RNA methyltransferase that modifies transfer RNAs crucial for protein synthesis. Experimental evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes knockout models in mice (PMIDs: 22144916, 25063673, 3438972) and drosophila (PMID: 22541559). \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between *NSUN2* and syndromic intellectual disability. This gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel on February 6, 2019. It was re-evaluated on October 18, 2023. As a result of this reevaluation, the classification increased from Moderate to Definitive with the addition of new literature (SOP Version 9).

A MRI of the brain was unremarkable. \nBy three years of age his motor skills, proprioception, and kinesthetic awareness were all at the level expected for a 24-month-old. Currently at age four, the patient remains nonverbal and demonstrates chronic dysphagia, difficulty walking, and hearing problems. Spontaneous improvement in his epiblepharon was noted in both eyes.","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0011225","obo:HP_0002015","obo:HP_0001252","obo:HP_0001999","obo:HP_0001263","obo:HP_0001249","obo:HP_0000486","obo:HP_0000365","obo:HP_0001270","obo:HP_0025144"],"previousTesting":false,"sex":"Male","variant":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f9df583a-392e-424a-b62a-9dd116678bd7_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35126837","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e727a26f-ff13-4596-a11c-39ba7f6dccdb"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"}},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a4398ae2-e0a3-40d8-81f4-5424dc6a733e_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35126837","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c94463d5-8d9d-4cbc-9ae8-563a74fb58ae"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"}}]},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f9df583a-392e-424a-b62a-9dd116678bd7","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f9df583a-392e-424a-b62a-9dd116678bd7_variant_evidence_item"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a4398ae2-e0a3-40d8-81f4-5424dc6a733e","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a4398ae2-e0a3-40d8-81f4-5424dc6a733e_variant_evidence_item"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":0.1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria","strengthScore":1.6},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c752aee9-6241-43d0-9f67-00dd39210f50_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c752aee9-6241-43d0-9f67-00dd39210f50"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ab9bcca6-6c84-4ec2-a07b-673334df315e","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Applied a cap of 2 points as per ID/ASD GCEP recommendation to avoid excessive scoring for each case.","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ab9bcca6-6c84-4ec2-a07b-673334df315e_variant_evidence_item"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/30275586-58aa-48b3-8999-573f82bf42b8","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Applied a cap of 2 points as per ID/ASD GCEP recommendation to avoid excessive scoring for each case.","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/30275586-58aa-48b3-8999-573f82bf42b8_variant_evidence_item"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f53c52ca-bfa7-4582-97de-46f4b9fffbb0_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f53c52ca-bfa7-4582-97de-46f4b9fffbb0"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/72238d3e-e3fc-4ea0-92f6-5c4b8e66c2b3","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Applied a cap of 2 points per variant as per ID/ASD GCEP recommendation to avoid excessive scoring.","calculatedScore":3.0,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/72238d3e-e3fc-4ea0-92f6-5c4b8e66c2b3_variant_evidence_item"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e987e19c-34b8-4d59-850e-bef9d283dd2c_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e987e19c-34b8-4d59-850e-bef9d283dd2c"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e4324a13-1f3b-425c-baa8-ba6adf8fef17","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Downgraded to 0.5 points due to presence of homozygous variant in a consanguineous family","calculatedScore":1.0,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e4324a13-1f3b-425c-baa8-ba6adf8fef17_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e4324a13-1f3b-425c-baa8-ba6adf8fef17_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"This variant was shown to impair proper cellular localization of the NSUN2 protein;
