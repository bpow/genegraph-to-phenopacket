{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/152ff76a-8b2a-4dcf-af23-dda71389523dv2.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"FLT4 (formerly VEGFR3) encodes a tyrosine kinase receptor that plays a role in angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis and was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant Lymphatic malformation 1 (Milroy disease) in 2000 (Karkkainen MJ et al., Irrthum A et al.) and autosomal dominant congenital heart defects in 2017 (Jin et al., PMID: 28991257). Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found differences in molecular mechanism(s) (LoF vs GoF) and phenotypic variability between reported phenotypic assertions. Therefore, the following disease entities have been split into multiple disease entities; Congenital heart defects, multiple types, 7 (OMIM:618780) and Lymphatic malformation 1 (OMIM:153100). The split curation for autosomal dominant Lymphatic malformation 1 (OMIM:153100) has been performed separately by Prenatal GCEP. \n\nCongenital heart defects, multiple types, 7 is primarily characterized by tetralogy of Fallot (ToF) usually accompanied by pulmonary atresia, which might show incomplete penetrance in variant carriers. Seven probands including 2 prenatal presentations are included in this curation along with affected family members (PMIDs: 28991257, 30232381, 33142350, 34905512) in addition to a large case-control study reporting statistically significant enrichment of heterozygous loss-of-function variants in individuals with ToF compared to ethnically matched individuals without ToF (PMID: 30582441). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. To date no individual was reported to have lymphedema (predominantly in the lower extremities) observed in Lymphatic malformation 1 (Milroy disease). There is no data yet to assess whether there is an increased risk for lymphedema (i.e. chylothorax) development before or after surgery in individuals carrying loss-of-function FLT variants. This gene-disease relationship is also preliminarily supported by experimental evidence; expression studies in fetal tissue samples demonstrating expression in the epicardium and endothelia of the large blood vessels (PMIDs: 8245783) and knockout mice lacking the intact FLT4 gene demonstrating a defect in the vasculature formation that is not compatible with life (PMIDs: 9794766). Of note, heterozygous mice models are phenotypically and embryonically normal, however, zygosity discrepancy between humans and animal models is not uncommon. In summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between FLT4 and autosomal dominant Congenital heart defects, multiple types, 7. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in the clinical diagnostic settings and supported by preliminary experimental evidence. This classification was approved by the Prenatal GCEP on 12/14/2022 (SOP version 9).
