Clinical features include intellectual disability, social and cognitive impairment, epilepsy, dystonia, and behavioral disorders. Variants in *GRIK2* have also been associated with autosomal dominant complex neurodevelopmental disorder. This gene-disease relationship has been assessed separately.\n\nAutosomal recessive loss of function variants in *GRIK2* were first reported in relation to complex neurodevelopmental disorder as early as 2007 (Motazacker et al., PMID: 17847003). The first described variant, a complex null variant (DEL/INV, EX7-11) functionally shown to lead to loss of the protein function, was identified in a consanguineous family with autosomal recessive intellectual disability and no other observed neurological disorders or physical dysmorphism via direct sequencing of probands and some parents and unaffected siblings (PMID: 17847003). A second variant (p.Arg198Ter) [R198X]), predicted to result in nonsense-mediated decay of truncated protein, was identified in 2 homozygous siblings, born to consanguineous parents, who were affected by varying degrees of social and cognitive delay/impairment, epilepsy, dystonia and behavioral disorders (Cordoba et al., PMID: 25039795).\n\nBased on the studies described, *GRIK2* variants inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern can result in a loss of function, related to neurodevelopmental disorders such as intellectual disability, social and cognitive delay/impairment, epilepsy, dystonia and behavioral disorders. Based on the volume of evidence in the literature, the genetic evidence was scored 5.5 points.\n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by behavioral phenotypes described in 5 studies characterizing global knockout mouse models backcrossed to varying degrees in 129/Sv and/or C57BL/6 lines (PMIDs: 9580260, 15673679, 18332879, 24753134, 11182092), as well as a physiological characterization of a global KO mouse model showing reduced long-term potentiation and impaired short-term synaptic facilitation. A conditional knockout of *GRIK2* in adult-born dentate granule cells (abDGCs) in 8-9 week mice resulted in impaired spatial discrimination, increased depolarization of EGABA, and elevated GABAergic synaptic events at 21 dpi, although the relevance to clinical phenotypes is unclear (PMID: 34551304).\n\nIn summary, there is moderate evidence to support the relationship between autosomal recessive loss of function variants in *GRIK2* and complex neurodevelopmental disorder. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel on February 10, 2022 (SOP Version 8).\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b9f09b14-a558-4686-aea8-bcc9ce6c2813","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1939b90b-f1e4-4426-9f8c-5526f9003f10","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","changes":{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1939b90b-f1e4-4426-9f8c-5526f9003f10_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2023-09-01T17:41:22.998Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1939b90b-f1e4-4426-9f8c-5526f9003f10_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2022-02-10T07:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1939b90b-f1e4-4426-9f8c-5526f9003f10_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1939b90b-f1e4-4426-9f8c-5526f9003f10_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e537fd22-42c2-4a8b-9f81-81c6ab7f6e74","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Impaired long-term potentiation and short-term synaptic facilitation could be consistent with deficits leading to neurodevelopmental disorders seen in humans with GRIK2 variants, but no behavioral studies were performed in the mice in this study.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0d75638e-d097-41df-8f63-ee05ea2fdc42","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Not addressed in this study","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11182092","rdfs:label":"Mossy fiber synaptic transmission in kainate receptor KO mic","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1798dec4-cd4a-4a7e-a154-cdf3a9607ab0","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/88f0ee99-116e-43e0-9e99-6d2f9cdf7c51","type":"Finding","dc:description":"GluK2 is a subunit of kainate receptors (KARs).
