The proteins of RAD51 family members are known to be involved in the homologous recombination and DNA repair. RAD51C protein can interact with other RAD51 paralogs and is reported to be involved in Holliday junction resolution. RAD51C has also been linked to autosomal recessive Fanconi anemia complementation group O.  Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we have split the autosomal recessive Fanconi anemia complementation group O into separate curations due to phenotypic variability and/or different inheritance patterns. Therefore, this curation solely focuses on autosomal dominant RAD51C-related cancer predisposition including familial ovarian cancer, triple negative breast cancer and ER negative breast cancers. This gene-disease relationship has been studied in at least eight case-control studies at the aggregate variant level . These case-control studies suggested significant increased risk for ovarian cancer, triple negative breast cancer and ER negative breast cancers in monoallelic RAD51C variant carriers compared to controls (12 points) (PMIDs: 26261251, 26720728, 30099541, 31341520, 32091585, 33471991, 35084436, 35172496). This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence including expression and biomedical function studies (1.5 points; PMIDs: 20400963, 22167183, 23047548). The cells with loss of RAD51C or expressing RAD51C variants exhibited a marked increase in the frequency of interstrand cross-links and double strand breaks. Methylation of RAD51C promoter was also observed in the ovarian tumor samples. In summary, RAD51C is definitively associated with autosomal dominant RAD51C-related cancer predisposition. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This gene-disease pair was originally evaluated as definitive for familial ovarian cancer on 04/12/2017 and as disputed for hereditary breast carcinoma on 05/10/2017 by the Breast/Ovarian Cancer GCEP. This re-curation as definitive was approved by the ClinGen Hereditary Cancer GCEP on 03/22/2024 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/058a65d0-b7ba-4426-89f9-43ad335f1895","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/31cb27be-dd32-4bb7-86bd-43c4b1eabaf5","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/31cb27be-dd32-4bb7-86bd-43c4b1eabaf5_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10023","date":"2024-08-29T20:38:06.456Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/31cb27be-dd32-4bb7-86bd-43c4b1eabaf5_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10023","date":"2024-08-29T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"RAD51C is definitively associated with autosomal dominant RAD51C-related cancer predisposition.
