Variants in TTC19 were first reported in humans with Leigh syndrome spectrum as early as 2011 (PMID: 21278747). More than 10 unique variants predicted to cause a loss of or reduced function of the protein have been reported in ClinVar, suggesting homozygous loss of function is the mechanism of disease for this gene. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. At least eight probands with TTC19  pathogenic variants with Leigh syndrome spectrum have been reported in 6 publications (PMID: 25452764, 25887401, 25772319 ,29961508, 21278747, 24397319) to reach a max case-level evidence score of 12. This gene-disease association is further supported by evidence of TTC19 protein interaction with other genes associated with Leigh syndrome spectrum, TTC19 expression in brain, mitochondrial alterations in patient cell lines, and a TTC19 mouse model and fly model collectively exhibiting neuroimaging, biochemical, and neurocognitive phenotype that recapitulates symptoms of Leigh syndrome spectrum reaching a max experimental score of 6 pts. In summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between TTC19 and autosomal recessive Leigh syndrome spectrum. More than three years have elapsed from the first proposal of the association to reach a definitive classification. This classification was approved by the NICHD U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on August 21, 2019 (SOP Version 7).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5f228bd5-e68c-4045-b640-0f3c65766fac","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8dc9dcb6-1f63-41b1-80f1-a0f2a87b5ec4","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8dc9dcb6-1f63-41b1-80f1-a0f2a87b5ec4_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2019-09-19T16:01:32.570Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8dc9dcb6-1f63-41b1-80f1-a0f2a87b5ec4_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8dc9dcb6-1f63-41b1-80f1-a0f2a87b5ec4_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8dc9dcb6-1f63-41b1-80f1-a0f2a87b5ec4_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f9482d4c-fbda-4260-b66d-a69bf787bd00","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"As per Leigh Working group model scoring rubric, TTC19 KO mouse received 2.5 pts for evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction, developmental and motor dysfunction, and neuropathological evidence.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6a762ef5-cdc0-41a6-9666-f7c73b76789d","type":"Finding","dc:description":"This mouse demonstrated evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction (reduced complex III activity and alterations of Complex III assembly).

A series of brain MRIs showed progression of necrotic lesions from an initial bilateral involvement of the caudate nuclei (at 18 years of age) to the present condition characterized by severe cerebellar atrophy with leukodystrophic abnormalities, bilateral  involvement of the inferior olives, substantia nigra, and periaqueductal grey of the mesencephalon, external segment of  the left putamen and both caudate nuclei. Although blood lactate was referred as normal, proton-specific mass spectroscopy (1H-MRS) showed a lactate peak in both putamina. Muscle histology and histochemistry, including reactions for COX and succinate dehydrogenase, were normal, but analysis of the MRC activities in muscle homogenate revealed the presence of an isolated, severe defect of cIII (19% of control)","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0011924","obo:HP_0002376"],"previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","secondTestingMethod":"Next generation sequencing panels","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7deb85b6-377a-4ce4-a7a6-6a16c6aec2fe_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21278747","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/10b033df-59d0-453e-9b68-4a1d8ccfef76"}}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":612,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria6","strengthScore":18,"subject":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/h1WHmgCE-mY","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0009723","gene":"hgnc:26006","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","websiteLegacyID":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/assertion_8dc9dcb6-1f63-41b1-80f1-a0f2a87b5ec4-","@context":{"@vocab":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"},"curationReasons":{"@type":"@vocab","@container":"@set"},"GCISnapshot":{"@type":"@id"},"dc:isVersionOf":{"@type":"@id"},"websiteLegacyID":{"@type":"@id"}}}
