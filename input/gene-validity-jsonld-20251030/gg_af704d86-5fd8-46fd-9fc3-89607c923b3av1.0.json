{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/af704d86-5fd8-46fd-9fc3-89607c923b3av1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"The PNPLA6 gene is located on chromosome 19 at 19p13.2 and encodes the patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein 6, which deacetylates intracellular phosphatidylcholine to produce glycerophosphocholine. PNPLA6 was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive retinal dystrophy-ataxia-pituitary hormone abnormalities-hypogonadism (RAPH) syndrome in 2014 (Synofzik et al., PMID: 24355708). The major features of this disorder include pituitary hormone abnormalities which involve growth hormone deficiency resulting in short stature, as well as hypothyroidism. Additional features reported in multiple patients include lower limb spasticity, distal muscle wasting, cerebellar atrophy, increased patellar reflexes, neuropathy, trichomegaly, alopecia, and mild cognitive impairment. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in molecular mechanism, inheritance pattern, and phenotypic variability in the following disease entities which ended up being lumped into one disease entity: Boucher-Neuhauser syndrome (OMIM:215470), Oliver-McFarlane syndrome (OMIM:275400), Laurence-Moon syndrome (OMIM:245800), and Gordon-Holmes syndrome (no OMIM entry, but Orphanet lists this as cerebellar ataxia hypogonadism syndrome (ORPHA:1173). The disorder listed in OMIM as spastic paraplegia 39, autosomal recessive (OMIM:612020) was split from the aforementioned lumped entity due to significant phenotypic variability and has been curated separately as PNPLA6-related spastic paraplegia with or without ataxia. Thirteen variants (eight missense, one essential splice site, three frameshift, and one tandem intragenic duplication of multiple exons) that have been reported in nine probands in three publications (Synofzik et al., 2014, PMID: 24355708; Topaloglu et al., 2014, PMID: 25033069; Hufnagel et el., 2015, PMID: 25480986) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is biallelic loss of function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by a zebrafish knockdown animal model which has fewer motor axons as well as increased defects in axon branching and truncation, a feature that correlates with axonal neuropathy seen in some patients (Song et al., 2013, PMID: 22996643). In addition, several variants seen in patients were unable to rescue the zebrafish morphant phenotype (PMID: 25480986). In summary, PNPLA6 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive RAPH syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Syndromic Disorders Gene Curation Expert Panel on the meeting date 11.02.2022 (SOP Version 9.0).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/af704d86-5fd8-46fd-9fc3-89607c923b3a","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bcc502f3-e49f-4549-ba75-782235974d21","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bcc502f3-e49f-4549-ba75-782235974d21_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10060","date":"2023-05-30T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bcc502f3-e49f-4549-ba75-782235974d21_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10060","date":"2023-05-30T20:37:12.735Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bcc502f3-e49f-4549-ba75-782235974d21_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bcc502f3-e49f-4549-ba75-782235974d21_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2e7d8ad4-3416-41a7-897d-6db6d9b68e2a","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Reduced score due to zebrafish morphants not showing several major features seen in patients.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/694aa116-016b-4776-80c1-bda1efdc323b","type":"Finding","dc:description":"The fewer motor neurons and a higher incidence of axon branching and truncation in the zebrafish morphants is similar to the motor neuropathy phenotype seen in some patients.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22996643","rdfs:label":"Zebrafish morpholino-mediated knockdown ","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bcc502f3-e49f-4549-ba75-782235974d21_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8cf5033d-2d9e-48be-a21e-cd74ab13963b_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7e5f44b6-3ef1-431d-98da-970514974273","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7e5f44b6-3ef1-431d-98da-970514974273_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25480986","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/eb10a75c-55ae-42d6-b859-75c5b9df1cfa","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001166114.2(PNPLA6):c.2149G>C (p.Gly717Arg)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA403124631"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":0.1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/efd789c6-ad6a-4c3d-87b8-5f6b4da97d9d","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/efd789c6-ad6a-4c3d-87b8-5f6b4da97d9d_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25480986","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/272acd19-5cee-4cb4-8152-2464a22dcb22","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001166114.2(PNPLA6):c.3058_3061dup (p.Arg1021GlnfsTer?)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA118372"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8cf5033d-2d9e-48be-a21e-cd74ab13963b","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25480986","rdfs:label":"F:2","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":42,"allele":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/eb10a75c-55ae-42d6-b859-75c5b9df1cfa"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/272acd19-5cee-4cb4-8152-2464a22dcb22"}],"ethnicity":{"id":"cg:UnknownEthnicity"},"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"42-years-old female with abnormal pituitary hormone concentrations including low gonadotropins.

He was noted to have a very small scrotum and penis. A standard GnRH stimulation test did not elicit any LH response. Furthermore, after a daily subcutaneous injection of GnRH at 0.1 mg for 1 week, plasma LH levels remained below the detection limit of 0.1 mIU/mL. One sibling was also affected.

Later evaluation demonstrated hypothyroidism and GH deficiency. Neurologic investigations revealed lack of coordination of the distal extremities, unsteady gait, and cerebellar and pyramidal signs, including absent deep reflexes and an extensor plantar reflex. Electromyography was consistent with peripheral neuropathy, and so the diagnosis of Laurence-Moon syndrome was also strongly considered. Brain computerized tomography (CT) scan at age 40 showed an empty sella, while the pituitary had appeared normal at 21 years of age.
