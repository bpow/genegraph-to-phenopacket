(PMID: 32298700). This is the only report of a patient with an APRIL deficiency caused by a homozygous *TNFSF13* null mutation (NM_003808.4:c.508del (p.Leu170CysfsTer5)) resulting in hypogammaglobulinemia with a markedly reduced level of plasmacytes in peripheral blood and a clearly increased level of circulating marginal zone B cells. This gene-disease relationship is supported by experimental evidence; the role of APRIL as a proliferation-inducing ligand which works in B cell maturation and maintenance (Yu G, et al., 2000, PMID: 10973284) through interaction with TACI (PMID: 10973284), and its enhanced expression in monocytes of healthy controls (PMID: 32298700) is consistent with the resulting CVID in the patient with absent expression. Functional alteration was also observed in patient B-cell and monocyte-derived dendritic cell coculture assays which mirrored clinical findings in patients (PMID: 32298700). The immunologic manifestations in the patient showed some overlap with APRIL-/- mice (PMID: 18180376), although additional APRIL-/- mice were reported to have no gross abnormalities, in the immune system or otherwise (PMID: 14729948, 14988498). In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1dd20089-9a47-418c-836d-3b3ad7092e7c","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c181d44b-5c48-441b-95ad-b4d06572596d","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c181d44b-5c48-441b-95ad-b4d06572596d_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10080","date":"2022-09-20T12:50:18.362Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c181d44b-5c48-441b-95ad-b4d06572596d_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10080","date":"2022-09-20T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"The curation scored intermediate of Limited and Moderate classifications and the genetic evidence from the single patient was not considered sufficient to justify the Moderate classification, as such a Limited classification has been applied.","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c181d44b-5c48-441b-95ad-b4d06572596d_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ee89a44e-0684-48a8-b305-54aa2d810e0e_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/11b944c7-2e7d-4aac-9cbb-2c6cb07eaf15","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The homozygous, due to consanguinity, NM_003808.4:c.508del (p.Leu170CysfsTer5) frameshift mutation leads to premature termination at Val174, predicted to cause NMD, consistent with the findings that APRIL mRNA and protein were completely absent in the monocytes and iPSC-moDCs of the patient.","calculatedScore":4,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/11b944c7-2e7d-4aac-9cbb-2c6cb07eaf15_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"Performed transient expression experiments.
