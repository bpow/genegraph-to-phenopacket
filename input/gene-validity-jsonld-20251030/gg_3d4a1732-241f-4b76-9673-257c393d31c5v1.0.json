However, only 2 (missense, large deletion) were scored as the other variants were too frequent in population databases. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss-of-function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence (expression-level evidence, interaction evidence; PMIDs: 7916676, 24069547). In a luciferase assay, the gene interacted with NKX2-5, which has been classified as definitive for congenital, conduction, and myopathic heart disease. Analysis in mouse embryos showed early expression of* CRIPTO* in the truncus arteriosus. In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the Congenital Heart Disease GCEP on 6/10/2024 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3d4a1732-241f-4b76-9673-257c393d31c5","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/15231240-2c6d-44c5-9623-05127bb30b6e","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/15231240-2c6d-44c5-9623-05127bb30b6e_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10130","date":"2024-08-21T12:34:47.393Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/15231240-2c6d-44c5-9623-05127bb30b6e_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10130","date":"2024-06-10T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"Please note that the score for genetic evidence should be 0.6, as there was a large deletion scored at 0.5 that the Gene Curation Interface would not allow me to enter.
