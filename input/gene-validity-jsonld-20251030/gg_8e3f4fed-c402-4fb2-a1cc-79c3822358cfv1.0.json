{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8e3f4fed-c402-4fb2-a1cc-79c3822358cfv1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"CPT1C was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant pure hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) in 2015 (Rinaldi C et al., PMID:25751282). Phenotypes include hyperreflexia, proximal muscle weakness, muscle atrophy, decreased vibration sensation at the ankles, and mild urinary dysfunction. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level, segregation, and experimental data. Three variants (missense, nonsense, and canonical splicing) reported in three probands in three publications (PMIDs: 25751282, 30911584, 30564185) are included in this curation. This gene-disease relationship is supported by the role of CPT1C as a protein involved in lipid droplet biogenesis and turnover, processes known to be impacted in HSP (PMID: 34041268). Additionally, a knockout (KO) mouse model demonstrated that KO mice presented early onset of progressive motor disturbances, including impaired gait and coordination, severe muscle weakness, and reduced locomotor activity that recapitulates the disease phenotype (Carrasco P et al., PMID: 23973755). Immunostaining in COS-7 cells expressing the R37C missense demonstrated a decrease in the number and size of lipid droplets per cell, similar to what is observed in neurons of Cpt1c−/− mice (Rinaldi C et al., PMID: 25751282).\n\nIn summary, limited evidence supports the gene-disease relationship between CPT1C and AD HSP. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged. The ClinGen Cerebral Palsy, Gene Curation Expert Panel, approved this classification on March 20, 2023 (SOP Version 9).\n\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8e3f4fed-c402-4fb2-a1cc-79c3822358cf","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8d171b54-3af1-442a-9c54-b959061a7b5a","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8d171b54-3af1-442a-9c54-b959061a7b5a_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10113","date":"2023-05-23T15:31:41.222Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8d171b54-3af1-442a-9c54-b959061a7b5a_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10113","date":"2023-03-20T18:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8d171b54-3af1-442a-9c54-b959061a7b5a_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8d171b54-3af1-442a-9c54-b959061a7b5a_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/073a58bc-1c57-4173-b4a2-ec76842d2673","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/da32ec47-bd37-4c7a-958d-57dd3881d976","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Cpt1c-deficient mice developed early onset of progressive motor disturbances, including impaired gait and coordination, severe muscle weakness, and reduced locomotor activity.
