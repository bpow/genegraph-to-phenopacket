{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7a6a65ba-5a34-49a2-a2e8-99742382b6b1v1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"Executive Summary TEKT1:\n\n**TEKT1, Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (MONDO:0016575), autosomal recessive**\n\nTEKT1 was first described in relation to PCD (MONDO:0016575), OMIM:603336) in 2018 (PMID: 29121203, Ryan et al. 2018). Currently, there are no published monogenic probands in the literature that display respiratory features characteristic of primary ciliary dyskinesia. Per the recommendations of the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, the GCEP decided to dispute the current assertions for the gene-diseases entities. This curation is focused on the relationship between TEKT1 and Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia.\n\nThe only asserted proband in the literature was a proband with two TEKT1 variants: NM_053285.2:c.730C>T (p.Arg244Ter) and NM_053285.2:c.933G>T (p.Lys311Asn). NM_053285.2:c.933G>T (p.Lys311Asn) was found to have high frequency in the East Asian population. However, the proband also carried two WDR19 variants: NM_025132.4:c.3533G>A (p.Arg1178Gln) and a large deletion of the 5’ region encompassing the 4 first exons of the gene (PMID: 29121203). The proband received a diagnosis of Mainzer-Saldino syndrome with PCD-like airway disease and Leber congenital amaurosis. The PCD-like airway disease was attributed to TEKT1 and the Mainzer-Saldino syndrome was attributed to WDR19. Phenotypes included: intellectual disability/intellectual disability associated with brain ventricle dilatation, cardiomegaly, recurrent infections, pneumothorax/lung collapse, respiratory tract infection/respiratory syncytial virus infections, immotile cilia, mispositioned ciliary basal bodies, misaligned cilia, cystic liver and pancreas, bone dysplasia with cone-shaped epiphyses, thoracic distension, kidney cysts and end-stage renal disease. However, there was a noted lack of sinusitis, otitis media and situs inversus. The proband was an only child of French (Caucasian; mother) and Japanese (father) origin.\n\nTwo variants: (2 types of genetic mutations: missense (1) and nonsense (1)) that have been reported in 1 proband in 1 publication (PMID: 29121203) are included in this curation. The proband included in this curation was not scored. \n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by multiple forms of experimental evidence such as expression A (Quantity: 1), model system: Zebrafish (Quantity: 1) and biochemical function B (Quantity: 1). First, GTEx data showed that TEKT1 is primarily expressed in fallopian tube, liver and testis. This evidence is recapitulated within ProteinAtlas where the gene was shown to be primarily expressed in female tissues, respiratory system, brain and male tissues, which is consistent with PCD phenotypes (PMID: 23715323). Ryan et al. 2018 (PMID: 29121203) included a Zebrafish model where the model recapitulated the abnormal ciliary motility found in the human proband. The model also had additional phenotypes typically associated with PCD that were not found in the human probands: very mild body curvature (scoliosis), heart looping (laterality defects), and tekt1 morphants which presented incorrect formation and positioning of the otoliths in the otic vesicle which requires motile cilia function. 54% of the tekt1 morphants presented fused, misshapen or supernumerary otoliths (affected ciliary morphology and motility). Next, Gui el al. 2022 showed the localization of TEKT1 within human respiratory doublet microtubules, which are a part of the microtubule inner protein family (MIPs). Lastly, human patients with PCD caused by defects in CCDC39 or CCDC40 show ciliary structural defects that include reduced signal from tektins (Walton et al, 2023, PMID: 37258679).\n\nIn conclusion, TEKT1 has a disputed association with Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia. While the published experimental evidence demonstrates phenotypes that are consistent with a PCD diagnosis, it is currently unclear how the disease expression translates to a monogenic disease presentation within human probands.\n\nThis classification was approved by the Motile Ciliopathy GCEP on March 13th, 2025 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7a6a65ba-5a34-49a2-a2e8-99742382b6b1","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0667db63-0608-44d0-b65b-21fbe48d984e","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"NoKnownDiseaseRelationship","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0667db63-0608-44d0-b65b-21fbe48d984e_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10102","date":"2025-06-20T20:35:58.737Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0667db63-0608-44d0-b65b-21fbe48d984e_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10102","date":"2025-03-13T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"At this time, the only TEKT1 variant containing individual present in the literature has limited to no features of PCD.

She presents intellectual disability associated with brain ventricle dilatation (Fig. 1C) as well as cardiomegaly (Fig. 1D). The proband's ethnicity: French (Caucasian; mother) and Japanese (father) origin.\n\nDuring her first year of life, the affected individual had recurrent airway infections with lung collapse, together with respiratory syncytial virus infections, and presented diffuse interstitial infiltrate in both pulmonary fields (Fig. 1B and D). Ciliary motility was first visually evaluated by optical microscopy on cells obtained from nasal brushing which led to the diagnosis of rarefaction of cilia and ciliary dyskinesia (4 months). A second analysis was done at 5 years of age by high-speed videomicroscopy, showing that cilia were sparse (see also below) and displayed aberrant beating patterns (slow or immotile) and heterogenous and non-synchronized movements (Supplementary Material, Video S1). Different populations of cilia were identified: 75% were immotile and 25% displayed dyskinetic movements with reduced amplitude and a very low ciliary beat frequency (4.7 Hertz) compared with control (Supplementary Material, Video S2). Such defects in cilia motility are frequently observed in PCD. However, despite the clinical evidence suggestive of PCD (brain ventricle dilations and ciliary dyskinesia with concomitant airway infections), the affected individual did not present sinusitis, media otitis nor situs inversus frequently observed in PCD (45). PCD is also characterized by lower levels of nasal nitric oxide, however, it was not possible to do such measurements in the NPH1848 individual due to her general health state.\n\nIn conclusion, the affected individual presented with both MZSDS and PCD-like airway disease. These manifestations are evocative of both primary and motile ciliary defects, and present an association of manifestations not described previously.","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001249","obo:HP_0002107","obo:HP_0012262","obo:HP_0001640","obo:HP_0012263","obo:HP_0011947","obo:HP_0002719","obo:HP_0012265"],"sex":"Female","variant":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d33e2bbc-8c3c-44af-90b8-2173570c4271_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ec6e2a40-2499-46e3-b43b-57f191356267_variant_evidence_item"}]}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria","strengthScore":0}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0}],"evidenceStrength":"Disputed","sequence":10645,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria11","strengthScore":2,"subject":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/kOcRRVPWF88","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0016575","gene":"hgnc:15534","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","websiteLegacyID":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/assertion_0667db63-0608-44d0-b65b-21fbe48d984e-","@context":{"@vocab":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"},"curationReasons":{"@type":"@vocab","@container":"@set"},"GCISnapshot":{"@type":"@id"},"dc:isVersionOf":{"@type":"@id"},"websiteLegacyID":{"@type":"@id"}}}
