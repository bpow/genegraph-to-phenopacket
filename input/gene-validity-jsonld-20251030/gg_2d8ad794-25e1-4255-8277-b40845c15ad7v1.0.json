When flagellin is detected, NF-kappaB is mobilized, which then activates inflammation-related factors (Hayashi et al., PMID: 11323673).  *TLR5* was first reported in relation to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in 2005 (Hawn et al., PMID: 16027372). \n \nGenetic evidence reviewed during the curation of this gene-disease relationship included one proband who also carried a *de novo* gain of function *PIK3CD* variant in addition to the TLR5 p.Tyr108His variant (Hou et al., PMID: 36810668). A patient with a non-SLE-related phenotype carried a maternally inherited microdeletion that included parts of *TLR5* (Jun et al., PMID: 23542665). Linkage studies originally identified an association between the 1q41-1q42 region (which includes *TLR5*) and susceptibility to SLE. A case-control study (Hawn et al., PMID: 16027372) found a protective association between the common stop codon polymorphism c.1147C>T in *TLR5* and risk of developing SLE. There have since been four additional case-control studies in 2007, 2009, 2015, and 2017 that have found no significant associations between healthy controls and patients with SLE for this variant (PMIDs: 17516623, 19473567, 26221343, 28763101).\n\nExperimental evidence is limited to the common c.1174C>T variant. In isolated blood cells, impaired cytokine production in response to flagellin was found in c.1174C>T heterozygotes compared to controls. The authors hypothesized that the c.1174C>T variant provides protection from developing SLE by decreasing the production of proinflammatory cytokines (Hawn et al., PMID: 16027372). One study found increased expression of *TLR5* in the kidneys of lupus nephritis patients both at the protein and mRNA levels (Elloumi et al., PMID: 28763101).\n\nIn summary, there is **limited** evidence to support the relationship between *TLR5* and systemic lupus erythematosus. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Monogenic Systemic and Incomplete Lupus Erythematosus GCEP on the meeting date February 12, 2025 (SOP Version 11).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2d8ad794-25e1-4255-8277-b40845c15ad7","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/19220ed6-6724-43bc-9915-9de277183429","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/19220ed6-6724-43bc-9915-9de277183429_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10123","date":"2025-03-18T02:14:10.499Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/19220ed6-6724-43bc-9915-9de277183429_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10123","date":"2025-02-12T20:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/19220ed6-6724-43bc-9915-9de277183429_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/19220ed6-6724-43bc-9915-9de277183429_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d4270a76-61ff-4b2c-93d7-6305f7c663be","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/181d7390-c0be-4ac6-ab51-8122f84f06a9","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Isolated peripheral mononuclear cells from WT homozygotes and heterozygotes were stimulated with purified flagellin for 18 hours.
