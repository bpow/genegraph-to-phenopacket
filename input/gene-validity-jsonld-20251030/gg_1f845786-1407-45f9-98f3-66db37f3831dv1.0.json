Four unrelated individuals were reported with biallelic *CFAP298* truncating variants and a classical PCD phenotype with reduced nasal nitric oxide, recurrent chest infections and both outer and inner dynein arm defects. Situs inversus was detected in all 3 patients carrying the homozygous c.735C>G (p.Tyr245Ter) nonsense variant. Haplotype analysis of these patients indicated that this mutation is located within a shared haplotype and strongly suggested a founder effect, consistent with the high allele frequency of 0.001736 observed in among control individuals in the Ashkenazi Jewish population. The fourth published patient was compound heterozygous for the truncating variants c.292C>T (p.Arg98Ter), and c.792_795delTTTA (p.Tyr264Ter). Injection of human C21orf59 mRNA bearing the c.792_795delTTTA (p.Tyr264Ter) mutation failed to rescue cilia motility in zebrafish (PMID: 24094744). This curation identified but did not score an additional published proband from a cohort with laterality defects, due to the absence of additional clinical details to evaluate the full phenotype (PMID: 34215651). This curation was also informed by the identification of an additional proband within a French PCD cohort with biallelic variants in *CFAP298* and a phenotype matching the published cases. The mechanism of disease appears to be biallelic loss-of-function in *CFAP298*, however, there is an urgent need for publication of additional cases to better understand the spectrum of disease-causing variants and clinical features.\n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence that the *C21orf59* transcript is strongly expressed in ciliated tissues of the zebrafish trunk, including the pronephric ducts and spinal canal (PMID: 24094744). Morpholino knockdown of the *C21orf59* gene in zebrafish resulted in loss of dynein arms and a strong ciliopathy phenotype, including those involving pronephric cysts, axis curvature, left-right asymmetry defects, and hydrocephalus. Moreover, *C21orf59* mRNA expression in ciliated tissues is eliminated by *Foxj1a* knockdown, indicating that *C21orf59* expression is controlled by this ciliogenic transcription factor. *C21orf59*/*Kurly* (*Kur*) was also required for proper cilia polarization needed for the movement of the ECF in the zebrafish kidney and the larval skin of *Xenopus laevis* (PMID: 26904945). Motility- impaired *Chlamydomonas* mutants showed increased abundance of C21orf59/FBB18 protein suggesting that it is induced or stabilized when cilia motility is impaired (PMID: 24094744).\n \nIn summary, there is moderate evidence to support the gene-disease relationship of *CFAP298* with primary ciliary dyskinesia 26 (MONDO:0014211). While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship more definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Motile Ciliopathy GCEP on August 10th, 2023 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1f845786-1407-45f9-98f3-66db37f3831d","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f29143ae-869e-4e4c-8464-8c61f2c2663c","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f29143ae-869e-4e4c-8464-8c61f2c2663c_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10102","date":"2023-08-09T18:55:32.554Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f29143ae-869e-4e4c-8464-8c61f2c2663c_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10102","date":"2023-08-10T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f29143ae-869e-4e4c-8464-8c61f2c2663c_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/65faab30-39b1-46e5-bf65-50e010b9c84b_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b530f30d-3157-4c99-9fb0-93af2de983c2","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"only 19 PCD genes were screened","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b530f30d-3157-4c99-9fb0-93af2de983c2_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"Coinjection of c21orf59 morpholino \nwith a full-length human C21orf59 mRNA\n or three C21orf59 missense alleles \nrescued the motility of KV cilia, whereas \ninjection of human C21orf59 mRNA \nbearing the c.792_795delTTTA \n(p.Tyr264∗) mutation failed to \nrescue cilia motility.\n","functionalDataSupport":"Yes"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b530f30d-3157-4c99-9fb0-93af2de983c2_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24094744","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/34029325-ca4a-4b1f-a9ac-4386686e2bdf","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_021254.4(CFAP298):c.792_795del (p.Tyr264Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA021259"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e8501023-5a79-48f8-bb22-6786fff8b5b7","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"only 19 PCD genes were screened","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e8501023-5a79-48f8-bb22-6786fff8b5b7_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"yes","functionalDataSupport":"Yes"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e8501023-5a79-48f8-bb22-6786fff8b5b7_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24094744","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/10c4ec00-cb31-4e3e-a4e5-184c0f08ef34","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_021254.4(CFAP298):c.292C>T (p.Arg98Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA021253"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/65faab30-39b1-46e5-bf65-50e010b9c84b","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24094744","rdfs:label":"Austin_P2","allele":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/10c4ec00-cb31-4e3e-a4e5-184c0f08ef34"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/34029325-ca4a-4b1f-a9ac-4386686e2bdf"}],"firstTestingMethod":"Next generation sequencing panels","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Female","variant":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e8501023-5a79-48f8-bb22-6786fff8b5b7_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b530f30d-3157-4c99-9fb0-93af2de983c2_variant_evidence_item"}]}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2e17206f-6dea-4427-bf6f-28afeef288aa_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0b573e17-ce4f-4b00-8969-5dfe2fd68af0","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The variant is not predicted to trigger nonsense-mediated decay, but rather to C-terminally truncate the protein product by 15-16%.
