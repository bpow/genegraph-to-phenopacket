At least 2 unique variants (one nonsense and one frameshift) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 2 probands in 2 publications (PMIDs: 25516138, 25876182). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 6 additional family members. This gene-disease relationship is supported by its restricted expression in hematopoietic cells, its biochemical function as an adaptor protein involved in integrin activation, the functional alteration observed in patient and non-patient cells, and both conventional and conditional knockout mouse models. In summary, there is moderate evidence to support the relationship between *FYB1* and autosomal recessive thrombocytopenia 3. Additional reports in humans are needed to reach a definitive classification.\n\nThis gene-disease pair was previously evaluated by the HT GCEP on December 15, 2021. It was reevaluated on February 5th, 2024. As a result of this reevaluation no new evidence was identified and the classification remained Moderate (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/632da561-fe66-4b65-adb4-8dad18b3ea26","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0e4e83fb-516b-43f8-a0af-687b9d938f74","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Strong","changes":[{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"},{"id":"cg:sopChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0e4e83fb-516b-43f8-a0af-687b9d938f74_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2024-02-05T14:05:29.361Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0e4e83fb-516b-43f8-a0af-687b9d938f74_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2024-02-05T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"Despite a score of 12 points reaching the Strong level, there are currently only 2 reported unrelated probands harboring variants, which the Hemostasis Thrombosis GCEP considered insufficient genetic evidence for a Strong/Definitive classification so the Clinical Validity Classification was modified to Moderate.","curationReasons":["RecurationTiming"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0e4e83fb-516b-43f8-a0af-687b9d938f74_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0e4e83fb-516b-43f8-a0af-687b9d938f74_seg_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/10a35076-ce3c-49a2-8e21-af61b83a15d3_proband_segregation","type":"FamilyCosegregation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25516138","rdfs:label":"Hamamy Family","estimatedLodScore":1.83,"family":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/10a35076-ce3c-49a2-8e21-af61b83a15d3","type":"Family","rdfs:label":"Hamamy Family","member":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/65874cb2-58c2-4379-bdc5-ad0e7f9d46e1","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25516138","rdfs:label":"IV:5","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":18,"allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/518b8d76-60d7-447a-afe7-4f981bde6d67","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001465.6(FYB1):c.1385_1386del (p.Tyr462Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/417970"}},"detectionMethod":"Proband IV:5 had exome sequencing which identified the variant of interest in FYB, verified by sanger sequencing in this proband and additional family members.","firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"Platelet count of 40 × 10^9/L and mean platelet volume of 6.0 fL [Normal range is 7.0-11.0 fL]","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001873","obo:HP_0005537","obo:HP_0000967"],"previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"CAMT was excluded when no pathogenic variant was identified by exome sequencing.
