HGSNAT encodes acetyl–CoA:α-glucosaminide N-acetyltransferase, a lysosomal membrane enzyme that is involved in the degradation of the glycosaminoglycan heparan sulfate via acetylating the nonreducing, terminal alpha-glucosamine residue of intralysosomal heparin and heparan sulfate, converting it into a substrate for alpha-N-acetylglucosaminidase (PMID: 16960811). Among patients with MPS3C, deficient acetyl–CoA:α-glucosaminide N-acetyltransferase activity (PMID: 33384) results in lysosomal accumulation of heparan sulfate, leading to progressive neurological disease whose features include developmental delay, behavioral problems and mental deterioration, and motor dysfunction, with variable extra-neurological manifestations (as reviewed in PMID: 18392742). \n\nLumping and splitting: Based on detailed discussion between the Lysosomal Diseases and Retina GCEPs, expert opinion concluded that the two disorders noted in OMIM, i.e. Mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIC (Sanfilippo C) (MIM# 252930) and Retinitis pigmentosa 73 (MIM# 616544), should remain split for the purposes of gene curation. While retinopathy can be one of the features observed in individuals with MPS IIIC, those individuals have involvement of mutiple organ systems. At the time of precuration, the reported individuals with Retinitis pigmentosa 73 have isolated retinopathy without extra-ocular features (except for one patient with mild hearing loss) (e.g. PMID: 25859010, 32347150, 32770643). When measured, N-acetyltransferase activity was usually reduced in patients with isolated retinopathy, but less so than in patients with MPS IIIC. There are no reports of identical genotypes causing isolated retinopathy and MPS IIIC.  Biallelic null genotypes are seen in some MPS IIIC families but never in those with late-onset retinal disease (PMID: 32770643). In summary, isolated retinopathy was not felt to represent an attenuated form of MPS IIIC. As such, the two disease entities will remain split. However, it is recommended that patients with retinopathy and variants in HGSNAT be evaluated for other features of MPS IIIC.\n\nThe disease mechanism of MPS3C is loss of function. MPS3C was first reported by Kresse et al. in 1976 (Kresse H, Von Figura K, Bartsocas C. 1976. Clinical and biochemical findings in a family with Sanfilippo disease, type C. (Abstract) Clin Genet 10:364.) and the first report of biallelic variants in HGNSAT among MPS type IIIC patients was by Fan et al. in 2006 (PMID: 16960811). Both case-level (genetic) and experimental evidence support the relationship between HGSNAT and MPS3C. Reported causal variants include missense, nonsense, frameshift, and splice-altering variants (PMID: 19479962, PMID: 16960811, PMID: 17033958, PMID: 18518886, PMID: 20825431). In total, nine variants from five probands in four publications were curated. Although there is additional published case-level evidence available, the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has already been reached. \n\nExperimental evidence for the relationship between HGSNAT and MPS3C includes: the biochemical function of the gene product (acetyl–CoA:α-glucosaminide N-acetyltransferase) being consistent with the clinical and biochemical findings identified individuals with MPS3C (PMID: 16960811, PMID: 18392742); the biochemical and clinical features of HGSNAT knockout mice (PMID: 25567323); and rescue of neurologic impairment and HGSNAT enzymatic activity via recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated gene therapy in HGSNAT knockout mice (PMID: 29788236). Additional experimental evidence is available, but the maximum score for experimental evidence (6 points) has already been reached.\n\nIn sum, HGSNAT is definitively associated with MPS3C. The association has been repeatedly demonstrated in both clinical and research settings, and has been upheld over time. Classification approved by the ClinGen Lysosomal Diseases Variant Curation Expert Panel, December 4, 2023 (SOP v9).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e5eeeacb-ec05-4173-823a-95e928d81d01","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/943b7a75-eb7f-415b-ba80-de6b09cc5a43","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/943b7a75-eb7f-415b-ba80-de6b09cc5a43_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10110","date":"2023-12-15T22:11:20.414Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/943b7a75-eb7f-415b-ba80-de6b09cc5a43_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10110","date":"2023-12-04T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/943b7a75-eb7f-415b-ba80-de6b09cc5a43_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/943b7a75-eb7f-415b-ba80-de6b09cc5a43_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/54320523-f877-43e8-a2b6-6fa9a415d7da","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a3110ed1-3c0b-4504-8750-be49cf9c5cdc","type":"Finding","dc:description":"HGSNAT
