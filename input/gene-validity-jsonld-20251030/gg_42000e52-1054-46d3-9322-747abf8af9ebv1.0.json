Microcephaly with lissencephaly and/or hydranencephaly is a brain disorder that is characterized by extreme microcephaly (typically head circumference of less than 10 standard deviations (SD) below the mean), profound motor and intellectual disability, spasticity, and incomplete cerebral formation. Patients demonstrate cortical dysgenesis ranging from simplification to pachygyria/lissencephaly to hydranencephaly. Agenesis of the corpus callosum as well as hypoplasia of the brainstem and cerebellum are typically present. These presentations were lumped into a single disease curation, consistent with shared molecular mechanism and mode of inheritance (Autosomal Recessive, AR). \n\nAt least 8 variants in *NDE1* have been identified in individuals with microcephaly with lissencephaly and/or hydranencephaly over 14 years (PMID: 21529751, 34562061,21529752, 22526350, 30637988, 29191162, 23704059). These variants include loss of function and missense variants in highly conserved residues. In the literature, patients with severe microcephaly have been identified with deletions of 16p13.11 (including *NDE1*) and an additional *NDE1* variant on the second allele (PMID: 23704059, PMID: 29191162). Due to the prominent phenotype, these cases have been scored. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum genetic evidence (12 pts) was reached. \n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by animal models and in vitro data. *NDE1* was first associated with cerebral cortical size in 2004 (PMID: 15473967). Initially, *NDE1* was identified as a *LIS1* interacting protein (PMID: 11163258). *NDE1* is part of a multiprotein complex that regulates dynein function, playing an essential role in microtubule organization, mitosis and neuronal migration. Experimental data from mouse and yeast studies supports the role of *NDE1* in brain malformation. *NDE1* is strongly expressed in the developing mouse cerebral cortex (PMID: 11163258). Null mouse models of *NDE1* demonstrate neuronal migration defects, resulting in microcephaly, including fewer neurons and a thin superficial cortical layer (PMID: 15473967). \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *NDE1* and microcephaly with lissencephaly and/or hydranencephaly. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.This classification was approved by the ClinGen Brain Malformation GCEP on December 10, 2024 (SOP 11). \n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/42000e52-1054-46d3-9322-747abf8af9eb","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1661eceb-99dd-41d1-9253-6378595732cb","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1661eceb-99dd-41d1-9253-6378595732cb_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10020","date":"2025-06-30T22:32:46.986Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1661eceb-99dd-41d1-9253-6378595732cb_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10020","date":"2024-12-10T18:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1661eceb-99dd-41d1-9253-6378595732cb_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1661eceb-99dd-41d1-9253-6378595732cb_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/262bd6c2-ca25-43de-976f-7b0ec9dd3bf7","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/45ec4ae4-8c64-4fc0-88ca-aa6e14819d27","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Both mouse and humans demosntrate microcephaly.

We identified two missense mutations in PRC1 (MIM 603484) and RRN3 (MIM 605121) and one homozygous splice-site mutation in NDE1; no coding insertion or deletion mutations were observed (data not shown). We prioritized the NDE1 variant because the other two were missense variants affecting residues that are not well conserved in orthologous proteins. Although the missense variant in PRC1 is observed in hedgehogs, the variant in RRN3 is present in cows, horses, and medaka ","firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0004322","obo:HP_0002120","obo:HP_0001274","obo:HP_0000252","obo:HP_0001511","obo:HP_0001272"],"previousTesting":false,"sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3aafdb35-77a0-4e0e-96d2-0c620a112a51_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21529752","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cf46b5ca-c2e3-4724-b5e9-a0f3eff1c9f9"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"}}}},"phenotypeNegativeAlleleNegative":1,"phenotypePositiveAllelePositive":1,"phenotypes":["obo:HP_0002120","obo:HP_0000252","obo:HP_0001272","obo:HP_0004322","obo:HP_0001511","obo:HP_0001274"],"proband":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6d45e5ac-30e3-429a-b742-cb0a101ee09a"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValiditySegregationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1f6b2251-dd8d-413d-8304-405c46e60d6a_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/008659dc-9f62-4edd-949b-b5f386da64a1","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":3.0,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/008659dc-9f62-4edd-949b-b5f386da64a1_variant_evidence_item"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":3.0},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1f6b2251-dd8d-413d-8304-405c46e60d6a"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria","strengthScore":3.0},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/68647e5a-dc2e-4fbe-93d8-73b7db860806_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e49ace84-a5ea-45c1-9535-7482630142bc","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":4,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e49ace84-a5ea-45c1-9535-7482630142bc_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"Mutant failed to localize to centrosome.
