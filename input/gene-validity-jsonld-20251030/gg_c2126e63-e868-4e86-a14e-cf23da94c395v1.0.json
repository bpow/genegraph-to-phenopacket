The features of *PARN*-related short telomere syndrome are variable, but can include oral leukoplakia, nail dystrophy, abnormal skin pigmentation, premature graying of the hair, cerebellar hypoplasia, bone marrow failure, pulmonary fibrosis, and short telomere length (PMIDs: 25893599, 25848748). Pulmonary phenotypes have been seen both in isolation and as part of a syndromic presentation (PMID: 34479523). In addition to a variable phenotype, there is also incomplete penetrance of pulmonary fibrosis in individuals who have monoallelic *PARN* variants (PMID: 25848748). Typically, pediatric presentation is often in the context of the Hoyerall-Hreidarsson syndrome or dyskeratosis congenita, whereas pulmonary fibrosis is the most common manifestation in adulthood. \n\nPer criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in molecular mechanism or phenotypic variability. Therefore, the following disease entities have been lumped into one disease entity: dyskeratosis congenita, autosomal recessive 6 (OMIM: 616353), pulmonary fibrosis and/or bone marrow failure syndrome, telomere-related, 4 (OMIM: 616371), Hoyeraal-Hreidarsson syndrome (ORPHA:3322).\nThirteen variants (4 missense, 3 frameshift, 3 canonical splice-site, 2 nonsense, 1 intronic deletion) that have been reported in 11 probands across 4 publications (PMIDs: 30525901, 25893599, 25848748, 31448843) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is reported to be loss of function that results in shortened telomeres.\n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence including biochemical function data showing a shared function with other genes that cause short telomere syndromes (PMIDs: 26482878, 20301779, 20301408). In addition, functional alteration assays in non-patient cells exhibiting reduced deadenylation of telomerase RNA and subsequent decrease in telomerase activity (PMIDs: 31273937, 25893599), a cell culture model showing reduced *PARN* protein level and shortened telomeres (PMID: 31448843), and a knockdown zebrafish model system that has a hematological phenotype similar to the human bone marrow phenotype, which is rescued by injection of human *PARN* mRNA (PMID: 26342108).\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *PARN* and semidominant *PARN*-related short telomere syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Interstitial Lung Disease GCEP on the meeting date October 25, 2024 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c2126e63-e868-4e86-a14e-cf23da94c395","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/41fad60d-6ec1-4888-9072-f5135b68aad6","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/41fad60d-6ec1-4888-9072-f5135b68aad6_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10138","date":"2024-11-26T15:46:49.983Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/41fad60d-6ec1-4888-9072-f5135b68aad6_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10138","date":"2024-10-25T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/41fad60d-6ec1-4888-9072-f5135b68aad6_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f37a18e5-4c76-468c-96a6-75a77340f2f2_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0c5346cc-4337-4d04-a0ee-7a0cfd7210bd","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"This canonical splice-site variant, c.1081+1G>A in intron 16, is absent from gnomAD v4.1.0.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0c5346cc-4337-4d04-a0ee-7a0cfd7210bd_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"Immunoblot analysis of PARN from LCLs derived from control subjects and from different individuals with the indicated heterozygous PARN mutation showed that PARN protein expression was significantly (P < 0.05) reduced compared to controls.","functionalDataSupport":"Yes"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0c5346cc-4337-4d04-a0ee-7a0cfd7210bd_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25848748","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/34d9b6c5-4765-4c6e-ad08-a09a331d260e","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_002582.4(PARN):c.1081+1G>A","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA394802667"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:MonoallelicHeterozygous"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f37a18e5-4c76-468c-96a6-75a77340f2f2","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25848748","rdfs:label":"Stuart Family F436 Proband III.2","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":71,"allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/34d9b6c5-4765-4c6e-ad08-a09a331d260e"},"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"27 pack-year smoking history.
