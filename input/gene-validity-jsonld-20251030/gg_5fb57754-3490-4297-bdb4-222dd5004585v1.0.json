{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5fb57754-3490-4297-bdb4-222dd5004585v1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"Optineurin was first identified as a binding partner of an adenoviral E3-14.7K protein and named as “FIP2“ (14.7-interacting protein) (Li et al. 1998, PMID: 9488477). Because optineurin has a strong homology to NF-kappa-B essential molecule (NEMO), it was also named as NRP (NEMO-related protein (Schwamborn et al.  2000, PMID:10807909). Through linkage study of a large family with a classical form of normal-tension open angle glaucoma, an adullt-onset POAG locus (GLC1E) was mapped to 10p15-p14 region (Sarfarazi et al. 1998, PMID: 9497264). Subsequently based on its physical location and its expression in retina, a candidate gene was identified and a heterozygous missense mutation [Glu50 > Lys (E50K)] was detected in the original GLC1E family and proved to be a recurrent mutation associated with hereditary primary open-angle glaucoma with normal intraocular pressure (OMIM:602432, Rezaie et al. 2002, PMID: 11834836). It was desigated as the *OPTN* (for optineurin, “optic neuropathy inducing” protein) (PMID: 11834836). \n\n*OPTN* variants have been identified in patients with glaucoma and patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) with or without frontotemporal dementia. It appears that different  types of *OPTN* variants are associated with specific diseases. The *OPTN* p.Glu50Lys variant, for example, has only been identified in patients with normal tension glaucoma (PMID: 11834836, 16988596, 12920093, 17293779, 14597044), while an ALS associated variant *OPTN* c.166+349_370-945del (aka *OPTN*, EX5DEL) has only been found in patients with ALS and not in patients with glaucoma. The *OPTN* c.381_382insAG variant is an exception in that it was detected in patients with glaucoma (PMID: 11834836, 17293779) and in patients with ALS (PMID: 21220178, 26740678). However, this variant is common in some populations, suggesting it is a founder mutation. There is limited functional evidence to support its association to glaucoma.\n\nOver 10 *OPTN* variants have been reported in patients with glaucoma. However, only the p.Glu50Lys (E50K) variant showed evidence, including genetic and experimental  evidences, as a recurrent pathogenic variant associated with normal tension glaucoma with autosomal dominant inheritance.\n\nPer criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping & Splitting Working Group, the mode of inheritance and molecular mechanism were found to be distinct between patients with normal tension glaucoma (monoallelic disruption of *OPTN*  function) and ALS (biallelic loss of *OPTN* function). The lack of phenotypic overlap between the two diagnoses provided further support to curate normal tension glaucoma cases caused by *OPTN* variants as a separate disease entity, referred to as *OPTN*-related normal tension glaucoma.\n\nIn summary, *OPTN* is definitively associated with normal tension glaucoma. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both research and diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time without the emergence of contradictory evidence, leading to a Definitive classification. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Glaucoma and Neuro-Ophthalmology Gene Curation Expert Panel on November 17th, 2022 (SOP Version 9).\n\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5fb57754-3490-4297-bdb4-222dd5004585","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/22efb828-c989-4584-97f9-e1d795b7468f","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/22efb828-c989-4584-97f9-e1d795b7468f_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10077","date":"2022-12-21T18:12:35.115Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/22efb828-c989-4584-97f9-e1d795b7468f_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10077","date":"2022-11-17T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/22efb828-c989-4584-97f9-e1d795b7468f_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d3718aff-d83b-4afa-a0de-c88629dbabb1","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"This large POAG family (POAG-90) was included in the original linkage study (PMID: 9497264) and, through it, an adult-onset POAG locus (GLCIE) was mapped to 10p14-p15.
