(2011). Multiple case level studies have been performed with patients that have variants in the BAP1 gene. \nImmunohistochemistry on mesotheliomas from multiple families revealed lack of BAP1 nuclear expression. BAP1+/− mice develop more malignant mesotheliomas and spontaneous tumor development was found in three different mouse models with germline heterozygous mutations in Bap1, including two models in which the knock-in mutations are identical to those reported in human BAP1 cancer syndrome families. Re-expression of BAP1 in BAP1-deficient mesothelioma cells markedly decreased colony-forming ability. All of these types of evidence are consistent with a definitive relationship between the BAP1 gene and BAP1-related tumor predisposition syndrome.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5c75e040-c7fa-4415-8c95-d7a19978e86a","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d70c33af-2e4f-4489-9c29-797655015b1d","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d70c33af-2e4f-4489-9c29-797655015b1d_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10023","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d70c33af-2e4f-4489-9c29-797655015b1d_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10023","date":"2019-03-21T17:57:13.803Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d70c33af-2e4f-4489-9c29-797655015b1d_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d70c33af-2e4f-4489-9c29-797655015b1d_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/825faf76-f9a5-4654-ae48-81ff032a36d1","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Minimal exposure to carcinogenic fibers may significantly increase the risk of malignant mesothelioma in genetically predisposed individuals carrying germline BAP1 mutations, possibly via alterations of the inflammatory response.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ca67ad19-aad4-4efe-ab50-2aa05605e1e0","type":"Finding","dc:description":"BAP1+/− mice exposed to low-dose asbestos fibers showed significant alterations of the peritoneal inflammatory response, including significantly higher levels of pro-tumorigenic alternatively polarized M2 macrophages, and lower levels of several chemokines and cytokines.
