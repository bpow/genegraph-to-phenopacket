The clinical presentation may be variable, but all reported probands to date have had elevated serum C27 bile acid intermediates, consistent with loss of *ACOX2* enzyme activity. Three variants (missense, nonsense, frameshift) that have been reported in six probands in three publications (PMID: 27647924, 27884763, 35395098) are included in this publication. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss of function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by in vitro functional assays, biochemical function, and an animal model (PMID: 8387517, 8943006, 29287774, 33736801, 31533369, 33340570, 35395098). Based on the available genetic and experimental evidence, the association between *ACOX2* and autosomal recessive congenital bile acid synthesis defect 6 has been classified as Definitive. This assertion has been upheld over time, and no contradictory evidence has yet emerged. This gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the ClinGen Inborn Errors of Metabolism GCEP on December 10, 2021. It was reevaluated on July 12, 2024 (SOP 10). As a result of this reevaluation, the classification was increased from Moderate to Definitive with the addition of new cases and experimental evidence, including a new mouse model.
