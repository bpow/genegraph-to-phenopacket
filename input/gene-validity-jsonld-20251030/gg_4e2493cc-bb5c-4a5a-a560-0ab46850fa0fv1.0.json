This association was made using case-level data. At least 8 missense variants and 1 deletion have been reported in humans. MYO7A was first associated with this disease in humans as early as 1997 (Liu et al.​). Association is seen in at least 11 probands in 10 publications (9354784, 15300860, 15121790, 15221449, 16449806, 21150918, 23451214, 23383098, 28802369, 29400105). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in >50 additional family members. This gene-disease association is supported by a heterozygous mouse model, a protein interaction study and a biochemical function study. Of note, this gene has also been implicated in Usher syndrome. This has been​ assessed separately. In summary, MYO7A is definitively associated with autosomal dominant nonsyndromic hearing loss. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hearing Loss Working Group on 3/19/18.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4e2493cc-bb5c-4a5a-a560-0ab46850fa0f","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/598b33f0-cdad-4290-b6eb-f9c2304c7bb6","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/598b33f0-cdad-4290-b6eb-f9c2304c7bb6_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2018-03-19T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/598b33f0-cdad-4290-b6eb-f9c2304c7bb6_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/598b33f0-cdad-4290-b6eb-f9c2304c7bb6_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/598b33f0-cdad-4290-b6eb-f9c2304c7bb6_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f166671c-98e6-44c2-9d47-47334e4514a4","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Phenotype characterized thoroughly, and supports pathogenicity of heterozygous MYO7A p.I178F variant","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9b803cbe-f2e6-47fa-a333-6a54cc6f21ee","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Heterozygous Hdb/+ mice had head bobbing and hyperactivity, and were found to have p.Ile178Phe mutation in MYO7A.

Wildtype IQ5 reduced Ca2+/Calmodulin-dependent vasocinstrictions because it competed with endogenous myosin kinase for calmodulin.
