At least 20 unique variants (in the 5’UTR) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 18 probands in 7 publications (PMIDs: 26175287, 23677566, 30747248, 28109976, 24030261, 21467542, 21211618). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 38 additional family members. The mechanism of disease is proposed to be gain of function, not haploinsufficiency (PMIDs: 21211618, 24430186). This gene-disease relationship is supported by altered expression and function in patient cells during megakaryopoeisis and proplatelet formation, as well as the rescue of proplatelet formation in patient cells by shRNA knockdown (PMID 24430186). In summary ANKRD26 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant thrombocytopenia 2. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/dd11093f-6d59-4f3f-99f9-eda43ab879dc","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e86bee2b-8353-48c2-8ea3-a6b2b26cdb2f","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e86bee2b-8353-48c2-8ea3-a6b2b26cdb2f_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e86bee2b-8353-48c2-8ea3-a6b2b26cdb2f_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2019-09-25T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e86bee2b-8353-48c2-8ea3-a6b2b26cdb2f_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e86bee2b-8353-48c2-8ea3-a6b2b26cdb2f_ad_dn_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/be523d65-1a1c-4af3-b2d6-c1e5bb42272f_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The effect of the 5'UTR regulatory variant, c.-118C>T, was not experimentally determined.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bc0e99f2-054c-4ae5-9398-8b82ee1e9704","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26175287","rdfs:label":"Patient 8","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":8,"detectionMethod":"Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood, nail, hair, and buccal mucosa, used for PCR and subsequent sequencing.","phenotypeFreeText":"platelet count 60x10^9/L, MPV 9.7fl, WHO bleeding scale 0","phenotypes":"obo:HP_0001873","previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"WASP, MPL, RUNX1, HOXA11, RBM8A, and CYCS were also sequenced","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/be523d65-1a1c-4af3-b2d6-c1e5bb42272f_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26175287","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/29fc063f-bfe6-40d9-9b56-23f0bb83233b","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NC_000010.11:g.27100444G>A","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA913185907"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:DeNovoAlleleOrigin"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"No"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADDeNovoCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalDominantDeNovoVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e86bee2b-8353-48c2-8ea3-a6b2b26cdb2f_ad_other_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f5b3efa9-c1c6-4ca4-bf78-7aaf09c08734_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The effect of the 5'UTR regulatory variant, c.-116C>G, was not experimentally determined.","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2730cf9b-0c39-4553-b7d5-72b4ea0d37f4","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24030261","rdfs:label":"Family 1 Proband","ageType":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/","ageUnit":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/","detectionMethod":"Screened, by unspecified methods, for mutations in the 5′ UTR of ANKRD26.","phenotypes":"obo:HP_0001873","previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f5b3efa9-c1c6-4ca4-bf78-7aaf09c08734_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24030261","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a32e9136-0f0e-4806-bab2-558010a7917a","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NC_000010.11:g.27100442G>C","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA913185915"}}}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.25},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/64ec4bc1-4c31-482d-8ea7-5fb3ab7a1267_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The 5'UTR regulatory variant, c.-128G>A, was cloned upstream of a luciferase reporter and transfected into Dami cells where overexpression was observed in both unstimulated and PMA-TPO stimulated (to induce megakaryocytic maturation) cells.

The inhibition of ANKRD26 expression led to the rescue of the profound defect in proplatelet formation (the proposed origin of the thrombocytopenia). To understand how the preserved expression of the ANKRD26 gene could alter PPT formation through a signaling defect, the authors focused on the activation of JAK/STAT, MAPK, and PI3K in response to TPO. Activation of the 3 signaling pathways was increased in MKs of patients compared with MKs of controls. They further demonstrated that RK1/2 activation at late stages of MK differentiation inhibits PPT formation through overexpression of a dominant-negative (DNMEK1) or active (MEKa) form of MEK1 in primary MKs and showed that DNMEK1 leads to a 2-fold increase in the percentage of PPT-bearing MKs while MEKa leads to a decrease.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24430186","rdfs:label":"Proplatelet Formation Rescue","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:PhenotypeRescue"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellRescueCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e86bee2b-8353-48c2-8ea3-a6b2b26cdb2f_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0863c5b1-3a09-49a3-8b70-aa2dbdc1a214","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The normal function of ANKRD26 is unclear, however the regulatory variants in the 5'UTR are thought to result in a gain of function wherein ANKRD26 would accumulate at the inner part of the cell membrane and would modify TPO/MPL signaling, leading to the MAPK/ERK overactivation, followed by a profound defect in PPT formation.","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9f0bbf8d-155f-4e46-8aa7-d5dcb83f7680","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"In controls, mature megakaryocytes showed homogeneously distributed granules and demarcation membranes (DMS) with typical organization. On the contrary, patient MKs showed a decreased concentration of granules. MKs formed thick and short cytoplasmic extensions with heterogeneous distribution of granules or fragile extensions with very thin attachment to the MK body. Frequently, within the MK cytoplasm with deformed elongated shape, the DMS system appeared to delineate areas of fragmentation instead of formation of long pseudopods. These results suggested a defect in proplatelet (PPT) formation. The ability to form PPTs was investigated in liquid medium and after adhesion on poly-L-lysine or fibrinogen substrates. In all experimental designs, there was a profound decrease in the number of PPT-forming MKs in patients compared with controls (n = 14 for controls, n = 22 for patients, P < 0.0001).
