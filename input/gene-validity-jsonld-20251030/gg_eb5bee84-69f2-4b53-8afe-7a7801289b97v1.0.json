{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/eb5bee84-69f2-4b53-8afe-7a7801289b97v1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"The AP5Z1 gene is located on chromosome 7 at 7p21.3. It encodes the zeta subunit of the adaptor-related protein complex-5, a component of the adaptor-related protein complex-5, which localizes in the late endosomes were facilitates vesicle-mediated intracellular sorting and trafficking of selected transmembrane cargo proteins.\n\nAP5Z1 was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) in 2010 (Słabicki et al., PMID: 20613862). The disorder is a slowly progressive complex spastic paraplegia of the lower limbs accompanied by other phenotypic features, including ataxia, seizures, intellectual disability, muscle atrophy, extrapyramidal disturbance, and peripheral neuropathy. Onset is typically between 10 and 59 years of age, and affected individuals often become wheelchair-dependent. Multiple unique variants have been reported in at least 21 individuals in numerous publications (PMID: 20613862, 26085577, 33543803, 27606357, 31289639). Variants in this gene segregated with the disorder in additional family members. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) was reached. Most reported variants are LoF (PMID:33543803, 20613862, 2608557) but missense variants have also been identified in several cases (PMID:24833714). Functional evidence, including immunohistochemistry and protein expression studies, supports the assumption that these variants are responsible for the patient's phenotype by acting through a loss of function mechanism (PMID:33543803). \n\nMutations in the AP5Z1 gene lead to transport defects from late endosomes to the trans-Golgi network. In vitro experiments conducted in patient's fibroblasts and knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) revealed a generalized autophagy defect under stress conditions manifested with an increased number of autophagosomes and decreased lysosome counts (PMID: 31289639, 27606357). The lysosome depletion and impaired autophagic clearance ultimately lead to aberrant multilamellar toxic storage material accumulation. The gene-disease relationship is additionally supported by AP5Z1 knockout mice that recapitulate most of the features seen in HSP patients (Khundadze M et al., 2019, PMID: 30930081).\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between the AP5Z1 gene and autosomal recessive hereditary spastic paraplegia. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in research and clinical diagnostic settings and upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Cerebral Palsy Gene Curation Expert Panel on 09/19/2022 (SOP Version 9).\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/eb5bee84-69f2-4b53-8afe-7a7801289b97","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/020a234e-180c-4d9f-8f04-bd79eac6046e","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/020a234e-180c-4d9f-8f04-bd79eac6046e_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10113","date":"2022-10-20T15:58:59.345Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/020a234e-180c-4d9f-8f04-bd79eac6046e_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10113","date":"2022-09-19T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"Consistent replication of findings ","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/020a234e-180c-4d9f-8f04-bd79eac6046e_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/020a234e-180c-4d9f-8f04-bd79eac6046e_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3875c820-152d-4af3-9f6b-7df125f323c0","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ba5fe76f-530d-4405-9d92-87884833f84c","type":"Finding","dc:description":"AP5 zeta knockout mice do not develop cognitive deficits until up to six months of age but the present loss of large diameter axons in the lumbar corticospinal tract is a typical hallmark of HSP.
