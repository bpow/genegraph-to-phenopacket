An autosomal dominant, immune dysregulation disorder with incomplete penetrance characterized by autoimmmunity (autoimmune cytopenia, hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia) and lymphoproliferation. Additional variable features may include autoimmune thyroiditis, psoriasis or eczema, nephritis, hepatitis, and symptoms of systemic lupus erythematosus. Immunodeficiency is present in some patients. Disease onset is usually in the first decades of life, although later onset has been reported. \n\nTwelve variants (missense, nonsense) that have been reported in probands in five publications (PMIDs: 39840313, 39005503, 33087723, 32853638, 32499645) are included in this curation. *SOCS1* has only one coding exon therefore non-mediated decay is not predicted for any variant. Several probands present with thrombocytopenia, hepatitis, recurrent infections, neutropenia, while others have been diagnosed with common variable immunodeficiency. Because *SOCS1* haploinsufficiency has incomplete penetrance, the phenotypic features of probands, even within the same families, exist on a wide spectrum of severity.  \n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by animal models, functional assays, and protein interactions. Model systems in mice (PMIDs: 10490099, 11371356) *SOCS1* knockout mice exhibit severe inflammation in the neonatal period which includes immune-mediated  hepatitis, and thrombocytopenia, features shared by haploinsufficient humans. Injury to the liver is shown in complete *SOCS1* knockout in mice predicts that without cross-talk inhibition via SOCS-1, IL-4 and IFN-γ signaling there is damage to various organs, localized by other factors such as susceptibility to infection. *SOCS1* plays a role in downregulating cytokine signaling by inhibiting the activity of Janus kinases (JAKs), key components of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. Functional alteration studies (PMID: 34421895) show that when *SOCS1* had reduced protein expression, organ damage through chronic infections and/or autoimmunity is predictive. Meanwhile, increased activity in the FAK – AKT – RS6K pathway may explain the accumulation of autoimmunity. Biochemical function (PMID: 9341160) and protein interactions (PMID: 29674694) further support the role of *SOCS1* to have a function consistent with the immunodeficiency phenotype observed in patients via the regulation of JAK/STAT pathways.\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between SOCS1 in relation to autosomal dominant autoinflammatory syndrome with immunodeficiency. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings. This classification was approved by the ClinGen PIRD GCEP on the meeting date February, 18, 2025 (SOP Version 11). \n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/04370aaf-e243-4081-aa04-ccb2d327854b","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/68f51e4f-ce10-493b-949a-29eda10e4ccb","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/68f51e4f-ce10-493b-949a-29eda10e4ccb_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10145","date":"2025-02-19T21:38:47.621Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/68f51e4f-ce10-493b-949a-29eda10e4ccb_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10145","date":"2025-02-18T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/68f51e4f-ce10-493b-949a-29eda10e4ccb_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2ff612c2-913b-4a1f-8431-70162b464ac2","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Scored at 50% for sharing the the same variant as another scored proband","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2ff612c2-913b-4a1f-8431-70162b464ac2_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36890397","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4e9bfd50-7c41-4253-bfc2-990be382972d","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_003745.2(SOCS1):c.480_481insGCGGC (p.Met161AlafsTer?)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA2499223194"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:DeNovoAlleleOrigin"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:Heterozygous"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ceb3ddd6-5af1-46ff-a16d-8704aa326e66","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Scored at 50% for sharing the the same variant as another scored proband","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ceb3ddd6-5af1-46ff-a16d-8704aa326e66_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36890397","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4e9bfd50-7c41-4253-bfc2-990be382972d"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:DeNovoAlleleOrigin"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:Heterozygous"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2377dad4-7d66-4809-b508-8265237c93e1","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2377dad4-7d66-4809-b508-8265237c93e1_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33087723","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e5e4e497-3483-43f4-a8f7-e8ff2d1531f7","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_003745.2(SOCS1):c.64C>T (p.Arg22Trp)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA394740825"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Heterozygous"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":0.1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/13bf01c9-c694-4d08-9578-b73a3ecd9d0c","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Downgraded because this gene has only one coding exon therefore NMD is not predicted for any variant.
