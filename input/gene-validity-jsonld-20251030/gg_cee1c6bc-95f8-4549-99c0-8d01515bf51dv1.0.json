The enzyme (cytidine-5-prime-triphosphate synthetase) is encoded by the CTPS1 gene, and important in the biosynthesis of phospholipids and nucleic acids, and plays a key role in cell growth, development, and tumorigenesis. \nOnly one unique nonsense variant (e.g. splice acceptor) has been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, and experimental data. \n\nVariants in this gene have been reported in at least 10 probands in 3 publications (PMIDs: 35983265, 24870241, 27638562).  \nThis gene-disease relationship is supported by mouse animal models (PMID: 38438357). Deletion of Ctps1 in T cells or treatment with a CTPS1 inhibitor rescued Foxp3-deficient mice from fatal systemic autoimmunity and reduced the severity of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. De novo synthesis of impaired expansion of T and B cell findings support that CTPS1 may represent a target for immune suppression. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence (e.g. expression studies) (PMIDs: 32161190, 24870241). Proliferation and IL-2 secretion by T cells in response to TCR activation were markedly decreased in all patients, while other T cell effector functions were preserved. Another functional study showed CTPS1 expression was found to be low in resting T cells, but rapidly upregulated following TCR activation. These results highlight a key and specific role of CTPS1 in the immune system by its capacity to sustain the proliferation of activated lymphocytes during the immune response. \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between CTPS1 and autosomal recessive combined immunodeficiency. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached.

However, both in humans and mice, activated CTPS1-deficient T cells retained a residual capacity to proliferate, indicating that T-cell proliferation is not fully dependent on CTPS1.\nAs we previously reported in humans, we observed in the different mouse models that T-cell proliferation upon TCR/antigenic stimulation is highly dependent on CTPS1, as well as GC B cells are.\nHerein, we show that Ctps1 but not Ctps2 is essential for life in mice. In humans, CTPS1 deficiency causes combined immunodeficiency and has no developmental effect. However, the mutation causing CTPS1 deficiency in human is hypomorphic and preserved around 10–15% of the CTPS1 expression and activity. This residual CTPS1 activity is in all likelihood sufficient for human normal development further highlighting the key role of CTPS1 in immunity and in particular in lymphocytes. Our results indicate that Ctps1 is not only mandatory for early development but also for later steps and during all life. Indeed, inducible inactivation of Ctps1 in normally developed mice results in rapid health deterioration associated with a rapid weight loss requiring the sacrifice of the animals.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38438357","rdfs:label":"Soudais KO Mouse Project consortium","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5cb3202e-9f1c-4374-931c-ae55da92e3c8","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/eda1a591-0333-44d2-b44e-b0b2347a5161","type":"Finding","dc:description":"CTPS1 mRNA expression was comparable between the different tissues, except for T cells in which CTPS1 expression was strongly up regulated after cell activation in response to TCR-CD3 and CD28 co-stimulation.
