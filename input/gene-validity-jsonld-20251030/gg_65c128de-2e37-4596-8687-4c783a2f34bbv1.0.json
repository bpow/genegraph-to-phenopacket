It is one of several human homologs of DNase I. The family of enzymes includes DNASE1, DNASE1L1, DNASE1L2 and DNASE1L3. These function as endonucleases capable of cleaving DNA. DNASE1L3, predominantly expressed in macrophages and dendritic cells (unlike the other DNase homologs, which are expressed at much lower levels in hematopoietic cells), is secreted into the circulation and is thought to have a role in the fragmentation of free plasma DNA, clearing it from circulation and reducing risk of cell-free DNA antigenicity. \n\nDNASE1L3 was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive monogenic Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) in 2011 (PMID: 22019780). At least 5 loss-of-function genetic variants (missense, nonsense, frameshift, large deletion) have been reported in humans, commonly in children from consanguineous marriages. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes multiple reports of case-level data. The initial 2011 report (PMID: 22019780) described a homozygous 1-bp deletion (c.289_290 del) in DNASE1L3 in six individuals diagnosed with childhood-onset SLE, based on clinical and serological criteria. Additional cases of childhood-onset SLE with the same base-pair deletions were reported in 2017 (PMID: 27821515), 2018 (PMID: 30008451) and 2020 (PMID: 34161863). Additional variants in the DNASE1L3 gene with manifestations of SLE and/or lupus nephritis were reported in a case series in 2021 (PMID: 35670985). \n\nThis gene-disease relationship is supported by expression studies showing that the c.289_290 deletion mutation is associated with decreased expression of *DNASE1L3* RNA levels (PMID: 23666765). A SNP in *DNASE1L3* that is associated with increased SLE risk was also shown to be associated with decreased protein secretion of DNASE1L3 (PMID: 33455918). Decreased serum levels of DNASE1L3 are observed in the general SLE (and inflammatory myositis) population as compared to healthy controls; in SLE, lower DNASE1L3 levels are associated with higher clinical disease scores (PMID: 28039554). Animal models show that mice with DNASE1L3 deletion develop anti-DNA autoantibodies and lupus nephritis (PMID: 28039554). Deletion of *DNASE1L3* resulted in aberrations in the fragmentation of plasma DNA (PMID: 30593563); these aberrant DNA fragments were also present in the circulation of patients with the *DNASE1L3* disease-associated variants, but not in healthy controls (PMID: 33022220). In mice with the *DNASE1L3* deletion, the phenotype of aberrant DNA fragments in the peripheral circulation could be rescued by restoring DNASE1L3 production using viral vectors (PMID: 33022220).\n\nMore evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic and experimental evidence (18 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism for disease is homozygous loss of function.\n  \nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between *DNASE1L3* and autosomal recessive monogenic Systemic Lupus Erythematosus. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/65c128de-2e37-4596-8687-4c783a2f34bb","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/77450e46-30fa-4be0-aa0e-4e31f04a117e","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/77450e46-30fa-4be0-aa0e-4e31f04a117e_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10123","date":"2024-06-14T17:02:13.944Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/77450e46-30fa-4be0-aa0e-4e31f04a117e_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10123","date":"2024-05-08T19:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/77450e46-30fa-4be0-aa0e-4e31f04a117e_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c0a8c912-3c1e-401d-9643-db6265d1af74_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0e5ff618-0bc7-41c0-81cf-aa862d03eb92","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":4,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0e5ff618-0bc7-41c0-81cf-aa862d03eb92_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"Using a minigene assay, this variant was shown to lead to exon 4 skipping, shifting the reading frame and terminating at position Ter19.","functionalDataSupport":"Yes"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0e5ff618-0bc7-41c0-81cf-aa862d03eb92_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35670985","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/880d234c-d641-40b8-97f6-b7cbc04a3488","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_004944.4(DNASE1L3):c.433G>A (p.Ala145Thr)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA2470017"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":4},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c0a8c912-3c1e-401d-9643-db6265d1af74","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35670985","rdfs:label":"Tusseau Pt2","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":11,"allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/880d234c-d641-40b8-97f6-b7cbc04a3488"},"detectionMethod":"Coding regions of the DNASE1L3 gene were directly sequenced by Sanger sequencing.","firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"The patient is a young girl from Arab descent.

Before admission, she had two episodes of unexplained urticaria. Initial laboratory testing revealed hypocomplementemia, highly positive anti-C1q antibodies, and positive anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA). Serological markers of SLE were negative, except for anticardiolipin antibodies. Her clinical condition deteriorated rapidly. A kidney biopsy performed four days after admission demonstrated a severe, unusual form of immune complex-mediated glomerulonephritis, including glomerular, tubulointerstitial, and vascular lesions. Notably, advanced chronic sclerosing lesions were already present. The histopathology was found to be consistent with small vessel vasculitis. Atypical systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and hypocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis syndrome were considered.\nDespite aggressive treatment with methylprednisolone, cyclophosphamide, rituximab, plasmapheresis and hemodialysis, her kidney function never recovered. She is currently undergoing maintenance hemodialysis. All immunosuppressive drugs were gradually weaned off. Subsequently, subtle cutaneous vasculitis manifestations involving her palms and soles were noticed, and mycophenolate mofetil and hydroxychloroquine were introduced.\nThe work-up for kidney transplantation prompted a reevaluation of her histopathology. A more accurate diagnosis was required to predict future management and graft outcomes.\n","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/065e8089-8dd9-439d-a608-8ab4efd675ce_variant_evidence_item"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria","strengthScore":0.2},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/77450e46-30fa-4be0-aa0e-4e31f04a117e_seg_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d925be50-28c1-4923-a8d5-0188beb8574f_proband_segregation","type":"FamilyCosegregation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34161863","rdfs:label":"Ekinci_Family 1","estimatedLodScore":0.25,"family":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d925be50-28c1-4923-a8d5-0188beb8574f","type":"Family","rdfs:label":"Ekinci_Family 1","member":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7a128c13-a8ef-4591-aa1e-a3803f06fab8"}},"meetsInclusionCriteria":false,"phenotypeFreeText":"ANA positive, dsDNA positive, low complements, lupus nephritis biopsy confirmed, recurrent urticarial rash","phenotypeNegativeAlleleNegative":2,"phenotypePositiveAllelePositive":1,"proband":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7a128c13-a8ef-4591-aa1e-a3803f06fab8"}},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fca3eab2-13d1-46c2-b7eb-103533af0bd0_proband_segregation","type":"FamilyCosegregation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22019780","rdfs:label":"Al-Mayouf F4","estimatedLodScore":0.73,"family":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fca3eab2-13d1-46c2-b7eb-103533af0bd0","type":"Family","rdfs:label":"Al-Mayouf F4","member":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/99bcd25e-3b5e-486c-b0e5-ac14146d034a"}},"meetsInclusionCriteria":false,"phenotypeFreeText":"anti-nuclear antibody, low c3 and c4","phenotypeNegativeAlleleNegative":1,"phenotypePositiveAllelePositive":2,"phenotypes":["obo:HP_0020151","obo:HP_0032230"],"proband":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/99bcd25e-3b5e-486c-b0e5-ac14146d034a"}},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/dd9ada81-1a85-4cab-a59e-c80a1560a587_proband_segregation","type":"FamilyCosegregation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22019780","rdfs:label":"Al-Mayouf F2","estimatedLodScore":1.83,"family":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/dd9ada81-1a85-4cab-a59e-c80a1560a587","type":"Family","rdfs:label":"Al-Mayouf F2","member":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4bf1b2cf-1e1b-4839-be5a-73307b8e78aa"}},"meetsInclusionCriteria":false,"phenotypeFreeText":"anti-nuclear antibody, low c3 and c4, anti-cardiolipin","phenotypeNegativeAlleleNegative":5,"phenotypePositiveAllelePositive":3,"phenotypes":["obo:HP_0020151","obo:HP_0032230","obo:HP_0033726"],"proband":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4bf1b2cf-1e1b-4839-be5a-73307b8e78aa"}},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f2d62a87-2f3a-440e-9d13-4fdfa92ec2b1_proband_segregation","type":"FamilyCosegregation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35670985","rdfs:label":"Tusseau Family D","family":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f2d62a87-2f3a-440e-9d13-4fdfa92ec2b1","type":"Family","rdfs:label":"Tusseau Family D","member":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1e1a859d-d497-424e-b5c4-51bba450075b"}},"phenotypePositiveAllelePositive":1,"proband":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1e1a859d-d497-424e-b5c4-51bba450075b"}},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3decd59e-b044-4f83-8237-67c4d64fbb63_proband_segregation","type":"FamilyCosegregation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35670985","rdfs:label":"Tusseau Family B","estimatedLodScore":0.25,"family":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3decd59e-b044-4f83-8237-67c4d64fbb63","type":"Family","rdfs:label":"Tusseau Family B","member":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c0a8c912-3c1e-401d-9643-db6265d1af74"}},"phenotypeNegativeAlleleNegative":2,"phenotypePositiveAllelePositive":1,"proband":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c0a8c912-3c1e-401d-9643-db6265d1af74"}},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3e21801a-d620-4696-be21-bdc42fb1e119_proband_segregation","type":"FamilyCosegregation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27821515","rdfs:label":"Carbonella_Family1","estimatedLodScore":1.93,"family":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3e21801a-d620-4696-be21-bdc42fb1e119","type":"Family","rdfs:label":"Carbonella_Family1","member":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3b1972e8-b2cb-476a-98ce-be8ce1609b0c","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27821515","rdfs:label":"Carbonella et al.
