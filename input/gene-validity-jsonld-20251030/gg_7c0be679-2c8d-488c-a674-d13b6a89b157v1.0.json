Biallelic variants in ALG6 variants have been definitively demonstrated to cause congenital disorder of glycosylation, type Ic (CDG-1c; OMIM #603147). However, cystic kidney disease has not been reported as a part of the phenotypic spectrum of this condition thus far. Given the different inheritance modes and phenotypes associated with ALG6-related ADPKD and ALG6-related CDG-1c, we have split the two disease entities. As noted above, this curation is related to the association between ALG6 and ADPKD. So far, 6 variants (4 loss of function and 2 missense) have been reported in literature, to be associated with ADPKD, of which the 2 missense variants are reported as variants of uncertain significance (VUS) and 3 out 4 loss of function variants are reported as Likely Pathogenic (LP) or Pathogenic (P) in ClinVar; but in relation to the autosomal recessive congenital disorder of glycosylation condition. Patients with ADPKD phenotypes reported in these studies are also reported to occasionally present with polycystic liver disease (PMIDs: 32398770, 36807342). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data for all variants and additional experimental data for a recurrent variant. No other functional studies demonstrating the role of ALG6 in renal function or cyst formation have been published so far.\nThough no evidence currently contradicts this gene-disease relationship, more evidence is required to demonstrate an unequivocal causal role for ALG6 in cystic kidney disease. However, there are many individuals in the general population harboring variants ALG6 (including those reported as disease-causing in the two publications and LP/P variants in ClinVar) that do not have any reported cystic phenotype, indicating that truncating variants in ALG6 may either be risk alleles for polycystic kidney phenotypes, or this gene-disease relationship may have low penetrance.\nIn summary, there is currently Limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. This gene-disease pair was evaluated as limited and approved by the Kidney Cystic and Ciliopathy Disorders GCEP on 10/25/2023 in accordance with SOP Version 9.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7c0be679-2c8d-488c-a674-d13b6a89b157","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b4d62da9-8878-494e-b36b-7025fc31a428","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b4d62da9-8878-494e-b36b-7025fc31a428_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10066","date":"2024-04-29T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b4d62da9-8878-494e-b36b-7025fc31a428_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10066","date":"2024-04-02T17:08:06.288Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"  ","curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b4d62da9-8878-494e-b36b-7025fc31a428_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4b03634b-4dcd-4245-82e7-84a186ae79e7","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Though this is a recurrent variant c.257+5G>A seen in 4 unrelated patients in this study, there are 133 heterozygotes in ExAC and therefore, it's score of 2 has been downgraded to 1. \n","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4b03634b-4dcd-4245-82e7-84a186ae79e7_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"The variant was shown to cause exon 4 skipping (Fig.S10)","functionalDataSupport":"Yes"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4b03634b-4dcd-4245-82e7-84a186ae79e7_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36807342","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/433866b9-ddb8-49ee-b9eb-f83a8ae7a2eb","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_013339.4(ALG6):c.257+5G>A","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA223057"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:AlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Heterozygous"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/182ea3af-5525-4505-b945-b6ff413ae53c","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Already scored in another individual.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Inconclusive","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/182ea3af-5525-4505-b945-b6ff413ae53c_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"Fig. S10 shows variant causes exon 4 skipping","functionalDataSupport":"Yes"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/182ea3af-5525-4505-b945-b6ff413ae53c_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36807342","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/433866b9-ddb8-49ee-b9eb-f83a8ae7a2eb"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:AlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Heterozygous"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cdb0c985-4f55-4bb2-a325-f7c58e0599d7","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Though this was seen only in 4 heterozygotes in ExAC, and classified previously as LP/P in ClinVar for AR congenital disorders of glycosylation, carriers in previous studies did not exhibit renal cysts, therefore downgrading.","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cdb0c985-4f55-4bb2-a325-f7c58e0599d7_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36807342","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/55fe91d3-f2a9-4335-b130-e44d736681dd","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_013339.4(ALG6):c.257+2dup","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA888108"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:AlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Heterozygous"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/496c966c-4c24-419b-b6d0-fa1b7d0a42ba","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Though this was found in 2 heterozygotes in ExAC, and previously classified as LP/P for AR congenital disorder of glycosylation, carriers of this variant in previous studies did not have cystic kidney phenotypes, so downgraded from 1.5 to 1.
