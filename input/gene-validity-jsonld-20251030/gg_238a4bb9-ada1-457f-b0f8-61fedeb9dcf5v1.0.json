{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/238a4bb9-ada1-457f-b0f8-61fedeb9dcf5v1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"The relationship between COX4I1 and Leigh syndrome spectrum was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of December 16, 2020. The COX4I1 gene encodes cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV) subunit 4I1. Defects of this protein lead to complex IV deficiency.\n\nThe COX4I1 gene has been reported only once in relation to autosomal recessive Leigh syndrome spectrum, in 2019 (PMID: 31290619), and this has been the only case reported to date. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included one homozygous variant identified in one case in one publication (PMID: 31290619). No segregation data were available. Loss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease association is also supported by biochemical function, expression, and animal models (PMIDs: 28593021, 18853439, 31127358).\n\nIn summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on December 16, 2020 (SOP Version 7).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/238a4bb9-ada1-457f-b0f8-61fedeb9dcf5","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d56c1fe4-7711-45f4-992c-7e9586b9efc6","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d56c1fe4-7711-45f4-992c-7e9586b9efc6_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2021-04-09T13:58:33.321Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d56c1fe4-7711-45f4-992c-7e9586b9efc6_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2021-04-09T13:58:24.042Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d56c1fe4-7711-45f4-992c-7e9586b9efc6_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d56c1fe4-7711-45f4-992c-7e9586b9efc6_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5921b1ef-3a52-4542-aea3-5fb2f1d8b9ac","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"0.5pts for embryonic lethality.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0316bcb1-7e17-4acf-bce1-89bc082f27e5","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Cox4i1tm1.1(KOMP)Vlcg: Reporter-tagged deletion allele (post Cre, with no selection cassette)(https://www.mousephenotype.org/data/genes/MGI:88473)\nThe homozygous mouse is noted to be embryonic lethal prior to organogenesis (E9.5).\nThe heterozygous KO mouse is noted to have abnormal midbrain and hindbrain development and abnormal neural closure.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31127358","rdfs:label":"IMPC KO mouse","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d56c1fe4-7711-45f4-992c-7e9586b9efc6_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7e4ecf55-6c1c-47b6-be28-81d8dfbb71d8","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"27977873: Rahman 2017 (LeighMa)p: COX8A, NDUFA4 complex IV subunits and  SURF1, SCO2, COX10, COX15, PET100 complex IV assembly units are associated with LSS. \nScored according to rubric: 6-9 gene products","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fb9ea53b-8d92-47b2-a990-15aa265938cf","type":"Finding","dc:description":"The largest of the nuclear-encoded subunits, COX subunit IV, is located adjacent to the catalytic subunits, containing numerous contact sites with subunits I\nand II .
