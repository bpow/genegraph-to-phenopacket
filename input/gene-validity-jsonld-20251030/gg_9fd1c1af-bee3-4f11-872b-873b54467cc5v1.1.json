{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9fd1c1af-bee3-4f11-872b-873b54467cc5v1.1","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"The RDH5 gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive “RDH5-related retinopathy” in 1999 (Yamamoto et al, PMID 10369264). Biallelic variants in RDH5 have been reported in individuals with various clinical features. Many individuals are reported to have fundus albipunctatus, with night blindness from childhood, stationary or slow progression of rod abnormalities, frequent and progressive cone abnormalities in older age, the presence of white dots in the retina, and cone dystrophy developing with age in some patients while others have been diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa. Due to the variability in phenotype, for this curation, these phenotypes have been lumped together as “RDH5-related retinopathy”. To date, over 40 variants in the RDH5 gene have been reported in individuals with retinal dystrophy, and most of them are missense variants (Skorczyk-Werner et al 2015, PMID 25820994). Here, eleven unique variants in eleven probands were curated from seven publications (Yamamoto et al, 1999, PMID 10369264; Gonzalez-Fernandez et al, 1999, PMID 10617778; Nakamura et al, 2000, PMID 11053295; Wada et al, 2001, PMID 11448328; Pras et al, 2012, PMID 22815624; Almutairi et al, 2020, PMID 33369259; Katagiri et al, 2020, PMID 32232344). These variants included missense, nonsense, and frameshift variants in addition to one variant, c.928delCinsGAAG (p.Leu310GluVal), which is commonly identified in Japanese patients (Nakamura et al, 2000, PMID 11053295; Katagiri et al, 2020, PMID 32232344; Skorczyk-Werner et al 2015, PMID 25820994). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is loss of function. Of note, in two reported patients, only a single variant was identified (Pras et al, 2012, PMID: 22815624). However, there is currently insufficient evidence to indicate that a single RDH5 variant can cause retinal disease. \nThe gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence including the function of the RDH5 gene product in the visual cycle, which is consistent with the features noted in patients with biallelic variants (Driessen et al, 1995, PMID 7544779), the expression pattern of RDH5, specifically in the retinal pigment epithelium (Driessen et al, 1995, PMID 7544779; Swamy and McGaughey, 2019, PMID 31343654), physical interaction of RDH5 with RPE65, another gene implicated in retinal dystrophy with a role in the visual cycle (Aoun et al, 2021, PMID 34281261), and the features of an rdh5 knock-out mouse (Driessen et al, 2000, PMID 10825191).\nIn summary, RDH5 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive RDH5-related retinopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Retina GCEP (SOP v8) on September 2, 2021.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9fd1c1af-bee3-4f11-872b-873b54467cc5","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5399fd62-ca69-4665-b3ba-c15ceefbf6d9","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5399fd62-ca69-4665-b3ba-c15ceefbf6d9_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10072","date":"2022-05-24T16:48:22.397Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5399fd62-ca69-4665-b3ba-c15ceefbf6d9_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10072","date":"2021-09-02T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5399fd62-ca69-4665-b3ba-c15ceefbf6d9_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c3d5cc4d-9eed-496b-9897-4bd7b9ba71ae_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c3d5cc4d-9eed-496b-9897-4bd7b9ba71ae","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22815624","rdfs:label":"17-1","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":50,"allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/060f2cac-86fe-4eb0-a7d9-d2e132da3e91","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_002905.4(RDH5):c.160C>T (p.Arg54Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA6616756"}},"detectionMethod":"The 5′ untranslated region (UTR) of the RDH5 gene and all exons and their boundaries were amplified and sequenced.

A protein of ~ 32 kDa co-immunoprecipitated with RPE65. Partial amino acid sequence of the 32 kDa protein was obtained allowing degenerate primers to be made which resulted in generation of a probe that was used to screen a bovine cDNA library. The full length cDNA was predicted to code for a protein of 318 amino acids with retinal dehydrogenase activity, later named as RDH5.\nBiallelic variants in RPE65 are responsible for up to 1.5% of inherited retinal dystrophies, based on one review published in 2021 (PMID: 34281261). Hence, RDH5 has been shown to interact with another protein encoded by a gene which is responsible for the same phenotype, when altered.

Of note, another publication from around the same time (Simon et al, 1995, PMID 7836368) also reported cloning of the bovine RDH5 cDNA and retinol dehydrogenase activity when the cDNA was expressed in COS cells.\nThe function of RDH5 is consistent with the phenotype observed in individuals with biallelic variants. RDH5 catalyzes the conversion of 11-cis-retinol to 11-cis-retinal in the RPE. This is the final step in a series of reactions known as the retinoid cycle which regenerates visual pigment after photo-activation. Without this function, the visual pigment cannot be regenerated and hence, dark adaptation is expected to be slow.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7544779","rdfs:label":"Bovine RDH5 cDNA cloning and function","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5399fd62-ca69-4665-b3ba-c15ceefbf6d9_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b30d3701-4eb0-4412-960f-c1bca5052946","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The score is reduced because these mice appear to have a milder phenotype than humans, with delayed dark adaptation only under conditions of high bleaching, and no evidence of flecks in the retina (punctata).

Rdh5-/- mice developed normally, including their retinas (Fig 3), with no appreciable loss of photoreceptors. The fundus appeared normal and punctata were not present. \nMice had normal rod and cone responses and, unlike humans, dark adaptation was normal except after high bleaching levels when dark adaptation was delayed. In summary, the phenotype in mice appears milder than in humans. Of note, a large increase in the 11-cis-retinyl ester concentration was noticed in the knockout mice compared with wild type. While punctata were not observed in the knock out mice, it is suspected that the punctate in humans may represent local accumulations of 11- and 13-cis-retinyl esters, which does correspond to the observation of elevated 11- cis-retinyl esters in mice.
