{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/74554bce-3add-44bf-a890-81e47f70e7d5v1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"ATF6 was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive early-onset retinopathy and/or achromatopsia in 2015 (Xu et al., PMID: 26070061; Kohl et al., PMID: 26029869; Ansar et al., PMID: 26063662). The term ATF6-related retinopathy is used here to describe the disease entity associated with this gene. Achromatopsia is an early-onset retinal dystrophy characterized by impaired color vision, photophobia, nystagmus, reduced visual acuity. Additional features on ocular exam include foveal hypoplasia and cone photoreceptor dysfunction. Twelve variants (missense, frameshift, nonsense, splice site) that have been reported in sixteen probands in five publications (PMIDs: 26070061, 26029869; 26063662, 28041643, 31237654) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. For example, of note, two multi-exon deletions in ATF6 were reported by Lee et al. (PMID: 32271167) as causative for autosomal recessive achromatopsia in two families, though these variants were not scored as part of this curation. The mechanism of pathogenicity is known to be loss-of-function. This gene-disease association is also supported by experimental evidence, including animal studies, expression studies, and in vitro functional assays (PMID: 26063662, 26029869, 26070061, 32271167, 28028229, 34561305). ATF6 has been shown to be expressed in mouse retina (PMID: 26070061). While wildtype ATF6 has been shown in vitro to have expression throughout the cytoplasm and localization to the ER, mutant ATF6 had significantly reduced localization in the cytoplasm (PMID: 26063662). In addition, ATF6 variants have been shown to impaired transcriptional activity in vitro (PMID: 32271167). Knockout Atf6 mice have functional deficits in photoreceptor cells (PMID: 26029869. However, the phenotype of Atf6 knock out mice does not completely recapitulate the features of human achromatopsia, as alterations in photoreceptor function are only seen at an older age in mice. Retinal organoids derived from human iPSCs with ATF6 variants are shown to have abnormal cone photoreceptor cells, lacking inner and outer segments, but typical rod photoreceptors (PMID: 34561305). In summary, ATF6 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive ATF6 retinopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Retina GCEP on the meeting date 10/07/2021 (SOP Version #8). This gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the General GCEP on 11/16/2016 and reevaluated by the Retina GCEP in 2021. As a result of this reevaluation, the classification changed. The original classification was Strong and it was re-classified to Definitive due to additional genetic and experimental evidence and the demonstration of evidence for this gene-disease relationship over six years. This classification was approved by the Retina GCEP on Oct 7, 2021.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/74554bce-3add-44bf-a890-81e47f70e7d5","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/649d690a-8457-4c95-8d27-978daf4ac877","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/649d690a-8457-4c95-8d27-978daf4ac877_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10072","date":"2021-10-07T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/649d690a-8457-4c95-8d27-978daf4ac877_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10072","date":"2022-03-02T21:42:59.231Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"Based on the number of points awarded.","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/649d690a-8457-4c95-8d27-978daf4ac877_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/649d690a-8457-4c95-8d27-978daf4ac877_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/56d94666-a30a-4cc0-bfce-be21555d02ad","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Phenotype of Atf6 knock out mice does not completely recapitulate the features of human achromatopsia.
