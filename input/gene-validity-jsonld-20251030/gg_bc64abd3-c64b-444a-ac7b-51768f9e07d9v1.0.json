The known spectrum of disease continued to expand with the 2006 identification of *FOXE3* variants in cases of congenital primary aphakia, with an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance (PMID: 16826526). *FOXE3* variants have since been identified as the basis for both autosomal recessive and autosomal dominant cases of congenital cataract (PMID: 17893665, PMID: 20806047), indicating the potential for a broad range of phenotypic presentations. Cases diagnosed with anterior segment dysgenesis 2 generally exhibit features such as congenital aphakia, aplasia or hypoplasia of the iris, microphthalmia, Peters anomaly, anterior chamber synechiae, corneal opacity, cataract, coloboma, reduced visual acuity, and/or developmental glaucoma. Cases diagnosed as cataract 34 generally present with congenital cataract either in isolation or accompanied by additional ocular features such as microphthalmia and/or corneal opacity. Cases with autosomal recessive inheritance generally have more severe presentation than those with autosomal dominant inheritance. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping & Splitting Working Group, the phenotypic variability between cases of anterior segment dysgenesis 2 (MIM# 610256, MONDO:0014508) and cataract 34 (MIM# 612968) appears to represent a spectrum of disease rather than separate disease entities. Despite variability in the mode of inheritance across published cases, the molecular mechanism appears to be *FOXE3* loss of function, either by two null or hypomorphic alleles or one dominant negative allele. Therefore, cases caused by inherited *FOXE3* variants have been lumped into a single disease entity, referred to as FOXE3-related anterior segment dysgenesis, with a semidominant mode of inheritance.\n\nEleven suspected disease-causing variants were scored as part of this curation (one nonsense, two frameshift, four missense, and four stop-loss), which have been collectively reported in eleven probands in nine publications (PMID: 11159941, PMID: 16826526, PMID: 17893665, PMID: 19708017, PMID: 20140963, PMID: 20806047, PMID: 21150893, PMID: 25504734, PMID: 27218149). Four of the probands scored in this curation harbored a heterozygous stop-loss variant near the 3’ end of the *FOXE3* coding region, while the other seven probands harbored biallelic nonsense, frameshift, or missense *FOXE3* variants. Missense variants were generally located within the forkhead domain responsible for DNA binding. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss of *FOXE3* function conferred by either monoallelic dominant negative variants or biallelic null and/or hypomorphic variants. Null or hypmorphic variants do not appear to cause disease in the heterozygous state, as the carriers from families with autosomal recessive inheritance are all reportedly unaffected. Two families with segregation evidence contributed to the scoring of the gene-disease relationship (PMID: 17893665). Additional probands and family segregation evidence were available but not necessary to include, as the maximum scoring for these evidence types had already been reached.\n\nThis gene-disease association is also supported by biochemical evidence that *FOXE3* encodes a transcription factor that coordinates lens development through control of gene expression (PMID: 27218149). Consistent with this finding, *in situ* hybridization studies in mouse embryos have shown that *Foxe3* is specifically expressed in the developing lens (PMID: 10652278). Spontaneous and targeted mouse models of homozygous *Foxe3* disruption recapitulate human patient features such as microphakia, microcoria, microphthalmia, cataract, corneal opacity, corneolenticular adhesions (PMID: 10652278, PMID: 16199865). These models also provide additional insight into disease processes at the histological level, including reduced proliferation and enhanced apoptosis of lens epithelial cells (PMID: 10652278) and disrupted expression of key markers of eye development (PMID: 16199865).\n\nIn summary, *FOXE3* reached a definitive association with FOXE3-related anterior segment dysgenesis. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both research and diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time without the emergence of contradictory evidence, leading to a Definitive classification. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Glaucoma / Neuro-Opthalmology Gene Curation Expert Panel on July 20th, 2023 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bc64abd3-c64b-444a-ac7b-51768f9e07d9","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c3d96af7-fd6a-4c40-b9db-3c1cd1df17a3","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c3d96af7-fd6a-4c40-b9db-3c1cd1df17a3_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10077","date":"2025-04-15T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c3d96af7-fd6a-4c40-b9db-3c1cd1df17a3_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10077","date":"2025-05-16T15:19:56.853Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c3d96af7-fd6a-4c40-b9db-3c1cd1df17a3_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8f56e22b-0150-4324-8afd-2afe92806893","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The variant has been up-scored since it matches the pattern of dominant variants in FOXE3, but limited due to the lack of evidence of a dominant negative effect.","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8f56e22b-0150-4324-8afd-2afe92806893_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"Luciferase reporter experiments were performed to look for a dominant negative loss-of-function effect, however, no evidence was found of an effect on wild-type FOXE3 (PMID: 19708017, Figure 1).","functionalDataSupport":"No"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8f56e22b-0150-4324-8afd-2afe92806893_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19708017","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8f22b7f9-8bb8-41d4-bb13-c155727fc163","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_012186.3(FOXE3):c.958T>C (p.Ter320Arg)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA340251208"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:Heterozygous"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonNullVariantCriteria"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c646a143-e021-4076-b289-a88dc3df8fb4","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c646a143-e021-4076-b289-a88dc3df8fb4_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"NM_012186.3(FOXE3):c.720C>A (p.Cys240Ter) is a nonsense variant in exon 1 of 1 and is predicted to truncate the C-terminal 25% of the protein product.","functionalDataSupport":"Yes"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c646a143-e021-4076-b289-a88dc3df8fb4_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16826526","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7d994ac9-cb2d-43ce-9b0e-11267b724a35","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_012186.3(FOXE3):c.720C>A (p.Cys240Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA119630"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:Heterozygous"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonNullVariantCriteria"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2a8c3c49-43d0-48f8-afc4-78dc43a321e1","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Scoring is recommended at 0.5 points (1 point total) since the variant is not subject to nonsense-mediated decay, and in order to moderately down-score for family consanguinity.","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2a8c3c49-43d0-48f8-afc4-78dc43a321e1_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"Transfection of the variant into HEK-293 cells harboring the DNAJB1-GLuc-SEAP reporter vector was associated with decreased expression of luciferase, indicating loss of ability to transactivate expression of the target *DNAJB1*.

Expression of other key markers of eye development, such as Prox1, is disrupted (Figs. 5C, 5D).","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16199865","rdfs:label":"Targeted knockout mouse model of Foxe3","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3c254116-dde2-45da-a971-c825bb137c77","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Default scoring is considered appropriate as the model recapitulates the mode of inheritance as well as the key ocular features of the human patients including anterior segment dysgenesis and cataract development.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/77a05c61-9c50-4793-83e0-4dbc2b7ddd0e","type":"Finding","dc:description":"The model exhibits eye abnormalities such as reduced proliferation of the lens epithelium (Fig. 3h, Fig. 5), small lens (Fig. 3d, Table 1), anterior lens cell apoptosis (Fig. 6o, 6p), absence of secondary lens fibers (Figs. 3g, 3h), cataract formation (Table 1), failure of the lens vesicle to separate from the cornea (Figs. 3d, 3f), ejection of lens material to the exterior (Fig. 3b), smaller eye (PMID: 109409), and corneal opacity (PMID: 109409).","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10652278","rdfs:label":"The dyl mouse has spontaneous Foxe3 disruption","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c3d96af7-fd6a-4c40-b9db-3c1cd1df17a3_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/aa2f9762-baa1-4ffa-9f59-2ccd58acf8d2","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Default scoring is considered appropriate since the biochemical function of FOXE3 is consistent with its proposed role in lens development and the early onset of lens defects in the human patients.","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1b5173e4-bb86-4c04-bad6-1e15370a902f","type":"Finding","dc:description":"The article provides an example of the function of FOXE3 as a transcription factor, including a target gene with a key function in the lens.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27218149","rdfs:label":"FOXE3 encodes a transcription factor for lens development.","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6fc302fe-7cbb-45e8-ac64-d5e48585e0af","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Although FOXE3 expression across adult human tissues does not necessarily match the tissues affected in the disease state, embryonic staining in the mouse appears to be highly specific to the developing lens, identifying a role for the transcription factor in the proper development of this tissue.
