This function is critical for maintaining inhibitory signaling in the central nervous system. Atypical glycine encephalopathy, also known as GLYT1 encephalopathy (OMIM #617301), is a rare neonatal-onset disorder characterized by severe hypotonia, respiratory failure, arthrogryposis multiplex congenita, dysmorphic facial features, and abnormal brain MRI findings. Despite normal or only mildly elevated serum glycine levels, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) glycine is consistently elevated. Most patients die in infancy.\nThis gene-disease relationship is supported by genetic evidence from six probands across five publications. These include four individuals with predicted or proven null variants (PMIDs: 27773429, 33269555), and two individuals with missense variants (PMIDs: 27481395, 32712301, 36195292). Functional studies in recombinant systems demonstrated that *SLC6A9* variants resulted in severely diminished or absent transport activity (PMID: 32712301). All probands presented with consistent phenotypes and were homozygous due to consanguinity. The total genetic evidence score was 6.6 points. Segregation data from two families contributed an additional 1.2 points (PMIDs: 27773429, 36195292).\nExperimental evidence further supports this gene-disease relationship. Expression studies confirmed that GLYT1 is highly expressed in the brainstem and spinal cord, consistent with the neurological phenotype (PMID: 27773429). Biochemical function studies established that GLYT1 is a sodium- and chloride-dependent glycine transporter essential for regulating glycine levels at inhibitory synapses (PMID: 8183239). Non-human model organisms, including Slc6a9-null mice and zebrafish, recapitulated key features of the human phenotype. Slc6a9-null mice exhibited lethargy, hypotonia, respiratory failure, and early death (PMID: 14622582), while slc6a9 mutant zebrafish showed neuromuscular abnormalities such as reduced spontaneous coiling and absent swimming behavior (PMID: 16014722). Additional mouse models with conditional GlyT1 deletion confirmed elevated CSF glycine and neurological symptoms (PMID: 27773429). The total experimental evidence score was 5.5 points.\nIn summary, there is Definitive evidence to support the relationship between *SLC6A9* and autosomal recessive atypical glycine encephalopathy, demonstrated through robust genetic and experimental data, and has been upheld over time.

In samples from WT mice, median CSF glycine concentrations of 29 μM were observed, whereas bolus application of the irreversible GlyT1 inhibitor ALX5407 (10 mg/kg), essentially abolishing GlyT1 activity, caused an elevation of the median CSF glycine concentration to 68.5 μM within 12 hr (p < 0.01). At this time point, the mice developed pronounced hypoactivity and labored breathing with intermittent hypertonic seizures, more so of the hind limbs. To test for the effects of a chronic reduction in GlyT1 activity on the CSF and blood glycine concentrations, we made use of the previously described symptom-free adult GlyT1fl/fl/GFAP-Cre mice, which show a more than 90% reduction in GlyT1 activity in the brain stem and spinal cord. Here too, only a mild but significant elevation of the extracellular glycine concentration (median 79.5 μM) was observed (p < 0.01).\n\nThese data support the idea that the mild elevation in CSF glycine, as observed in both probands with homozygous GLYT1 deficiency, is indeed caused by a loss of GLYT1 activity and not by additional possibly unrecognized mechanisms. Furthermore, total blood glycine concentrations were similar in samples from WT, ALX5407-treated WT, and GlyT1fl/fl/GFAP-Cre mice, confirming that the effect of GlyT1 deficiency on glycine concentration is restricted to the CNS at large.
