{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/dc606c91-29a3-4169-8981-2e591cdf52edv1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"The relationship between PDHB and Leigh syndrome spectrum was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of July 13, 2020. The PDHB gene encodes the E1 beta subunit of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC). PDC catalyzes conversion of pyruvate into acetyl-CoA, thus is the link between glycolysis and the citric acid cycle. PDC deficiency leads to impaired energy metabolism.\n\nThe PDHB gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Leigh syndrome spectrum in 2009 (PMID: 19924563). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included three variants identified in seven cases in two publications (PMIDs: 21914562, 19924563). Of note, those with PDHB deficiency can also have structural brain abnormalities (corpus callosum abnormalities) and microcephaly. In addition, several affected individuals have neonatal lactic acidosis, raising the possibility that some affected individuals die before they would have developed Leigh syndrome spectrum.  No segregation data were available. Loss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease association is also supported by known biochemical function, expression, functional alteration in patient cells, and animal models (PMIDs: 27977873, 25613900, 25356417, 29501567, 31127358).\n\nIn summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on July 13, 2020 (SOP Version 7).\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/dc606c91-29a3-4169-8981-2e591cdf52ed","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/133f688f-b498-4f5e-bd9b-b3406880ddd4","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/133f688f-b498-4f5e-bd9b-b3406880ddd4_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2021-03-11T17:29:02.792Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/133f688f-b498-4f5e-bd9b-b3406880ddd4_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2021-03-11T17:28:53.362Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/133f688f-b498-4f5e-bd9b-b3406880ddd4_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/133f688f-b498-4f5e-bd9b-b3406880ddd4_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/eda707fc-3869-4943-82ab-e89270d6fc50","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"This model recaptulates some of the features associated with disease.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/12d9afad-59bf-4913-aa80-b36aaf1ce694","type":"Finding","dc:description":"(1)\tdPDHB knockdown flies also manifested the abnormal morphology of the compound eye in adults which is not caused by the promotion of apoptosis in eye imaginal discs. \n(2)\tCrawling (larval) and climbing (adult) assays  – reduced locomotor abilities of flies in both larval and adult stages accompanied by abnormal morphology of the synapses at neuromuscular junctions and mitochondrial fragmentation in brains. \n(3)\tdPDHB knockdown flies show shortened adult lifespan. \nThese results indicate that dPDHB plays a critical role in morphogenesis, and function of motor neurons. dPDHB knockdown flies provide evidence to confirm the potential for the involvement of PDHB in neurological diseases including peripheral neuropathy.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29501567","rdfs:label":"Drosophila model with neuron-specific knockdown of dPDHB","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/295e6c94-1bf1-4bb2-bd5a-f816e0d752c5","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Reduced scoring for abnormal phenotype and preweaning lethality.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b985062f-40f9-4bba-a166-0acb04d77786","type":"Finding","dc:description":"The homozygous knockout mice present with abnormal retinal blood vessel morphology, embryonic lethality prior to tooth bud stage, preweaning lethality, incomplete penetrance.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31127358","rdfs:label":"Mouse model-MGI:6257416","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/133f688f-b498-4f5e-bd9b-b3406880ddd4_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8619f9ae-c590-4b39-b364-bf60415ec487","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"PDHC activity is reduced in patient fibroblast cell lines carrying PDHB variants and phenylbutyrate increased PDHC enzymatic activity.","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/dc965414-44dc-4e50-96d5-97fffc122ad2","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"The authors determined the PDHC activity and effect of phenylbutyrate in four fibroblast cell lines with PDHB variants including, p.M101V (hom), p.M101V; p.l266LfsX26 (CH), p.M101V (hom), and p.Y137C (hom).
