{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1499c473-fedf-482b-8c58-40bcacbab766v1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"The relationship between GTPBP3 and Leigh syndrome spectrum was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of January 13, 2020. The GTPBP3 gene encodes the GTP-binding protein 3 important for modification of the uridine at the wobble base of five mitochondrial transfer RNAs, which is critical for mitochondrial translation.\n\nThe GTPBP3 gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Leigh syndrome spectrum in 2014 (PMID: 25434004). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included five variants identified in three cases in one publication (PMID: 25434004). Loss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease association is also supported by biochemical function, functional alteration in non-patient cells, and model systems (PMIDs: 30459337, 29390138, 30916346, 27184967, 28732077).\n\nIn summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on January 13, 2020 (SOP Version 7).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1499c473-fedf-482b-8c58-40bcacbab766","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0d1b0a47-e62d-48dd-8e0d-f2b1aff014a7","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0d1b0a47-e62d-48dd-8e0d-f2b1aff014a7_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0d1b0a47-e62d-48dd-8e0d-f2b1aff014a7_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2020-02-12T20:32:56.857Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0d1b0a47-e62d-48dd-8e0d-f2b1aff014a7_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0d1b0a47-e62d-48dd-8e0d-f2b1aff014a7_seg_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7883dade-dd63-4e42-a83e-81cc6e0dfcdf_proband_segregation","type":"FamilyCosegregation","dc:description":"Not enough information to calculate a LOD score","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25434004","rdfs:label":"Family 3","family":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7883dade-dd63-4e42-a83e-81cc6e0dfcdf","type":"Family","rdfs:label":"Family 3","ethnicity":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/"},"member":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f99fa9ce-81e2-49fb-a6c4-cc46b51d55c3","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25434004","rdfs:label":"72425","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":3,"detectionMethod":"","firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"Individual #72425 was a girl born to unrelated parents.
