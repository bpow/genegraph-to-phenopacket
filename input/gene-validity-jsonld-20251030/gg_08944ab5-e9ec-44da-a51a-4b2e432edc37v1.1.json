{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/08944ab5-e9ec-44da-a51a-4b2e432edc37v1.1","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"*ADAR* was first suspected to be associated with autosomal dominant type 1 interferonopathy in 2003 when Zhang et al. (PMID: 12713580) identified the location of the gene via genome wide scanning and two point linkage analysis in two families with dyschromatosis symmetrica hereditaria. In 2009, Hartner et al. (PMID: 19060901) proposed the role of *ADAR* in type I interferon-inducible transcripts.  In 2012 Rice et al. (PMID: 23001123) described the role of *ADAR* in the suppression of type I interferon (IFN) signaling in autosomal dominant presentations of Aicardi–Goutières syndrome and the phenotype was expanded.\n\nThe described autosomal dominant *ADAR* phenotypes are considered forms of type 1 interferonopathy, which is defined as a condition in which increased type 1 interferon signaling leads to autoimmune and neurological disorders (MONDO:0700261). Therefore, the following disease entities have been lumped into one disease entity: Aicardi–Goutières syndrome, dyschromatosis symmetrica hereditaria (OMIM: 127400), and bilateral striatal necrosis (not listed on OMIM). The split curation for autosomal recessive *ADAR* and ADAR-related type 1 interferonopathy has been curated separately by the Brain Malformations GCEP. \n\nSeven variants reported in ten probands across six publications (PMIDs: 28561207, 25982145, 24262145, 37770123, 32911246, 18705826), including one publication of case-level segregation data (PMID: 12916015), are included in this curation. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss of function, however, some suggest that a specific ADAR variant, c.3019G>A (p.G1007R), confers a dominant negative effect (PMIDs: 19713932, 23001123, 28561207).  More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence including biochemical function, non-human model organism(s), and functional alteration in non-patient cells (PMIDs: 19060901, 38190734).\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *ADAR* and autosomal dominant *ADAR*-related type 1 interferonopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. \n\nThis classification was approved by the ClinGen Leukodystrophy and Leukoencephalopathy GCEP on the meeting date April 29th, 2024 (SOP Version 10).\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/08944ab5-e9ec-44da-a51a-4b2e432edc37","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c6e83262-29db-4535-a41b-8cb8549009bf","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":[{"id":"cg:sopChange"},{"id":"cg:summaryChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c6e83262-29db-4535-a41b-8cb8549009bf_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10107","date":"2024-10-21T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c6e83262-29db-4535-a41b-8cb8549009bf_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10107","date":"2024-10-21T23:48:04.574Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration","ErrorClarification"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c6e83262-29db-4535-a41b-8cb8549009bf_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/86f31800-a79a-4a21-b05e-f9e2a3f8ae38","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"expected NMD, exon 14/15 junction~3441","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/86f31800-a79a-4a21-b05e-f9e2a3f8ae38_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25982145","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ad88d0c3-f0a4-48f0-b753-737db6201e8d","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001111.5(ADAR):c.3363dup (p.Lys1122Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA915941440"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Heterozygous"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f43a819c-a191-4a84-8e8f-9bbcfcfeda36","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f43a819c-a191-4a84-8e8f-9bbcfcfeda36_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37770123","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2dd6ffc9-b69d-4c76-aded-6fa9c711ee86","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001111.5(ADAR):c.3247C>T (p.Arg1083Cys)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA342635396"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:DeNovoAlleleOrigin"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:Heterozygous"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7e85539a-2663-498a-874f-1b0641af342e","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"expected NMD, exon 14/15 junction~3441","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7e85539a-2663-498a-874f-1b0641af342e_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25982145","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fc821f2f-93c7-4a2f-9d73-3000d724fd9d","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001111.5(ADAR):c.2977G>T (p.Glu993Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA342636014"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Heterozygous"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c6e83262-29db-4535-a41b-8cb8549009bf_seg_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/82ab9556-59c5-4f28-94f9-1cea01e40ba2_proband_segregation","type":"FamilyCosegregation","dc:description":"To detect pathological mutations in the seven candidate genes, four affected individuals from each of pedigrees 1–3 and pedigree 4 (a fourth family with DSH added to the study, with 10 affected and 14 unaffected individuals) were screened by single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis (SSCP), which revealed mutant heteroduplexes made by hybridizing PCR fragments of the DSRAD [ADAR] gene.
