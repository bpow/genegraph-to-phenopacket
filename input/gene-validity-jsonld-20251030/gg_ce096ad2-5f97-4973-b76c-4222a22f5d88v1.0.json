The publication includes two affected adult siblings from a single family with sleep-related hypermotor epilepsy, intellectual disability, ataxia, and cerebellar hypoplasia. A single splice site variant has been reported in both siblings and was noted to result in skipping of exon 2 (the first coding exon), leading to reduced AChE (acetylcholinesterase) at the synapse causing acetylcholine accumulation and an enhanced cholinergic response (PMID: 26339676). There is currently no additional clinical or functional evidence available for *PRIMA1* in association with epilepsy.\n\nIn summary, there is limited evidence to support the relationship of *PRIMA1* to autosomal recessive epilepsy. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Epilepsy GCEP on January 7, 2025 (SOP Version 11).\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ce096ad2-5f97-4973-b76c-4222a22f5d88","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2247fe32-492c-4a1b-8e1c-5ee13bae944a","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2247fe32-492c-4a1b-8e1c-5ee13bae944a_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10005","date":"2025-01-07T18:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2247fe32-492c-4a1b-8e1c-5ee13bae944a_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10005","date":"2025-03-18T16:19:27.903Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2247fe32-492c-4a1b-8e1c-5ee13bae944a_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7178f27c-6a4a-41fc-97c0-ba328f014189_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/06c1c163-8037-49f5-8a27-166ddf1dbea9","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1.0,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/06c1c163-8037-49f5-8a27-166ddf1dbea9_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"Obtained a fresh blood sample from affected (II:3) and unaffected (II:1) sibs and generated lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) to check for mRNA expression. However, PRIMA1 expression was not detected in cell lines from either family member. Used a minigene assay to amplify wild-type and c.93+2T>C from the genomic DNA of unaffected and affected family members and cloned into a splicing-competent minigene vector. HEK293T cells were transfected with the minigenes and the vector. Cellular RNA was analyzed by RT-PCR and revealed incorporation of exon 2 in RNA produced by the wild-type minigene and skipping of exon 2 in RNA produced by the mutant minigene (Fig. 3). Results indicate the variant causes skipping the second exon (the first coding exon). The mutated splice site cannot be recognized, resulting in PRIMA1 deletion and reduced AChE at the synapse, which leads to acetylcholine accumulation and an enhanced cholinergic response.","functionalDataSupport":"Yes"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/06c1c163-8037-49f5-8a27-166ddf1dbea9_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26339676","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/aa443137-3f2f-40e2-8fbf-15200d888f83","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_178013.4(PRIMA1):c.93+2T>C","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA391146886"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":1.0},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7178f27c-6a4a-41fc-97c0-ba328f014189","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26339676","rdfs:label":"II:3","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":53,"allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/aa443137-3f2f-40e2-8fbf-15200d888f83"},"detectionMethod":"Performed linkage analysis with a fully penetrant recessive model using 7102 SNP markers generated from the exomes of four family members (both affected siblings, an unaffected sibling, and the father).
