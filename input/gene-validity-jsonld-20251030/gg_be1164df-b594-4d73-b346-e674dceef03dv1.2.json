Only one proband with a homozygous frameshift variant was scored. A second proband also carried the same homozygous frameshift variant, but both families originated from the same region of Eastern Algeria and were found to carry the variant on the same haplotype, so this individual was not scored. Segregation data was scored in Family 1, in which the variant was identified in a homozygous state in four affected siblings and in a heterozygous state in three unaffected siblings (PMID: 12459588). \n\nPrss12 knockout mice showed no differences in behavioral tests of long-term memory, but had altered social interaction compared to wild-type mice (PMID: 20092579). In addition, knockout mice had reduced hippocampal apical spine density, reduced phosphorylated CREB after behavioral stimulation, and reduced activity-dependent formation of dendritic filopodia in the hippocampus (PMIDs: 20092579,19303856). The evidence from knockout mouse models was not scored as there is very limited case data, so the implication for a human phenotype is currently unclear. \n\nIn summary, there is limited evidence to support the relationship between *PRSS12* and non-syndromic intellectual disability. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the Intellectual Disability and Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel on August 4, 2021 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/be1164df-b594-4d73-b346-e674dceef03d","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d98f99d6-b1df-4cad-a53b-c94cfb532167","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","changes":{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d98f99d6-b1df-4cad-a53b-c94cfb532167_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2023-08-31T21:20:24.706Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d98f99d6-b1df-4cad-a53b-c94cfb532167_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2021-08-04T06:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d98f99d6-b1df-4cad-a53b-c94cfb532167_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d98f99d6-b1df-4cad-a53b-c94cfb532167_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/332b87c0-5a5b-47b7-9788-0879c607bad7","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"PRSS12 is expressed during development of brain regions important for learning and memory (cortex and hippocampus), and immuno EM in adult human cortex showed localization of the protein in presynaptic vesicles near the presynaptic membrane.

Agrin is the only proteolytic target of neurotrypsin, and addition of released agrin fragment (agrin-22) to neurotripsin KO hippocampal slices rescued induction of filopodia in stimulated hippocampi (Fig. 5A-E). Neurotrypsin (PRSS12) may be important for LTP-associated generation of dendritic filopodia, a precuror of dendritic spines and synapses. Neurotrypsin-dependant cleavage of agrin (to produce the agrin-22 released fragment) may be essential for LTP-dependent dendritic filopodia induction.
