Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting guidelines, we found differences in molecular mechanism and inheritance pattern. Therefore, the following disease entities have been split into multiple disease entities: autosomal recessive nemaline myopathy (MONDO:0009725) and autosomal dominant nebulin-related myopathy (MONDO:1010152). The split curation for autosomal recessive nemaline myopathy has been previously curated.\n\n*NEB* was FIRST reported in relation to autosomal dominant nebulin-related myopathy (MONDO:1010152) in 2019 when Kiiski and colleagues described a three-generational non-sanguineous Finnish family affected with autosomal dominantly inherited distal nemaline/cap myopathy while harboring a large in-frame deletion spanning exons 14 to 89 of the NEB gene (PMID: 30679003). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. \n\nLarge in-frame deletions in this gene have been reported in at least twelve probands in two publications (PMID: 30679003, 33933294) and in one manuscript preprint (PMID: 39802796). This gene-disease relationship is supported by animal and non-human cell models, expression studies, and in vitro functional assays (PMID: 11309420, 12064939, 165157704, 20498015, 23375831, 23715323, 25110572). Bulk tissue gene expression data from the GTEx Portal indicates *NEB* is highly expressed in skeletal muscle (PMID: 23715323, dbGaP Accession phs000424.v10.p2). Two-hybrid screening and protein pull down assays show interactions with proteins having similar roles in maintenance of muscle structure and function and previously implicated in muscloskeletal system disorders (PMID: 11309420, 12064939, 25110572). RNAi knockdown of *NEB* in rat fetal myocytes corresponded to reduced nebulin levels and nonstriated appearance of thin filament components (PMID: 16157704). Nebulin heterozygous mice model studies showed slight reduction in muscle force (PMID: 23375831). Studies involving chick skeletal myocytes transfected with shorter version of human nebulin showed the synthetic mini-nebulin can undergo successful transcription and translation as well as stabilize actin filaments within the confines of their short length (PMID: 20498015). Similarly, Western blot analysis shows truncated nebulin isoforms present in affected patients with in-frame deletions in *NEB* (PMID: 30679003, 33933294).\n\nIn summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Congenital Myopathies Gene Curation Expert Panel on March 11, 2025 (SOP version 11).\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a95303a3-5804-47af-9d7f-2490bf6fc9a6","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8c47ca02-4d1a-492a-9836-d7db52a8af3d","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","changes":{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8c47ca02-4d1a-492a-9836-d7db52a8af3d_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10031","date":"2025-03-11T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8c47ca02-4d1a-492a-9836-d7db52a8af3d_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10031","date":"2025-09-22T13:16:28.531Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"Ten additional families with distal myopathy while harboring large in-frame deletions in the NEB gene were reported by Sagath et al. 2024 (PMID: 39802796, manuscript preprint).
