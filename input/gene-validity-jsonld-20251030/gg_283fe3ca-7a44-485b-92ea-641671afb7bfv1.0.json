Oguchi disease is an autosomal recessive form of congenital stationary night blindness. It is characterized by the Mizuo–Nakamura phenomenon, a gold coloration of the retina that disappears in the dark-adapted state and reappears shortly after light exposure. \nBiallelic variants in GRK1 were first reported in patients with Oguchi disease in 1997 (Yamamoto et al, PMID 9020843). Since then, over 20 variants associated with Oguchi disease have been reported in GRK1 (http://dna2.leeds.ac.uk/GRK1_LOVD/variants/GRK1/unique; Poulter et al, 2020, PMID 33252155).  The mechanism of disease is loss of function. The GRK1 gene product, rhodopsin kinase, phosphorylates photo-activated rhodopsin, which is then bound by arrestin (encoded by SAG, which is also implicated in Oguchi disease). This is important for quenching and recycling photo-activated rhodopsin. Without this function, photo-activated rhodopsin would continue to activate the phototransduction cascade and the rod photoreceptors would be unable to respond to light.\nIn this curation, data from 12 probands with 11 unique variants (nonsense, frameshift, missense), as well as segregation data from a large, consanguineous family from Pakistan, were collected from 4 publications (Yamamoto et al, 1997, PMID 9020843; Oishi et al, 2007, PMID 17765441; Azam et al, 2009, PMID 19753316; Poulter et al, 2020, PMID 33252155). More data is available in the literature but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached.\nThis gene-disease relationship is supported by the biochemical function of rhodopsin kinase, described above (Lorenz et al, 1991, PMID 1656454; Palczewski et al, 1993, PMID 8383684; Maeda et al, 2003, PMID 12742390; Métayé et al, 2005, PMID 15894165), expression of GRK1 in photoreceptor cells and low/no expression in other tissues (Lorenz et al, 1991, PMID 1656454; Zhao et al, 1998, PMID 9478965), functional alteration experiments showing the impact of altered GRK1 residues on the ability to phosphorylate rhodopsin (Huang et al, 2009, PMID 19364770), and the phenotype of a Grk1 null mouse (Chen et al, 1999, PMID 10097103).  \nIn summary, GRK1 is definitively associated with Oguchi disease. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This clinical validity classification was approved by the ClinGen Retina Gene Curation Expert Panel.\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/283fe3ca-7a44-485b-92ea-641671afb7bf","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b6e159cb-c02a-417c-9c60-a9b66db41c73","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b6e159cb-c02a-417c-9c60-a9b66db41c73_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10072","date":"2021-02-10T18:51:15.890Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b6e159cb-c02a-417c-9c60-a9b66db41c73_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10072","date":"2021-01-07T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b6e159cb-c02a-417c-9c60-a9b66db41c73_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5a6a24a8-69d4-4e80-a264-7ac335e2d6c2_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"This individual, with symptoms consistent with Oguchi disease, is homozygous for a missense variant in GRK1, p.Val380Phe.

RK catalytic activity was measured for the bovine RK mutant proteins generated. p.Arg191Ala, in the kinase domain (small lobe) had the most dramatic impact on RK activity with a decrease in kcat/Km of more than 1000-fold (Fig. 2, A and B, and Table 1). Arginine is invariant at this position in GRKs. Variants of structurally adjacent residues, p.Phe190Ala and p.Leu212Ala, also exhibited 10-fold decreases in catalytic efficiency. p.Tyr274Ala in the kinase domain (large lobe) and p.Val476Ala and p.Val484Ala (AGC kinase C-tail) showed 20–50-fold decreases in kcat/Km. Deletion of the first N-terminal 19 amino acids resulted in no measurable activity. The authors also found that conversion of residues in GRK1 that are important for receptor phosphorylation to their equivalents in other GRKs generated proteins with activity close to wild type. Variants equivalent to bGRK1-p.Arg191Ala were introduced into bGRK2 and hGRK6 (p.Arg195Ala and p.Arg190Ala, respectively) and substantially decreased values of kcat/Km compared to the normal sequence. Overall, the data suggested that the N-terminal region and a surface (identified by the residues shown to be important in this study) interact and stabilize the closed, active conformation of the kinase domain. Receptor binding was proposed to promote this interaction and therefore to enhance GRK activity.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19364770","rdfs:label":"Analysis of kinase domain variants in bovine RK"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b6e159cb-c02a-417c-9c60-a9b66db41c73_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c5f1f675-0f46-4ca9-9dfb-f7943dcb3720","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The score is increased because the function of RK is very well characterized and it is consistent with the features seen in individuals with Oguchi disease.

This result illustrates the function of RK, to phosphorylate photo-activated rhodopsin. This function is important for quenching and recycling photo-activated rhodopsin. Phosphorylated rhodopsin is bound by arrestin.
