These recessive disorders occur with high frequency among populations that have historically inhabited parts of the world where malaria is endemic. The inherited basis was first traced to partial or complete deletions in the *HBB* locus encoding the hemoglobin beta chain in 1975 (Ottolenghi et al., PMID: 49057), followed by the identification of specific HBB variants in two subsequent studies (PMID: 88735, PMID: 287080). Please note that earlier publications had previously identified the molecular basis of beta-thalassemia at the protein level through sequencing of the HBB gene product (PMID: 5863839, PMID: 6025643, PMID: 6038175). Individuals with biallelic *HBB* disruption are generally diagnosed with beta-thalassemia major or beta-thalassemia intermedia, depending on severity. Genotype is strongly correlated with phenotype, with higher severity associated with absence of detectable beta chains (beta-zero-thalassemia), and milder cases associated with the persistence of some detectable beta globin (beta-plus-thalassemia). Less severe forms of disease can also have milder anemia, due to moderately increased HbA2 hemoglobin and persistence of hemoglobin F, and reduced or no dependency on transfusions. The clinical and laboratory features of severely affected individuals include erythrocyte abnormalities such as hypochromic microcytic anemia, anisopoikilocytosis, elliptocytosis, decreased mean corpuscular volume, basophilic stippling, and dependence on blood transfusions with many disease phenotypes secondary to extramedullary hematopoiesis, e.g. splenomegaly and chronic transfusions resulting in iron overload. Characteristic abnormalities in hemoglobin itself include lack of beta-hemoglobin production, reduced hemoglobin A, increased HbA2 hemoglobin, and persistence of hemoglobin F later into childhood. Heterozygous carriers of causal variants are referred to as having beta-thalassemia minor or beta-thalassemia trait and can be mildly or sub-clinically affected. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping & Splitting Working Group, the molecular mechanism has been found to be consistent between cases harboring biallelic and monoallelic loss-of-function variants in *HBB*. However, the dramatic difference in phenotypic severity and penetrance between the biallelic and monoallelic cases distinguishes them as two different conditions rather than a single spectrum of disease. Therefore, cases of beta-thalassemia major or beta-thalassemia intermedia caused by biallelic *HBB* variants have been separately curated here for beta-thalassemia HBB/LCRB (MONDO:0013517). Cases of beta-thalassemia caused by dominant *HBB* variants in the heterozygous state have been found to cause disease through a different mechanism, and have been evaluated for dominant beta thalassemia (MONDO:0011381, MIM #603902) in a separate curation.\n\nTen suspected disease-causing variants have been scored as part of this curation (one missense, two nonsense, three frameshift, two disrupting splicing, one partial gene deletion, and one disrupting the first nucleotide of the 5’ UTR). These have been collectively reported in nine probands in four publications (PMID: 88735, PMID: 1581247, PMID: 287080, PMID: 3683554, PMID: 18196920, PMID: 12752111, PMID: 27263053). The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be biallelic loss of *HBB* function conferred by null and/or hypomorphic variants. Six out of nine probands were homozygous for their respective variants, while three probands were compound heterozygous. It has been established that the phenotype can also result from variants that disrupt a critical enhancer upstream of the *HBB* coding region (PMID: 1689188, PMID: 93487), although some of these variants disrupt the *HBD* locus as well. Evidence that the phenotype co-segregates with the homozygous genotype in a large family also contributed to the scoring of the gene-disease relationship (PMID: 18196920). A large amount of additional case-level evidence is available in the literature but was not included in this curation as the maximum score for this category of evidence had already been reached.\n\nThis gene-disease association is also supported by experimental evidence that the expression pattern of *HBB* across human tissues is highly restricted to the blood (PMID: 23715323). Extensive biochemical studies indicate that *HBB* encodes the beta chain of hemoglobin, which binds and releases oxygen as part of its function central to the role of red blood cells in carrying oxygen to the tissues of the body (PMID: 11747442). HBB protein interacts with the alpha hemoglobin chain encoded by the *HBA1* and *HBA2* genes (PMID: 6644819), which can harbor variants associated with the closely related condition alpha-thalassemia. Mouse models of *Hbb* loss of function recapitulate features of human beta-thalassemia patients such as hypochromic microcytic anemia, reduced hemoglobin A, abnormal erythrocyte morphology, splenomegaly, reticulocytosis, Heinz bodies, anisopoikilocytosis, presence of target cells, bone marrow hypercellularity, and abnormal iron deposition (PMID: 7568113, PMID: 9490703). CRISPR/Cas9-based editing of the mouse mutation in one case resulted in significant rescue of anemia, low hemoglobin concentration, anisocytosis and poikilocytosis, bone marrow proliferation, iron accumulation, and splenomegaly (PMID: 34706494).\n\nIn summary, *HBB* is definitively associated with autosomal recessive inheritance of beta-thalassemia. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both research and diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time without the emergence of contradictory evidence, leading to a Definitive classification. This classification was approved by the ClinGen General Gene Curation Expert Panel on April 26th, 2023 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/eadc4baf-54b0-4d3b-983e-34af2d397197","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/10e10aac-d9cc-4422-8fb9-b206e642bb27","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/10e10aac-d9cc-4422-8fb9-b206e642bb27_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10026","date":"2023-05-14T20:30:56.047Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/10e10aac-d9cc-4422-8fb9-b206e642bb27_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10026","date":"2023-04-26T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/10e10aac-d9cc-4422-8fb9-b206e642bb27_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fa0371bf-8301-40ff-84c6-92866421f92b_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6fa04c1f-6f2c-40d6-b142-b0ca140d844d","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"NM_000518.5(HBB):c.126_129del (p.Phe42LeufsTer19) is a deletion variant in exon 2 predicted to trigger a frameshift and nonsense-mediated decay or to at least truncate the C-terminal 69% of the protein product.
