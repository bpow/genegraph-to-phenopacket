The *COQ5* gene encodes coenzyme Q5, methyltransferase which is involved in mitochondrial ubiquinone (coenzyme Q10, CoQ10) biosynthesis. Coenzyme Q10 is critical for many processes in the cell, including in the mitochondrial respiratory chain transferring electrons from complexes I and II to complex III. CoQ10 deficiency is a multisystem primary mitochondrial disease characterized by variable clinical manifestations that include encephalopathy, seizures, movement disorder, hypotonia, nephrotic syndrome, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, muscle weakness, exercise intolerance, retinopathy and sensorineural hearing loss. Laboratory findings include reduced CoQ10 biosynthesis and reduced activity of mitochondrial complex I+II and I+III and II+III (PMID: 28125198). \nThree variants (1 large tandem duplication, 1 canonical splice-site, 1 missense) that have been reported in 2 probands in 2 publications (PMIDs: 29044765, 37599337) are included in this curation. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss of function. \n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence including the biochemical function of ubiquinone biosynthesis that is shared with other known genes in the disease of interest (PMIDs: 9083048, 33340416, 28125198), protein interaction with *COQ4* which is another ubiquinone biosynthesis gene that has a definitive classification for mitochondrial disease (PMID: 25152161), and a human rescue model where high-dose oral supplementation of CoQ10 was shown to improve the clinical manifestations and Q10 levels in patients with *COQ5*-related coenzyme Q10 deficiency (PMID: 29044765). \n\nIn summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Ataxia GCEP on the meeting date July 10, 2024 (SOP Version 10).\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/271c9a6f-55d2-4c5c-a546-37403a160610","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9b9c2846-d034-46f4-87ba-525bed7efe9c","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9b9c2846-d034-46f4-87ba-525bed7efe9c_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10155","date":"2024-09-11T16:26:19.134Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9b9c2846-d034-46f4-87ba-525bed7efe9c_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10155","date":"2024-07-10T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9b9c2846-d034-46f4-87ba-525bed7efe9c_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9b9c2846-d034-46f4-87ba-525bed7efe9c_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d3de13bc-ce57-41f4-95f2-045fc4353ca7","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Also supported by the genereviews paper (PMID: 28125198), which describes high-dose oral CoQ10 supplementation (ranging from 5 to 50 mg/kg/day) as a pharmocologic treatment.

Patients with coenzyme Q10 deficiency typically have heterogeneous clinical manifestations that progress if untreated and certain phenotypes such as severe neurologic and/or renal damage may be irreversible. Malicdan et al. reported clinical improvements in 3 patients with coenzyme Q10 deficiency who received high dose oral treatment of ubiquinol (15 mg/kg/d divided into 3 dosages) for 6 months. Clinical improvements included cognitive and behavioral features such as quicker response rates in conversation and  improved alertness. Additionally, leukocyte coenzyme Q10 levels increased above the normal range for all affected individuals after 3 months of treatment. A combination of these improvements resulted in significantly decreased ICARS scores (quantification of impairment due to cerebellar ataxia; out of 100, where higher scores indicate higher levels of impairment). However, the patients stopped treatment 2 weeks before the 6 month evaluation and, subsequently, there was a slight deterioration in scoring results (patient 1: −22, patient 2: −8, patient 3: −11).\n\nUbiquinol has also been administered via nasal spray in a patient with CoQ10 deficiency and was well-tolerated (PMID: 37599337). This patient showed gradual improvement in motor condition (improved muscle strength, the patient sits up on her own from a lying position, stands on her own, decreased ptosis), and CoQ10 levels normalized with treatment. However, she has not acquired the ability to walk and cognitive development remains at a low level.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29044765","rdfs:label":"CoQ10 Supplementation in Patients with CoQ5 Deficiency","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:PhenotypeRescue"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityHumanRescueCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9b9c2846-d034-46f4-87ba-525bed7efe9c_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/de7096c9-e8d3-4acd-aff4-ca56637b46ff","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"This is in agreement with Genereviews (PMID: 28125198) and was experimentally demonstrated in S. cerevisiae (PMID: 9083049).","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2663a4c7-2a41-4d1e-8198-bf68f4021832","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Ubiquinone biosynthesis protein COQ5 is a component of the coenzyme Q biosynthetic pathway.
