{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/408bd0f3-9a04-42e3-9b44-8d96ce357104v1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"*FOXC2* was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant lymphedema-distichiasis syndrome in 2000 (Fang et al., PMID: 11078474). This condition involves primary lymphedema of the lower extremities and distichiasis to various degrees. Prenatal features may include congenital heart disease, cleft palate, cystic hygroma, and nonimmune fetal hydrops. Twenty-one variants (nonsense, frameshift, and missense) that have been reported in at least 21 probands in nine publications (PMIDs: 11078474, 19394045, 21918810, 25252123, 29906362, 31974414, 20450314, 22349027, 11371511) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is reported to be loss of function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by animal models, expression studies, and *in vitro* functional assays (PMIDs: 12719382, 15322537, 27214551, 26389677, 15465483, 19398761). Foxc2 heterozygous knockout mouse models demonstrate a postnatal lymphatic and eyelash phenotype as well as dermal lymphatic hyperplasia, and a conditional Foxc2 knockout mouse model was shown to recapitulate the human lymphatic phenotype. In summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *FOXC2* and autosomal dominant lymphedema-distichiasis syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Prenatal GCEP on the meeting date September 26, 2023 (SOP Version 9). ","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/408bd0f3-9a04-42e3-9b44-8d96ce357104","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/757840b2-8b39-44d0-aff9-dd9983e77d0f","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/757840b2-8b39-44d0-aff9-dd9983e77d0f_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10106","date":"2024-01-24T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/757840b2-8b39-44d0-aff9-dd9983e77d0f_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10106","date":"2024-01-24T16:44:48.308Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/757840b2-8b39-44d0-aff9-dd9983e77d0f_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/757840b2-8b39-44d0-aff9-dd9983e77d0f_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/809016a0-5509-436e-bdf3-d2dfe0bd3f26","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Reduced score as the lymphatic phenotype is only described for mice with homozygous loss of FOXC2 in the lymphatic endothelium.
