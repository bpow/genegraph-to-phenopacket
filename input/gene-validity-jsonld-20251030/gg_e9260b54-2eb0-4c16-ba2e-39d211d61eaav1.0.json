In its active, GTP-bound state, *ARL6* recruits the BBSome complex to the primary cilium, which is required for trafficking membrane proteins essential for ciliary signaling and maintenance (PMID: 20603001, 20207729). Multiple independent reports have identified biallelic pathogenic variants in *ARL6* in patients with classic Bardet-Biedl (BBS) features such as retinal dystrophy, obesity, polydactyly, renal anomalies, and cognitive involvement. Based on the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group criteria, this disease presents on a spectrum from syndromic Bardet-Biedl syndrome 3 (BBS3; MONDO:0010832) to non-syndromic retinitis pigmentosa 55 (RP55; MONDO:0013312); these were lumped and curated under “ciliopathy” (MONDO:0005308) because of a shared molecular mechanism and overlapping phenotypes. The mechanism is biallelic loss-of-function, resulting in disrupted ciliary transport and subsequent pleiotropic phenotypes.\n\nThe gene-disease relationship is supported by genetic evidence (12/12 points) from multiple independent cohorts, including nonsense, frameshift, missense, and large deletion variants (PMIDs: 15258860, 15314642, 32361989, 31736247, 27486776). Segregation evidence includes a LOD score of 9.85 in a large Bedouin kindred with a homozygous nonsense variant (p.Arg122Ter) (PMIDs: 7987310, 15258860). The relationship is also supported by experimental evidence (6/6 points). Functional studies demonstrate that pathogenic missense variants are unstable and degraded by the proteasome (PMID: 19236846), and that *ARL6* modulates Wnt signaling (PMID: 20207729). A Bbs3-knockout mouse model recapitulates key BBS phenotypes including retinal degeneration and male infertility (PMID: 22139371). Furthermore, rescue experiments in zebrafish demonstrate that the systemic (BBS3) and eye-specific (BBS3L) isoforms have distinct functions that explain the syndromic versus non-syndromic presentations (PMID: 20333246).\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *ARL6* and autosomal recessive ciliopathies. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Kidney Cystic and Ciliopathy Disorders GCEP on July 14th, 2025  (SOP Version 11).\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e9260b54-2eb0-4c16-ba2e-39d211d61eaa","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9289028a-10d0-4d9a-aa17-13d13d91c732","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9289028a-10d0-4d9a-aa17-13d13d91c732_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10066","date":"2025-09-30T20:37:41.661Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9289028a-10d0-4d9a-aa17-13d13d91c732_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10066","date":"2025-07-14T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9289028a-10d0-4d9a-aa17-13d13d91c732_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7182ad24-fe75-419b-aa21-870e2a391550_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cd0aa586-9517-4dc9-865c-4762e1e93062","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"For homozygous predicted or proven null variants (without functional evidence), both observations of the variant in a case should be scored (2x 1.5 points), but downgraded by 0.5 points for homozygosity and by an additional 0.5 points unless consanguinity is explicitly ruled out.","calculatedScore":3.0,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cd0aa586-9517-4dc9-865c-4762e1e93062_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27486776","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a90d06c5-85e7-498f-b16c-669cb6a386cd","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NC_000003.12:g.97790061_97794169del","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA645372403"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7182ad24-fe75-419b-aa21-870e2a391550","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27486776","rdfs:label":"Lindstrand KK11-04","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":17,"allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a90d06c5-85e7-498f-b16c-669cb6a386cd"},"detectionMethod":"The investigators screened the patient cohort using a custom high-resolution array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) specifically designed to detect copy-number variants (CNVs) across 94 known ciliopathy and intraflagellar transport genes.
