It contains 14 exons and encodes a 929aa protein. It has been reported to play a role in regulation of cell death (PMID:15178406).\n\nVariants in *DSTYK* have been reported in individuals with the following disease entities: Congenital anomalies of kidney and urinary tract 1 (OMIM 610805) and Spastic paraplegia 23 (OMIM 270750). Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found a difference in molecular mechanism, inheritance pattern and phenotypic variability. Therefore, the clinical presentations have been split into the following disease entities: Congenital anomalies of kidney and urinary tract 1 (OMIM 610805), and complex spastic paraplegia. The following curation reports on variants related to complex spastic paraplegia. \n\n*DSTYK* was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive complex hereditary spastic paraplegia in 2017 (Lee et al., PMID: 28157540). However, reports of an autosomal recessive neurologic disorder characterized by childhood-onset spastic paraplegia resulting in gait difficulties and associated with pigmentary abnormalities, including premature graying of the hair and vitiligo-like or hyperpigmented skin lesions were first published in the 1980s (PMIDs: 7441281, 12868479, 6886718, 4061404, 6264350). The linkage interval of the disorder was subsequently defined to a 25-cM region on chromosome 1q24-q32 (Blumen et al. 2003 PMID:14681889).\n\nA single, homozygous, complex rearrangement identified in three unrelated consanguineous families (Lee et al. 2017, PMID: 28157540) is included in this curation. Functional data from patient fibroblasts, melanocytes and keratinocytes supports loss of protein expression. The mechanism for disease is therefore predicted to be loss of function (PMID 28157540). \n\nMicrosatellite marker analysis showed a shared haplotype in all three reported families, therefore the score for this variant was downgraded due to suspected founder effect.\n\nThis gene-disease relationship is supported by in vitro functional assays which demonstrate an increase in cell death following UV exposure in patient fibroblasts, melanocytes and keratinocytes (PMID: 28157540). This suggests a mechanism by which loss of function of *DSTYK* causes the pigmentation defect observed in all described affected individuals.\n\nIn summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged.\n\nThis classification was approved by the ClinGen Cerebral Palsy GCEP on the meeting date September 7, 2023 (SOP Version 9).\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/05705103-8a0b-4d74-a269-82240e4d3ca2","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bbac4423-e313-4694-a7ac-2005164ea832","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bbac4423-e313-4694-a7ac-2005164ea832_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10113","date":"2023-09-29T02:30:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bbac4423-e313-4694-a7ac-2005164ea832_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10113","date":"2023-09-29T01:11:10.665Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bbac4423-e313-4694-a7ac-2005164ea832_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bbac4423-e313-4694-a7ac-2005164ea832_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ee938870-845d-417b-8e4f-3f9a963dd216","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8a174af7-5fa8-4972-85b2-c1c43e1dc27e","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"cell death quantified by cell number, cleaved caspase-3 staining, and FACS analysis.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28157540","rdfs:label":"UV-induced apoptosis"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bbac4423-e313-4694-a7ac-2005164ea832_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/692e8022-0d2f-43a1-bb10-c3db7d73bb20_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c5466d05-a418-45a7-af70-572c3e4474d0","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":4,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c5466d05-a418-45a7-af70-572c3e4474d0_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"Immunofluorescence in skin samples from IV-5 using DSTYK antibodies shows absence of labeling. \ncompared to control subjects.
