At least 5 unique variants (4 missense variants and 1 single amino acid deletion in the highly conserved GFFKR sequence of the cytoplasmic domain) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 29 probands in 10 publications (PMIDs: 29090484, 24498605, 21454453, 9834222, 31119735, 31064749, 33276370, 32581362, 34355501, 36430862). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 27 additional family members. The mechanism for disease is thought to be heterozygous gain of function, or activating, mutations (PMIDs: 9834222, 21454453). Of note, this gene has also been implicated in autosomal recessive Glanzmann’s Thrombasthenia due to loss of function variants. This has been assessed separately. This gene-disease association is supported by its shared biochemical function (PMID: 6460044) and protein interaction with *ITG3B* (PMID: 6213621), and functional alteration in both patient (PMID: 29090484) and non-patient (PMID: 21454453) cells, indicating a defect in proplatelet formation. Additionally, a knock-in mouse model recapitulated the macrothrombocytopenia phenotype due to constuative activation (PMID: 31691484). In summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *ITGA2B* and autosomal dominant platelet-type bleeding disorder 16. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.\n\nThis gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the HT GCEP on 06/25/2021. It was reevaluated on 10/23/2023. As a result of this reevaluation 9 additional patients were identified (PMIDs: 32581362, 34355501, 36430862) and increased the classification from Moderate to Definitive (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/177ecff4-91e6-4202-aef9-127f91ba6df5","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/380c4fb9-aa51-4d34-9349-7938667612b7","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":[{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},{"id":"cg:sopChange"},{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"},{"id":"cg:newEvidence"},{"id":"cg:classificationChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/380c4fb9-aa51-4d34-9349-7938667612b7_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2023-11-06T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/380c4fb9-aa51-4d34-9349-7938667612b7_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2023-11-06T14:20:15.583Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["RecurationTiming","RecurationNewEvidence"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/380c4fb9-aa51-4d34-9349-7938667612b7_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/380c4fb9-aa51-4d34-9349-7938667612b7_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bd670c99-7594-416c-ba6c-5cfdd485d244","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Coprecipitation indicated the interaction between ITGA2B and ITGB3 proteins forming the αIIbβ3 complex on the platelet surface.
