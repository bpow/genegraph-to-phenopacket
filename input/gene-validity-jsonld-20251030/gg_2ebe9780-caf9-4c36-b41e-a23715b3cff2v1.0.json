Association is seen in one proband with a de novo heterozygous missense variant (Liu et al. 2016 27997596). Association was also made in at least 5 probands with missense variants by Yang et al. 2007 (17503324). These associations were subsequently disputed by Choi et al. 2009 (DOI 10.1002/humu.21098). This gene-disease association is supported by expression studies and protein interaction studies. Of note, this gene has also been implicated in hearing loss and renal tubular acidosis​. This been​ assessed separately. In summary, there is convincing evidence disputing the association between FOXI1 and autosomal recessive enlarged vestibular aqueduct syndrome. More evidence is needed to either support or refute the role FOXI1 plays in this disease. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hearing Loss Working Group on 2/27/18.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2ebe9780-caf9-4c36-b41e-a23715b3cff2","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d3a6b8fa-01d1-4f32-a45e-9c9582e14280","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d3a6b8fa-01d1-4f32-a45e-9c9582e14280_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2018-02-27T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d3a6b8fa-01d1-4f32-a45e-9c9582e14280_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"Cases reported by Yang et al 2007 were subsequently disputed.
