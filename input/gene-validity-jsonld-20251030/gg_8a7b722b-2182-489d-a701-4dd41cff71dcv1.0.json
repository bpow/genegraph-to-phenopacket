The MRPS34 gene encodes the mitochondrial ribosomal protein S34, a component of the small subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome.\n\nThe MRPS34 gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Leigh syndrome spectrum in 2017 (PMID: 29625026). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. \n\nThis curation included five unique variants identified in four unrelated cases from one publication (PMID: 28777931). No segregation data were available. Loss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease association is also supported by known biochemical function, expression data, functional alteration in patient cells, and animal models (PMIDs: 28777931, 25816300, 25613900).\n\nIn summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel December 9, 2019 (SOP Version 7).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8a7b722b-2182-489d-a701-4dd41cff71dc","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/41d20487-f150-41b6-947c-ce77e405e8de","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/41d20487-f150-41b6-947c-ce77e405e8de_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2020-09-16T19:23:36.441Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/41d20487-f150-41b6-947c-ce77e405e8de_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2020-08-27T16:22:59.700Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/41d20487-f150-41b6-947c-ce77e405e8de_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e19b00da-b60e-468f-b9dd-94fb7272fc90_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The homozygous variant identified in this individual is predicted to cause\nabnormal splicing by abolishing the donor splice site of\nexon 1.
