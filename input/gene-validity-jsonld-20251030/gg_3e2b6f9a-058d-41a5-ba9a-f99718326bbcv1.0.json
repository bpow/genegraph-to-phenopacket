Patient phenotypes are most often reported as ocular hypertension and open angle glaucoma, and can also include increased cup to disc ratio in the optic disc, abnormal trabecular meshwork morphology, and/or optic neuropathy.\n\nAt least 21 unique variants have been reported in human patients evaluated as part of this curation (19 missense, 1 in-frame indel, and 1 nonsense variant predicted to result in C-terminal truncation rather than nonsense-mediated decay). The variant types are consistent with the reported heterozygous gain of function mechanism. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 26 probands in 15 publications (PMIDs: 9005853, 23517641, 27080696, 11774072, 9328473, 94902876, 32300215, 9639450, 10815160, 11004290, 9556305, 9521427, 9772276, 9832047, and 9863594). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in over 25 additional family members. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence has already been reached.\n\nThe mechanism for disease has been experimentally shown to be heterozygous gain of function, with the mutant MYOC protein accumulating in the trabecular meshwork causing increased stress and early cellular apoptosis (PMID: 10545602). A fly model of the disease exhibits fluid discharge from overexpressed mutant or wildtype MYOC, which mirrors the human phenotype of increased intraocular pressure, and similarly causes rapid deterioration in visual function (PMID: 19148291). At the cellular level, the flies also exhibit the features of ER stress, unfolded protein response, and apoptosis thought to underlie the human disease state (PMID: 19148291). A mouse model expressing a human *MYOC* transgene exhibits accumulation of the mutant protein and increased stress in the trabecular meshwork, increased intraocular pressure, progressive retinal ganglion cell death, and optic nerve degeneration (PMID: 21821918). There is more evidence available in the literature, but the maximum score for experimental evidence has already been reached.\n\nIn summary, *MYOC* is definitively associated with autosomal dominant open-angle glaucoma. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time without the emergence of contradictory evidence. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Glaucoma and Neuro-Ophthalmology Gene Curation Expert Panel on February 17th, 2022 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3e2b6f9a-058d-41a5-ba9a-f99718326bbc","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fe5896cf-ec59-431e-bf95-02de61729269","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fe5896cf-ec59-431e-bf95-02de61729269_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10077","date":"2024-01-01T01:30:53.034Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fe5896cf-ec59-431e-bf95-02de61729269_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10077","date":"2022-02-17T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fe5896cf-ec59-431e-bf95-02de61729269_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fe5896cf-ec59-431e-bf95-02de61729269_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d2805cf9-4cb4-46aa-b523-78a9292cb2af","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"This model demonstrates mirroring of some important phenotypes of glaucoma in humans, however the difference between the Drosophilia physiology and our own makes direct comparison more difficult.
