{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0f6ba35c-d068-45e8-a583-4cf501b8d44av1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"The relationship between TARS2 and Leigh syndrome spectrum was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of May 24, 2021. The TARS2 gene encodes mitochondrial threonyl-tRNA synthetase 2, one of the mitochondrial aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, which function in mitochondrial translation by catalyzing the attachment of amino acids to their cognate tRNAs. Defects in tRNA charging can result in impaired synthesis of oxidative phosphorylation complex protein subunits. \n\nThe TARS2 gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Leigh syndrome spectrum in 2014 (PMID: 24827421). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included four variants in two cases in two publications (PMID: 24827421, 33153448). No segregation data were available. Loss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease association is also supported by known biochemical function and expression (PMIDs: 27977873, 25613900).\n \nIn summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on May 24, 2021 (SOP Version 7).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0f6ba35c-d068-45e8-a583-4cf501b8d44a","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/475a994f-8420-45bb-8f14-9fe85cdcdbbc","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/475a994f-8420-45bb-8f14-9fe85cdcdbbc_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2021-06-14T14:44:25.888Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/475a994f-8420-45bb-8f14-9fe85cdcdbbc_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2021-06-14T14:44:36.077Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/475a994f-8420-45bb-8f14-9fe85cdcdbbc_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/475a994f-8420-45bb-8f14-9fe85cdcdbbc_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1bcefa94-e14d-440b-9a23-b6bd317f410c","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"TARS2 shares similar function more than 10 genes known to cause Leigh syndrome (Score 2 pt per scoring rubric)\n","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0de1036c-92b4-46d3-9a97-892bf1c8b564","type":"Finding","dc:description":"The TARS2 gene encodes mitochondrial threonyl-tRNA (Thr-tRNA) synthetase, which is involved in mitochondrial translation (summary by Diodato et al., 2014).
