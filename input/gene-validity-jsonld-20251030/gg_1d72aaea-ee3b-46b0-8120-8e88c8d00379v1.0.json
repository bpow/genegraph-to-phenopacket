The same variant was also found in the unaffected mother and in the affected uncle, concluding incomplete penetrance. Evidence supporting this variant include the high conservation of the involved residue across different species and loss of function in an yeast complementation assay. Nevertheless, the mutation, p.Arg618His, is present in 2 out of 251488 alleles in GNOMAD suggesting it is benign. In addition, another amino acid substitution at the same position, p.Arg618Cys, is also present in 3 out of 251488 alleles on GNOMAD suggesting that in humans this amino acid is not well conserved.  Three other  variants have been reported in humans in relation to CMT (PMIDs 31356216,  24354524, 27717217, 27025386 , 29582526 ); one of them (PMIDs 31356216, p.Ala397Thr) was identified by exome sequencing in a 11 year old patient with diffuse motor neuropathy. Variant level evidence in this case include high conservation of the residue across different species and loss of function in an yeast complementation assay. Segregation of the mutation was limited to two family members and did not include the unaffected father. The other 2 reported variants, p.Pro800Thr and p.Arg737Trp,, have been observed in gnomAD  in the population of origin. Of note, biallelic mutations in this gene have been associated with interstitial lung and liver disease, but no clinical features of CMT have been reported in heterozygous carriers or homozygotes. Methionyl-tRNA-transferase belongs to the aminoacyl-tRNA transferase (ARS) family of enzymes. The mechanism by which MARS1 variants may cause CMT is unknown. The presumed haploinsufficiency mechanism in CMT, however, did not bear out in the homozygous patients with interstitial lung disease (PMID: 32833345). In summary, there is only limited to no evidence in support of this gene-disease relationship. ​We do not recommend the testing of this gene in the every-day clinical setting.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1d72aaea-ee3b-46b0-8120-8e88c8d00379","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8f042c42-893b-4c98-a719-0f778a54be43","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8f042c42-893b-4c98-a719-0f778a54be43_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10063","date":"2020-10-05T16:06:51.479Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8f042c42-893b-4c98-a719-0f778a54be43_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10063","date":"2020-10-05T16:07:07.257Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8f042c42-893b-4c98-a719-0f778a54be43_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8f042c42-893b-4c98-a719-0f778a54be43_ad_other_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a1ca5bab-c85f-47b9-897b-a12382f3ad38_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f6747387-40a6-4df3-9653-36357eafde77","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27717217","rdfs:label":"Hirano case","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":66,"detectionMethod":"\"extensive genetic analyses for 64 genes causative for CMT or other types of neuropathy (Zhao et al., 2012 Higuchi et al., 2016)\"","phenotypeFreeText":"onset with sole dysesthesia and occasional pain in a patient positive for anti-HCV antibodies and treated for hepatocellular carcinoma with radio wave; mild distal weakness in toe extension","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0012534","obo:HP_0002936","obo:HP_0012531","obo:HP_0009053"],"previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"PMP22 duplication and \"extensive genetic analyses for 64 genes causative for CMT or other types of neuropathy (Zhao et al., 2012 Higuchi et al., 2016)\"","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a1ca5bab-c85f-47b9-897b-a12382f3ad38_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27717217","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e22b3131-05b0-4a9a-966e-388df7bec51c","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_004990.4(MARS1):c.2398C>A (p.Pro800Thr)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA198548"}}}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/57195638-31b9-4dd9-bcf4-e2ec36bc86ac_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bb01417a-dbf4-4e72-a464-e3a6c528a499","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29582526","rdfs:label":"Sagi-Dain family, case III.2","ageType":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/","ageUnit":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/","detectionMethod":"","firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"initial diagnostic evaluation for presumptive CIDP; blood count, electrolyte, kidney and liver function, lipid and ceruloplasmin levels, ana and anti-double strand ab, c3, C4, heavy metal screening, anti-GM1 and GD1b, anti-MAG negative.
