Only this one homozygous missense variant with functional evidence to support pathogenicity has been reported in humans, with the phenotypes consisting of a distinctive fish-like odor, increased serum CK, muscle fatigue, and increased levels of N,N-dimethylglycine in urine. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes only this case-level data and biochemical function data which implicates the DMGDH mutant's decrease in choline metabolism as potentially causal for these phenotypes.\nIn summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship, particularly due to the lack of reported variants in humans. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship.This classification was approved by the ClinGen Aminoacidopathy Working Group on 06/28/19 (SOP Version 6). It was reevaluated on 10/14/2022 with no new evidence found. As a result of this reevaluation, the classification remains Limited.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f873561e-223a-40aa-97b4-0d682112f585","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b181250b-bc72-43b7-adec-5b85860b1a62","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","changes":[{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},{"id":"cg:sopChange"},{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b181250b-bc72-43b7-adec-5b85860b1a62_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10011","date":"2022-12-12T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b181250b-bc72-43b7-adec-5b85860b1a62_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10011","date":"2022-12-16T15:49:57.618Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b181250b-bc72-43b7-adec-5b85860b1a62_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b181250b-bc72-43b7-adec-5b85860b1a62_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d3417a14-4862-44a7-9e32-f525326dfadb","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"This biochemical evidence supports the abnormal choline metabolism being a cause for the main symptom of dimethylglycine dehydrogenase deficiency.

It is likely that either this compound or its excess degradation into the known cause trimethylamine is the root of the odor.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9398858","rdfs:label":"Choline Metabolism in FMO3 and DMGDH","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b181250b-bc72-43b7-adec-5b85860b1a62_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ed485f33-6780-46b9-96aa-61ecdd90c1bb_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ed485f33-6780-46b9-96aa-61ecdd90c1bb","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10102904","rdfs:label":"1","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":5,"allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7bca3152-ebbc-409b-b144-b79da547abfd","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_013391.3(DMGDH):c.326A>G (p.His109Arg)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/4742"}},"detectionMethod":"cDNA was prepared from the patient and control fibroblast cultures.
