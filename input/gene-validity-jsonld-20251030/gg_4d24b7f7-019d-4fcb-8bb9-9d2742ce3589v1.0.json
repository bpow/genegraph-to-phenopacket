Affected individuals are characterized by strabismus, delayed psychomotor development, seizures, delayed speech, hypsarrhythmia, and periventricular nodular heterotopia(PNH). The presumed mechanism of pathogenicity is loss of function. \n\nOne de novo missense mutation from one publication has been included in this curation (Conti et al., 2013 PMID: 24056535). Variant pathogenicity is supported by reduction of the mutant protein in comparison with wild-type. Immunocytochemistry reveals that, while in cells transfected with wild-type construct C6orf70 was distributed in a puncta-like pattern, transfection with the mutant construct generated a predominantly dispersed pattern of staining, suggesting that this mutation also alters the subcellular distribution of Ermard proteins. Statistical analysis revealed a significant switching from puncta-like to diffuse pattern of staining due to this variant. An additional proband submitted in ClinVar harboring a frameshift variant with PNH was included in this curation (SCV002012038.1, 3 Billion Internal data). A total of 1.1 genetic evidence points was reached. This gene disease relationship is also supported by expression and rescue in a non-human model organism (PMID: 24056535). \n\nConti et al., 2013 also identified 12 patients exhibiting abnormal brain development with periventricular nodular heterotopia, harbouring partially overlapping deletions of different extent in 6q25-qter and sharing a common 1.2 Mb minimal critical deletion in 6q27. Although these patients present with PNH, they were not included in this curation due to the multigene deletion. \n\nIn summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Brain Malformations expert panel on May 28th, 2024 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4d24b7f7-019d-4fcb-8bb9-9d2742ce3589","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9acacc58-f84e-4a2a-906c-8a35f58256c1","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9acacc58-f84e-4a2a-906c-8a35f58256c1_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10020","date":"2024-07-02T14:26:02.442Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9acacc58-f84e-4a2a-906c-8a35f58256c1_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10020","date":"2024-07-02T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9acacc58-f84e-4a2a-906c-8a35f58256c1_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0785b713-5b09-4d15-8db6-5e880fcb6a7f","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0785b713-5b09-4d15-8db6-5e880fcb6a7f_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"Western blot analysis revealed that the C6orf70 protein exists in human brain in two different isoforms (p.Ile250Asn-p.Ile207Asn).
