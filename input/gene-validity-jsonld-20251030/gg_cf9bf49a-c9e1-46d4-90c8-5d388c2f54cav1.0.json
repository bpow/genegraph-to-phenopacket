One missense variant in FGFR1 is associated with PS1, and has been reported in at least 16 probands from 8 publications (PMIDs: 10861678, 14564217, 7874169, 16957473, 25251565, 24127277, 23348274, 24776567). This gene-disease association is also supported by experimental evidence including animal models, and an in vitro functional assay (PMIDs: 21538817, 10942429, 14613973). In summary, FGFR1 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant Pfeiffer Syndrome Type I. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Craniofacial Malformations Gene Curation Expert Panel on 5/20/2021. \nGene Clinical Validity Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) – Version 8.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cf9bf49a-c9e1-46d4-90c8-5d388c2f54ca","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4fef65d0-f73c-45fe-968e-86073674cb7e","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4fef65d0-f73c-45fe-968e-86073674cb7e_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10059","date":"2021-05-21T22:44:53.081Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4fef65d0-f73c-45fe-968e-86073674cb7e_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10059","date":"2021-05-21T22:44:33.397Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4fef65d0-f73c-45fe-968e-86073674cb7e_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4fef65d0-f73c-45fe-968e-86073674cb7e_ad_other_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fec94e60-54e9-488d-b589-9cb19e610201_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"No patient specific phenotypes, no functional or radiographic evidence of variant impact.","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8d4a941e-cb23-4cb8-8547-fd449eb61790","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24127277","rdfs:label":"Roscioli FGFR1-PS Individual 1","detectionMethod":"PCR and Sanger of FGFR1 exon 7, FGFR2 exons 3, 5, 8, 10, 11, 14–17, FGFR3 exons 7, 10, and TWIST1.","firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypeFreeText":"No patient specific phens, clinically diagnosed with PS","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fec94e60-54e9-488d-b589-9cb19e610201_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24127277","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/608a8b26-aab2-4b87-bbba-1b0f94a34369","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_023110.2(FGFR1):c.755C>G (p.Pro252Arg)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA280217"}},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"none"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ba27ca67-f809-4a8c-890a-38fc2369afd6_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Phenotypic specificity and confidence in variant pathogenicity used to upgrade this case.","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f53ca314-93b4-47ee-8330-e8a7b836664d","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16957473","rdfs:label":"Hackett Family Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDiagnosis","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":2,"detectionMethod":"Lymphocyte analysis of proband, molecular analysis of proband and mother.
