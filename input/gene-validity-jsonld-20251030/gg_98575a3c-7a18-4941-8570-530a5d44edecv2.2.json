Evidence supporting this gene-disease curation includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data. Twelve unique variants (missense, nonsense, frameshift) have been reported in humans. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 10 probands in 7 publications. Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 8 additional family members. The gene disease relationship is supported by biochemical function experiments (PMID: 30171045). Of note, this gene has also been implicated in both *GNE* myopathy and sialuria, which are considered distinct from this isolated macrothrombocytopena. In summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship.\n\nThis gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the HT GCEP on 08/29/2020. It was reevaluated on 05/25/2022. As a result of this reevaluation, the classification was upgraded to Moderate with the addition of new case-level evidence (PMIDs: 33217855, 33198675, 34858435, 33637881, 35052006).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/98575a3c-7a18-4941-8570-530a5d44edec","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/335d18ae-50ef-49a8-abb2-79799833b544","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","changes":{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/335d18ae-50ef-49a8-abb2-79799833b544_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2023-09-14T16:38:38.707Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/335d18ae-50ef-49a8-abb2-79799833b544_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2022-05-25T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/335d18ae-50ef-49a8-abb2-79799833b544_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/335d18ae-50ef-49a8-abb2-79799833b544_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3ad38301-a66e-407a-981c-eae462cd0290","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2fa4c1ca-5a29-4aae-946e-7020a89b35c1","type":"Finding","dc:description":"UPD-N-acetylglucosamine-2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase (encoded by GNE), is a bifunctional enzyme that catalyzes the first two reactions in the sialylation pathway.
