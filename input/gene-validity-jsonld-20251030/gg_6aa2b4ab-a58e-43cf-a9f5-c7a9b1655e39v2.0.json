Two unique variants (frameshift, start-loss) reported in two probands in one publication are included in this curation (PMID: 28375157). One patient had numerous small liver cysts and 1 kidney cyst and the other had numerous small liver cysts and no kidney cysts. Additional clinical features were not provided. These heterozygous mutations in SEC61B lead to complete loss of function of the affected allele (PMID: 28375157). This gene-disease relationship is also supported by the related roles of ADPLD proteins and in vitro functional assays (PMID:28973524,28375157). In summary, there remains “Limited” evidence supporting the relationship between SEC61B and ADPLD. While more evidence is required to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged. This gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the Kidney Cystic and Ciliopathy GCEP on 06/10/2020 (SOP Version 7). It was re-evaluated on 08/23/2023 and the classification did not change (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6aa2b4ab-a58e-43cf-a9f5-c7a9b1655e39","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0fc2c7f6-caef-4f23-82ba-2360a5eb0990","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","changes":[{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},{"id":"cg:sopChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0fc2c7f6-caef-4f23-82ba-2360a5eb0990_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10066","date":"2023-08-23T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0fc2c7f6-caef-4f23-82ba-2360a5eb0990_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10066","date":"2023-10-11T14:58:11.693Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["RecurationTiming"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0fc2c7f6-caef-4f23-82ba-2360a5eb0990_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e0dabb3a-bb75-4624-8ee3-3039469c3f81","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"This variant is a start loss, which is higher impact than a missense and lower impact than a loss of function.","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e0dabb3a-bb75-4624-8ee3-3039469c3f81_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28375157","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/29340120-16c6-4622-b59e-29f72a14f1d1","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_006808.3(SEC61B):c.1A>G (p.Met1?)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA374234054"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:AlleleOrigin"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"No","zygosity":{"id":"cg:Heterozygous"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0fb02158-20a0-4432-94cb-f2d1e4feab42","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"This variant is a frameshift that leads to a termination codon in the last exon, likely escaping NMD and resulting in a protein that is only truncated by a few amino acids.","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0fb02158-20a0-4432-94cb-f2d1e4feab42_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28375157","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/32a671e3-2776-45e8-8570-60e2e11a4bb3","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_006808.3(SEC61B):c.106_107dup (p.Asn36LysfsTer42)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA658683546"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:AlleleOrigin"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"No","zygosity":{"id":"cg:Heterozygous"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0fc2c7f6-caef-4f23-82ba-2360a5eb0990_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0fc2c7f6-caef-4f23-82ba-2360a5eb0990_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/393f5410-ec19-4c49-b273-f13109243af6","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9ce6a101-807a-4922-8386-d3694be29897","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Tandem affinity proteomics was used to determine the interactome for SEC63.
