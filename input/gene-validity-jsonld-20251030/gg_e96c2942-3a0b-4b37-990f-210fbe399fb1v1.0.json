Loss of function of the MMAB gene product, ATP:cob(I)alamin adenosyltransferase (ATR), has been reported to methylmalonic aciduria (MMA), CblB type, based on complementation studies. The severe, early-onset form of this condition presents with neonatal ketoacidosis, lethargy, failure to thrive and encephalopathy. Patients with a milder form are usually diagnosed during infancy and have less severe neurological symptoms (Brasil et al, 2015). While patients with MMA due to variants in MMAA (type CblA) are responsive to Vitamin B12, only rare individuals with type CblB are responsive to treatment with Vitamin B12 (Hörster, et al, 2007, PMID 17597648; Manoli et al, 2016, PMID 20301409). \nBiallelic variants in MMAB were first reported in humans with methylmalonic aciduria, cblB type, in 2002 (Dobson et al, PMID 12471062). Since then, over 30 different variants have been associated with the condition (Brasil et al, 2015, PMID 24813872; https://databases.lovd.nl/shared/variants/MMAB/unique ).\nEvidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level and experimental data. Ten unique variants (nonsense, frameshift, splice site, missense) from 8 probands from 3 publications were curated (Dobson et al, 2002, PMID 12471062; Lerner-Ellis et al, 2006, PMID 16410054; Brasil et al, 2015, PMID 24813872). Further evidence is available in the literature but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached.\nThe gene-disease relationship is also supported by the biochemical function of ATR, which converts reduced cob(I)alamin to adenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl), the cofactor of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (MUT) (Leal et al, 2003, PMID 12514191; Yamanishi et al, 2005, PMID 15950874; Mera and Escalante-Semerena, 2010, PMID 20677021). MUT catalyzes the reversible rearrangement of methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA during the catabolism of branched-chain amino acids, odd-chain fatty acids and cholesterol. Lack of AdoCbl is therefore expected to result in reduced MUT activity, and methylmalonic acidemia. Of note, other defects in cobalamin metabolism can affect the activity of methionine synthase in addition to MUT, thus causing both homocystinuria and MMA. The relationship between MMAB and MMA is also supported by functional alteration studies. Mutagenesis of human MMAB and expression of the variants in a bacterial system revealed missense variants that reduce ATR activity and AdoCbl binding (Fan and Bobik, 2008, PMID, 18251506). In summary, MMAB is definitively associated with methylmalonic aciduria, cblB type.. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.\n\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e96c2942-3a0b-4b37-990f-210fbe399fb1","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/52b61ff5-afba-4ff7-adbc-51de6a837db7","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/52b61ff5-afba-4ff7-adbc-51de6a837db7_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10011","date":"2022-07-13T17:40:13.116Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/52b61ff5-afba-4ff7-adbc-51de6a837db7_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10011","date":"2022-07-13T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/52b61ff5-afba-4ff7-adbc-51de6a837db7_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/52b61ff5-afba-4ff7-adbc-51de6a837db7_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a2c8d153-4b85-4003-bf99-0fed8e021820","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The score is increased due to the number of variants analyzed, and the multiple studies showing decreased ATR activity and decreased cobalamin binding.","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a87b0961-d486-4770-8de1-5f92d23b556b","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Human MMAB cDNA (encoding ATP:cob(I)alamin adenosyltransferase; hATR) was randomly mutagenized using an E. coli mutator strain, the variants were expressed in Salmonella, and the hATR activity was measured. Fifty-seven nucleotide substitutions resulting in 32 different missense variants (two each at K78 and G97) were found to reduce ART activity based on the results of an indicator medium screen; five of the aletered amino acids had been previously shown to be altered in MMA patients. Eleven variants had an increased level ATR activity at 1500 nM compared to 150 nM OH-Cbl. Of these 30 altered amino acid residues, G63 and K78 directly contact MgATP in the structural model, and residues D64, R76, S126, R215, D218, and R225 are at the surface of the proposed active site pocket in position to interact with MgATP or cobalamin.\nBased on Western blot analysis, C119Y, R186W, C189Y, R190C, and R191W were unstable.\nExpression of hATR in ATR-deficient Salmonella restored AdoCbl-dependent growth on 1,2-Propanediol (1,2-PD). None of the hATR missense mutants enhanced the growth of ATR-deficient Salmonella on 1,2-PD, except for T161I which was capable of slow growth. These results indicate that the 32 hATR missense mutants had little to no ATR activity in vivo.
