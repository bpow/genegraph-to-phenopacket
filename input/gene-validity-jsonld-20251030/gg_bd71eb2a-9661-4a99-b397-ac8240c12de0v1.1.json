At least 6 loss of function variants have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, case-control data and experimental data.\n\nSummary of case level data: 3 points.\nVariants in this gene have been reported in at least 2 probands with a predicted or proven null variant (PMID: 31980491). Variants in this gene segregated with the disease in 2 additional family members with PAH.\n\nSummary of Case-Control Data: 3.5 points\nThis gene-disease relationship has been studied in at least 1 case control study at the aggregate variant level. (PMID29650961).  Protein truncating variants were reported in 4 out of 838 PAH cases versus 0 in 6385 controls. Both the case and the control group were analysed using whole genome sequencing. \nThe gene-disease association is supported by animal models and expression studies. \nIn summary, there is strong evidence to support the relationship between KDR and autosomal dominant pulmonary arterial hypertension. Three years must elapse from the first proposal of the association to reach a definitive classification.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bd71eb2a-9661-4a99-b397-ac8240c12de0","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/07a11f06-0904-4a38-9fd3-0aec2bece699","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":{"id":"cg:classificationChange"},"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/07a11f06-0904-4a38-9fd3-0aec2bece699_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10071","date":"2021-05-12T16:56:01.478Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/07a11f06-0904-4a38-9fd3-0aec2bece699_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10071","date":"2021-05-12T16:57:21.184Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/07a11f06-0904-4a38-9fd3-0aec2bece699_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/07a11f06-0904-4a38-9fd3-0aec2bece699_cc_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9f36f721-0dca-431c-ae90-8ff71c407b23","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9f36f721-0dca-431c-ae90-8ff71c407b23_cc_evidence_item","type":"Finding","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29650961","rdfs:label":"NIHR BR-RD dataset","caseCohort":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6a6f1d2c-6c0c-4263-a1b2-8635b31495b1","type":"Cohort","allGenotypedSequenced":838,"alleleFrequency":0.00477326968973747,"detectionMethod":"DNA extracted from venous blood underwent\nwhole-genome sequencing using the Illumina TruSeq DNA PCR-Free Sample\nPreparation kit (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) and Illumina HiSeq 2000 or\nHiSeq X sequencer, generating 100–150 bp reads with a minimum coverage of 15×\nfor ~95% of the genome (mean coverage of 35×).
