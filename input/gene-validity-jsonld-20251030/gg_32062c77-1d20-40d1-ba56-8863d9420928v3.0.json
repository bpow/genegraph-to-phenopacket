At least four unique variants (3 missense and 1 intronic) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least three probands in three publications (PMIDs: 18451993, 23268370, 25102815). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in two additional family members. This gene-disease relationship is supported by its biochemical function in the release of arachidonic acid (PMID: 3143418), functional alteration in both patient (PMID: 26183771) and non-patient cells (PMID: 21247147), and a mouse model (PMID: 12163563). In summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged.\n\nThis gene-disease pair was orginally evaluated by the HT GCEP on 03/25/2020 and reevaluated on 06/22/2022. It was again reevaluated on 10/21/2024 and as a result of this reevaluation the classification did not change as no new information is contributing to the classification.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/32062c77-1d20-40d1-ba56-8863d9420928","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ff7f6f85-cca7-4eb2-9957-9023c94402f0","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","changes":[{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},{"id":"cg:sopChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ff7f6f85-cca7-4eb2-9957-9023c94402f0_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2024-11-05T13:33:06.604Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ff7f6f85-cca7-4eb2-9957-9023c94402f0_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2024-11-04T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["RecurationTiming"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ff7f6f85-cca7-4eb2-9957-9023c94402f0_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ff7f6f85-cca7-4eb2-9957-9023c94402f0_seg_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/db2b8b60-2396-4d87-9ab1-d2425251de7b_proband_segregation","type":"FamilyCosegregation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25102815","rdfs:label":"Faioni Family","estimatedLodScore":0.73,"family":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/db2b8b60-2396-4d87-9ab1-d2425251de7b","type":"Family","rdfs:label":"Faioni Family","member":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/46f4a40d-65d6-4431-8590-957f7a353d36","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25102815","rdfs:label":"Male Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":2,"allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/900ca619-6122-4723-a336-1b33f9bd49a7","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_024420.3(PLA2G4A):c.1723G>C (p.Asp575His)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/624621"}},"detectionMethod":"All 18 exons were PCR amplified and products were Sanger sequenced.","firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypeFreeText":"slightly reduced factor IX, post-surgery hemorrhage, mildly reduced renal function","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0008320","obo:HP_0008148","obo:HP_0001892","obo:HP_0000421","obo:HP_0002239","obo:HP_0002588","obo:HP_0000225","obo:HP_0000790"],"secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/894e3bdd-9cac-42f9-b106-20b1ea390362_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25102815","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/900ca619-6122-4723-a336-1b33f9bd49a7"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:AlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"}}}},"meetsInclusionCriteria":false,"phenotypeFreeText":"slightly reduced factor IX","phenotypeNegativeAlleleNegative":1,"phenotypePositiveAllelePositive":2,"phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001892","obo:HP_0008148","obo:HP_0008320","obo:HP_0000225","obo:HP_0002588","obo:HP_0002239","obo:HP_0000790"],"proband":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/46f4a40d-65d6-4431-8590-957f7a353d36"}},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/dd4aa42c-f37d-4ead-97a2-ade9aa418d7c_proband_segregation","type":"FamilyCosegregation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23268370","rdfs:label":"Brooke Family","estimatedLodScore":0.73,"family":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/dd4aa42c-f37d-4ead-97a2-ade9aa418d7c","type":"Family","rdfs:label":"Brooke Family","member":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/42b7a637-e439-4cfa-b68e-88bb91ac310e","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23268370","rdfs:label":"Patient B","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":4,"allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9993f1cb-a67f-4289-bbd2-6e042158e67a","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_024420.3(PLA2G4A):c.2118+4_2118+7del","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/624622"}},"detectionMethod":"Whole-genome SNP array analysis was performed in both affected siblings to identify shared regions of homozygosity and in tandem, whole exome sequencing was performed in the affected female.
