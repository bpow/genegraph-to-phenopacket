IGHM encodes Igμ, which is part of the pre-B-cell antigen receptor complex, that promotes the generation and expansion of a population of large pre-B cells. Agammaglobulinemia 1 is a primary immunodeficiency characterized by profoundly low or absent serum immunoglobulins and low or absent circulating B-cells due to an early block of B-cell development. Affected individuals are susceptible to recurrent infections. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data. The mechanism of disease is homozygous loss of function and at least 20 unique variants have been reported in humans, including nonsense, frameshift, and splicing as well as large deletions. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 9 probands in 5 publications (PMIDs: 8890099, 26910880, 31696364, 12370281, 17410177), and segregated with disease in four additional family members. Additional evidence is available in the literature but the maximum of 12pt for genetic evidence has been reached. Experimentally, this gene-disease relationship is supported by its role in B cell development (PMID: 24378843), which is altered in patient cells (PMID: 11560957). In summary IGHM is definitively associated with autosomal recessive agammaglobulinemia 1. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4b2f80ce-3b30-45e7-8ed0-2540f6853755","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/51719b80-54fb-4a55-a63c-7d7a943da1e3","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/51719b80-54fb-4a55-a63c-7d7a943da1e3_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10080","date":"2021-06-15T12:08:22.194Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/51719b80-54fb-4a55-a63c-7d7a943da1e3_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10080","date":"2021-06-15T12:06:59.636Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/51719b80-54fb-4a55-a63c-7d7a943da1e3_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/51719b80-54fb-4a55-a63c-7d7a943da1e3_seg_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f3eb815e-ba99-41ab-b38c-0b562cc3d709_proband_segregation","type":"FamilyCosegregation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31696364","rdfs:label":"K2","estimatedLodScore":0.6,"family":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f3eb815e-ba99-41ab-b38c-0b562cc3d709","type":"Family","rdfs:label":"K2","member":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b89606b7-ce0a-4c9a-bd20-1fb98f051d83","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31696364","rdfs:label":"P2","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":6,"detectionMethod":"Genomic

homozygous point mutation identified in this family occurs at the -1 position of an alternative splice donor site used to produce the membrane rather than secretory mu transcript. A mutation at this critical site would be expected to have 3 effects: first, a substitution of serine for glycine in the secreted form of the mu chain, second in the membrane form of the mu chain a lysine would be substituted for glutamic acid, and finally the altered splice site would lead to an absence of the membrane form of the mu heavy chain. Experimental evidence was not provided provided to show a deleterious result of any of these effects.","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d46bf509-9362-4645-8f4a-bbf82246904d"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.25},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/170f932a-14b5-4a7a-9ee6-e8bc566ce956_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The homozygous nonsense variant Ser19Ter creates a stop codon in exon 1 of 6 and is predicted to result in NMD.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b0cc8f21-f4a2-4e90-87d3-f7d07538ffbb","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26910880","rdfs:label":"F31","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":2,"detectionMethod":"DNA was amplified by PCR and fragments were sequenced using BigDye Terminator v1.1 cycle sequencing kit.","firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypeFreeText":"IgG 0 mg/dl, IgA 0 mg/dl, IgM 5 mg/dl, B-cells <1%, white blood cells 14,600 cells/ml, paralysis after oral polio vaccination","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0004432","obo:HP_0002788","obo:HP_0003477","obo:HP_0032894"],"previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"DNA samples were analyzed for mutations in genes causing autosomal recessive agammaglobulinemia (CD79A, CD79B, IGHM, and IGLL1).\n","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/170f932a-14b5-4a7a-9ee6-e8bc566ce956_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26910880","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/abfa8fdf-30e4-4166-aac0-fb94347d491c","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NC_000014.9:g.105856163G>T (GRCh38)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA1139771381"}},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"none"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7a3bd11e-5f57-4168-a4a7-8463958fbc2e_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The homozygous frameshift variant Glu186ArgfsTer19 occurs in exon 2 of 6 and is predicted to result in NMD.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b89606b7-ce0a-4c9a-bd20-1fb98f051d83"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/51719b80-54fb-4a55-a63c-7d7a943da1e3_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/51719b80-54fb-4a55-a63c-7d7a943da1e3_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9ec3ae8b-1172-4a32-906a-907c07849b0e","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Igμ expression is not required for secondary V(D)J recombination in pro-B cells.
