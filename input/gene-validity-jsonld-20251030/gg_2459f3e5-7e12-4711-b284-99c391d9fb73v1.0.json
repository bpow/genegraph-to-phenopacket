This gene-disease relationship in the literature reports both autosomal dominant and recessive cases, so the mode of inheritance is currently undetermined. Four unique variants (1 homozygous missense, 3 heterozygous missense) that have been reported in four probands with CHD in three publications are included in this curation (PMID: 28991257, 33064175, 35885997). However, these variants were not scored due to a high minor allele frequency in gnomAD v.4 or a low REVEL score. This gene-disease relationship is supported by expression data in mouse cardiac tissues (PMID: 18816857). In summary, the evidence supporting the relationship between *COL1A2* and congenital heart disease has been disputed, and no valid evidence remains to support the claim. More evidence is needed to either support or entirely refute the role *COL1A2* plays in this disease. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Congenital Heart Disease GCEP on the meeting date September 9th, 2024 (SOP Version 11).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2459f3e5-7e12-4711-b284-99c391d9fb73","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b4e87080-7e90-4e19-a3dc-e986bfd01e0f","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"NoKnownDiseaseRelationship","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b4e87080-7e90-4e19-a3dc-e986bfd01e0f_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10130","date":"2024-09-09T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b4e87080-7e90-4e19-a3dc-e986bfd01e0f_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10130","date":"2024-10-07T20:14:38.172Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"There are papers implicating the gene in the disease but the genetic evidence could not be scored, so the EP classified it as Disputed.
