{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d4f7d359-2d5c-4eda-932b-029e330a8a34v1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"The relationship between MECR and Leigh syndrome spectrum was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of April 14, 2021. The MECR gene encodes mitochondrial trans-2-enoyl-coenzyme A-reductase which catalyzes the last step of the mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis pathway which is critical for normal function of the mitochondrial respiratory chain and several other mitochondrial enzyme complexes.\n\nThe MECR gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Leigh syndrome spectrum in 2016 (PMID: 27817865). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included five unique variants identified in three cases from one publication (PMID: 27817865). No segregation data were available. Loss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease association is also supported by known biochemical function, expression, and animal models (PMIDs: 27977873, 25613900, 30266742).\n\nIn summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on April 14, 2021 (SOP Version 7).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d4f7d359-2d5c-4eda-932b-029e330a8a34","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/75fcef99-f3fe-43b3-a544-a91f04ed1285","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/75fcef99-f3fe-43b3-a544-a91f04ed1285_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2021-06-14T14:25:34.349Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/75fcef99-f3fe-43b3-a544-a91f04ed1285_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2021-06-14T14:25:44.938Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/75fcef99-f3fe-43b3-a544-a91f04ed1285_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/11889196-4df1-403c-9346-7c62ae78db4f_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"one of the mutations is intronic","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/73d4f767-9ede-4dd6-b969-6185ec4e184a","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27817865","rdfs:label":"Family B II:2","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":27,"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"bilateral hyperintense pallidal T2 signal; A statistically significant reduction of the ETS (electron transport system) maximum capacity is seen in affected individuals 1 and 2 cell lines (family A, II:1, and family B, II:2, respectively)","phenotypes":"obo:HP_0001270","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/11889196-4df1-403c-9346-7c62ae78db4f_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27817865","allele":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/802c918a-b42f-44a2-87e0-ba6a513a9779","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_016011.5(MECR):c.695G>A (p.Gly232Glu)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA725727"}},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9dfe6a19-80a3-4f75-b542-72e292ab7322","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_016011.5(MECR):c.830+2dup","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA725650"}}],"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"none"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/497d1267-3b4e-4e93-a81f-42b9192b700c_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0fb9a36a-e4c6-45f5-b1ce-fe782d0a43bf","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27817865","rdfs:label":"Patient II:1 (Family E)","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":16,"detectionMethod":"Whole Genome Sequencing","firstTestingMethod":"Other","phenotypeFreeText":"Serial cranial MRI scans demonstrated bilateral areas of hyperintense T2 signal in the globi pallidi\nat 4y, with a subsequent cavitation in the left pallidum by 6 years (Figure 2E,F), and no significant\nchange at 10y.
