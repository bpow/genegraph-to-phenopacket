{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/22569e7d-88ea-4492-966d-c41b3f60444fv1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"The relationship between *COX6A2* and primary mitochondrial disease was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of March 18, 2024. The *COX6A2* gene encodes an isoform of a subunit of cytochrome *c* oxidase (COX) that is expressed in skeletal muscle and heart.\n\nThe first and only report of variants in *COX6A2* in relation to autosomal recessive primary mitochondrial disease was in 2019 (PMID: 31155743), in two probands with congenital myopathy and cardiomyopathy. Complex IV staining was uniformly weak on muscle histology and complex IV deficiency was seen on respiratory chain analyses in muscle and fibroblasts. While various names have been given to the constellation of features seen in those with *COX6A2*-related disorders, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *COX6A2* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework. \n\nEvidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included two missense variants (PMID: 31155743).\n\nThe mechanism of disease is loss of function This gene-disease association is also supported by the known biochemical function of COX6A2 as a subunit of complex IV and several *COX6A2* knockout mouse model studies showing similar biochemical phenotypes to those seen in affected individuals (PMIDs: 31155743, 11788423, 23460811).  \n\nIn summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on March 18, 2024 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/22569e7d-88ea-4492-966d-c41b3f60444f","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c09fbc40-dc5e-4cbd-80d1-1f918fffdceb","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c09fbc40-dc5e-4cbd-80d1-1f918fffdceb_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2024-03-18T04:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c09fbc40-dc5e-4cbd-80d1-1f918fffdceb_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2025-01-14T18:05:10.153Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c09fbc40-dc5e-4cbd-80d1-1f918fffdceb_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c09fbc40-dc5e-4cbd-80d1-1f918fffdceb_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/004d9edc-128b-4f45-afbc-edeb235baaf4","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Score 0.5 for mild cardiac phenotype in mice with biochemical abnormalities ","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/671514ff-c546-465e-9e7d-d40f46b3e88c","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Cardiac phenotype is milder than that reported in single human case, but is present and complex IV abnormalities are seen in heart tissue (by BN PAGE on spectrophotometry) \n\nHowever, total myocardial ATP was not significantly different in wild-type and mutant mice","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11788423","rdfs:label":"Cardiac Phenotype of Cox6a2-/-","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2ed068d7-dd86-4cbd-82b6-554a97a94140","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Score 1 point for strong biochemical overlap without phenotypic description of mice","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/db69a35e-90af-4f0b-b23a-1e8e95dba640","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Mice muscle tissue shows uniformly distributed faint COX staining similar to patients and significant (and isolted) reduction of complex IV activity by spectrophotometry, and marked reduction in IV and IV containing super complexes where I, II, III were normal by BN PAGE.

The specific force production (force/cross-sectional area) of soleus and extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles (Fig. 7A), as well as the grip strength (Fig. 7B) were similar between WT and Cox6a2 −/− mice. However, in a fatiguing protocol, isolated soleus muscle of Cox6a2 −/− mice was more resistant to fatigue and recovered much faster as compared to WT muscle (Fig. 7D), which is consistent with an increase in oxidative muscle fibers. However, this was not reflected at the level of the whole animal since we observed that in an endurance experiment Cox6a2 −/− mice had decreased exercise capacity as compared to WT mice when running uphill. When mice were forced to run downhill there was no significant difference in performance, although there was again a tendency towards reduced performance in Cox6a2 −/− mice (Fig. 7C). We ascribe this discrepancy between the in vitro and in vivo muscle performance to the cardiac phenotype of these mice (i.e. diastolic dysfunction), which is only observed under high workloads [30]. Finally, despite the loss of COX6A2 expression, ATP levels within the skeletal muscles of Cox6a2 −/− and WT mice were similar (Fig. 7E), which is consistent with previous observations in the heart [30]. Thus, Cox6a2 −/− mice have developed compensatory mechanisms that allow production of sufficient amounts of ATP to perform mechanical work.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23460811","rdfs:label":"Mouse Model of Cox6a2-/-
