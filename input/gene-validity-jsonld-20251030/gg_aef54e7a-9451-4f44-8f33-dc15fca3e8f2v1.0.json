More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is reported to be loss-of-function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence (interaction, biochemical functional, and functional alteration evidence, as well as a mouse model; PMIDs: 12627228, 16525474, 16813530, 18296023). OSTM1 interacts with CLCN7 by co-localizing and assembling into a structure that includes both proteins. CLCN7 has been classified as definitive for both autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive osteopetrosis by the Skeletal Disorders GCEP. Biochemical functional and functional alteration evidence show that OSTM1 is necessary in signaling processes associated with bone development. The mouse model shows that mutant mice have osteoporosis, early lethality, and brain anomalies, just like affected humans. In summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *OSTM1* and autosomal recessive osteopetrosis. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Skeletal Disorders GCEP on the meeting date June 10th, 2024 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/aef54e7a-9451-4f44-8f33-dc15fca3e8f2","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/25959d42-dae2-47e8-a14c-4fcbd7540491","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/25959d42-dae2-47e8-a14c-4fcbd7540491_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10065","date":"2024-07-08T14:42:45.594Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/25959d42-dae2-47e8-a14c-4fcbd7540491_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10065","date":"2024-06-10T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/25959d42-dae2-47e8-a14c-4fcbd7540491_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/25959d42-dae2-47e8-a14c-4fcbd7540491_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8b6c4bca-4c7c-47a9-956e-80a92c0cd6fe","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ccdbf07a-8e58-4771-843e-40a9c2b6496d","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Mutant mice exhibit osteopetrosis and neonatal lethality, just like affected humans.
