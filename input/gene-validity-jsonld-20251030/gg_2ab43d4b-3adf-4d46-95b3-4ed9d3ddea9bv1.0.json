At least three unique variants (1 missense, 2 frameshift) were reported in three individuals with CHD (PMID: 30293987, 34328347), but only one of them with a frameshift variant was included in this curation. The other two were not scored due to high minor allele frequency (>0.00001) on gnomAD v.4.1.0. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by evidence showing localized expression in the developing heart in mouse embryo, protein interaction studies with GATA4, a null mouse model showing heart defects, and a rescue in morpholino knockdown zebrafish embryos with murine *Fog1* (PMID: 14614148, 16316643). In summary, there is limited evidence supporting the relationship between *ZFPM1* and autosomal dominant congenital heart disease. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship.
