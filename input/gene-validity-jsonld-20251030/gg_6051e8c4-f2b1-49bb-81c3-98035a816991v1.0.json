The 3β-HSD enzymatic system plays a crucial role in the biosynthesis of all classes of hormonal steroids and HSD VII is active against four 7-alpha-hydroxylated sterols. The deficiency of 3β-HSD causes congenital defects of bile acid synthesis, characterized by neonatal onset of progressive liver disease with cholestatic jaundice and malabsorption of lipids and lipid-soluble vitamins from the gastrointestinal tract resulting from a primary failure to synthesize bile acids. Affected infants show failure to thrive and secondary coagulopathy. At least 53 cases of 3β-HSD have been reported (reviewed in PMID: 26080666), with six variants (missense, frameshift, and nonsense) from 6 probands (and 1 additional family member) in 2 publications (PMIDs: 11067870, 12679481) included here. This gene-disease association is also supported by its biochemical functions in bile acid synthesis and enriched expression in the liver (PMID: 11067870). Additionally, a knockout mouse model that recapitulates human phenotype (PMID: 17601774). In summary, *HSD3B7* is definitively associated with autosomal recessive congenital bile acid synthesis defect 1. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6051e8c4-f2b1-49bb-81c3-98035a816991","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ca1a2268-641c-422f-b065-8866af654d94","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ca1a2268-641c-422f-b065-8866af654d94_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10097","date":"2022-07-11T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ca1a2268-641c-422f-b065-8866af654d94_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10097","date":"2022-07-22T16:39:05.247Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ca1a2268-641c-422f-b065-8866af654d94_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ca1a2268-641c-422f-b065-8866af654d94_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/aa414f50-0184-4afe-b706-a37075d08457","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"\n","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fee9f0a8-3d44-4fbf-a3fa-fbd34b7257f7","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Loss of the HSD3B7 enzyme in the mouse changes the types of bile acids synthesized by the liver.
