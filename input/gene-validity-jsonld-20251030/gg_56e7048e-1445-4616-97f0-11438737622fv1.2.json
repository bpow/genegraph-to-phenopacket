Over 50 unique variants (including missense, nonsense, and frameshift variants) have been reported in humans. Evidence ​supporting this gene-disease relationship includes ​case-level genetic data and experimental data linking biallelic POMT2 loss of function to myopathy.\nSummary of Case-Level Data (12 points): Variants in this gene have been reported in over 70 probands with POMT2-related myopathy. The phenotypes described in these individuals range widely in severity and age of onset, with some patients exhibiting Walker-Warburg syndrome surviving only days or weeks beyond birth, while later onset has been reported in patients with milder limb-girdle muscular dystrophy with or without intellectual disability. At least 10 probands reported to date (PMID: 17923109; DOI: 10.1007/978-3-319-07500-6_17; PMID: 24183756; PMID: 30060766 Patients 20, 22, and 26; PMID: 29175898 Case 5; PMID: 29759639; DOI: 10.21203/rs.2.483/v1; PMID: 32576226 Patient 39) meet the LGMD GCEP criteria for isolated LGMD (progressive weakness in limb musculature (pelvic and shoulder girdle); independent ambulation by the age 2 years; elevated CK of >2X the ULN; muscle biopsy with dystrophic and myopathic features).\nSummary of Experimental Data (5.5 points): This gene-disease relationship is supported by expression studies, biochemical function studies, animal models, and rescue experiments in patient cells and Drosophila. The POMT2 protein is involved in the catalysis of the initiation step of the O-mannosyl glycosylation pathway on the mucin-like domain of α-dystroglycan. Defects in the glycosylation of α-dystroglycan disrupt dystroglycan binding to laminin-G domain-containing extracellular proteins in muscle and brain and are well-known to lead to dystroglycanopathies (PMID: 23929950). Loss of POMT2 in patient cells and Drosophila and mouse models leads to hallmark biochemical and phenotypic features, some of which have been mitigated by rescue (PMID: 29759639; PMID: 29167399; PMID: 15271988; PMID: 16219785; PMID: 20644630; PMID: 21452199; PMID: 21970971).\nIn summary, POMT2 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive myopathies. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time.\nThis classification was approved by the ClinGen Neuromuscular Working Group on 9/14/2021 (SOP Version 7) and updated to SOP Version 8 on 11/2/2021.\nLumping and Splitting Considerations: OMIM entities: autosomal recessive congenital muscular dystrophy-dystroglycanopathy with brain and eye anomalies type A2 (MIM: 613150); autosomal recessive congenital muscular dystrophy-dystroglycanopathy with mental retardation type B2 (MIM: 613156); autosomal recessive limb-girdle muscular dystrophy-dystroglycanopathy type C2 (MIM: 613158). Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in molecular mechanisms AND inheritance pattern AND phenotypic variability in the above mentioned disease entities. Therefore, all of the disease entities have been lumped into one disease entity: POMT2-related myopathy  (MONDO:0700071). Lumping decision approved on 4/13/2021.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/56e7048e-1445-4616-97f0-11438737622f","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/32427fb1-d583-47eb-a368-685ef56bad3d","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":{"id":"cg:expertPanelChange"},"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/32427fb1-d583-47eb-a368-685ef56bad3d_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10151","date":"2024-08-03T13:37:16.598Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/32427fb1-d583-47eb-a368-685ef56bad3d_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10151","date":"2024-07-26T06:30:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["ErrorClarification"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/32427fb1-d583-47eb-a368-685ef56bad3d_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/32427fb1-d583-47eb-a368-685ef56bad3d_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/27a1ac56-bb80-48f9-a819-391b59491ab5","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"In addition to the evidence presented in this publication that POMT2 is expressed in mouse muscle and cardiac tissue, evidence from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project also suggests POMT2 is expressed in brain and muscle tissue (http://gtexportal.org/home/gene/POMT2).","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f0e2bf36-53c1-420e-93ee-8c65b43a82ff","type":"Finding","dc:description":"POMT2 has been shown to be expressed in mouse skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle in a similar pattern to that observed for POMT1.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17456771","rdfs:label":"POMT2 Expression in Muscle Tissue","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3b99c525-2f16-40e8-b89c-bfede2b39704","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"POMT2 is one of many proteins in the glycosylation pathway of α-dystroglycan including DAG1, FKRP, FKTN, GMPPB, POMT1, POMGNT1, and POMGNT2.

Between 11 and 16 years of age, the proband developed progressive facial weakness, nasal voice, mild upper limb girdle weakness and wasting, while muscle strength remained normal in the lower limbs.

Immunohistochemistry of dystrophin, a-, b-, g-, and d-sarcoglycan, caveolin 3 and laminin a2, as well as immunoblot of calpain 3 and dysferlin, showed normal expression of these proteins. a-DG was slightly reduced by immunostaining (VIA4-1 and IIH6C4 antibodies) and appeared as a smeared band by western blotting (IIH6C4 antibody).","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0003557","obo:HP_0031964","obo:HP_0031956","obo:HP_0031481","obo:HP_0000276","obo:HP_0003326","obo:HP_0001611","obo:HP_0003484","obo:HP_0003202","obo:HP_0006889","obo:HP_0031651","obo:HP_0003236","obo:HP_0030319","obo:HP_0003458","obo:HP_0003394","obo:HP_0003325","obo:HP_0000194","obo:HP_0200021"],"sex":"Female","variant":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/36d67be3-9822-4ebd-8537-0d8b84e1a322_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24183756","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b0df28c2-7331-4897-bb12-43f5284638d4"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"}},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a0b07aaf-90d3-4595-8d56-8819d30a1608_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24183756","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2ee0c236-e48e-4355-a6be-0e3e8d3a5bdc"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"}}]},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a0b07aaf-90d3-4595-8d56-8819d30a1608","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The NM_013382.7(POMT2):c.1517C>T (p.Pro506Leu) missense variant reported in this proband in compound heterozygosity (confirmed in trans) is not present in the gnomAD population database.
