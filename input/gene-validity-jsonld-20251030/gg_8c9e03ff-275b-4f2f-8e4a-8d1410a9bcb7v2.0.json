Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found differences in inheritance pattern and phenotypic variability. Therefore, the following disease entities have been split into two disease entities, autosomal recessive nonsyndromic genetic deafness (OMIM:616515) and autosomal dominant nonsyndromic genetic deafness (OMIM:607017). The split curation for autosomal dominant nonsyndromic genetic deafness has been curated separately. Two variants (splice-site, nonsense) that have been reported in nine probands in two publications (PMIDs: 24958875, 37864412) are included in this curation. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss-of-function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence (mouse model, zebrafish model, expression-level evidence, functional alteration evidence; PMIDs: 24958875, 27269051, 30280293). Mutant mice and zebrafish show significant hearing loss. Expression-level evidence indicates that the gene is expressed in inner and outer hair cells. The gene is shown to interact with MYH9, which is classified as definitive for an autosomal dominant condition, of which hearing loss is a feature. This gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the Hearing Loss GCEP on 9/18/2018. It was re-evaluated on 5/15/2024. As a result of this reevaluation, the classification changed from moderate to strong, due to the addition of genetic evidence and experimental evidence (protein interaction evidence) (PMIDs: 30280293, 37864412). In summary, there is strong evidence to support the relationship between RIPOR2 and autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss. More than two publications of genetic evidence are required for a definitive classification, and there are currently only two. We will re-evaluate this gene-disease relationship in the future to determine if an upgraded classification of definitive is warranted. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hearing Loss GCEP on the meeting date 5/15/2024 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8c9e03ff-275b-4f2f-8e4a-8d1410a9bcb7","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ed7e0813-4e94-40a9-b3ef-ef90d5c4dce4","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Strong","changes":[{"id":"cg:sopChange"},{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},{"id":"cg:classificationChange"},{"id":"cg:newEvidence"},{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ed7e0813-4e94-40a9-b3ef-ef90d5c4dce4_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2024-05-15T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ed7e0813-4e94-40a9-b3ef-ef90d5c4dce4_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2024-07-02T15:19:38.474Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["RecurationTiming"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ed7e0813-4e94-40a9-b3ef-ef90d5c4dce4_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ed7e0813-4e94-40a9-b3ef-ef90d5c4dce4_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f983b35b-94d2-439c-b550-df0f9d61722c","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/60a0e881-3c09-4644-b077-573cbee95243","type":"Finding","dc:description":"In transfected COS7 cells, wild-type FAM65B was found in the plasma membrane of the cell as is the cortical actin network and was also in the intracellular membrane compartment. \nHowever, mutated FAM65B (missing exon 3) was found in cytoplasmic inclusion bodies but not membranes.
