{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5cb6f076-e4f1-42e1-887e-fe6a3c96c4a0v1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"TRPV4 was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia, Maroteaux type (SEMD-M) as early as 2010 (Nishimura et al., PMID: 20503319). This disorder includes the parastremmatic dwarfism phenotype and is also known as pseudo-Morquio syndrome type 2. At least 6 variants (missense, frameshift) in TRPV4 have been reported in probands diagnosed with SEMD-M. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation includes 6 variants in 7 probands reported in 3 publications (PMIDs: 20503319, 14755468, 12884428). The mechanism of pathogenicity is suggested to be gain of function (PMIDs: 31463371). This gene-disease relationship is also supported by expression studies and in vitro functional assays (PMIDs: 18762026, 19790068, 21964574). Of note, variants in this gene have also been shown to cause metatropic dysplasia, spondylometaphyseal dysplasia Kozlowski type (SMD-K), brachyolmia, and familial digital arthropathy with brachydactyly, which comprise a spectrum of phenotypes and will be curated separately. In some cases, there is overlap between skeletal and neuromuscular phenotypes caused by variants in TRPV4 (PMID: 31191204). Patients presenting with skeletal dysplasias may benefit from neurological, respiratory, and audiological evaluations. In summary, there is moderate but suggestive evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more published evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has been published, and the overlap in phenotypes with metatropic dysplasia and SMD-K are supportive of the association between TRPV4 and SEMD-M. This curation was approved by the ClinGen Skeletal Disorders Gene Curation Expert Panel on 5/19/21 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5cb6f076-e4f1-42e1-887e-fe6a3c96c4a0","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/17fcb720-754a-429a-b1f8-90db6d423a89","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/17fcb720-754a-429a-b1f8-90db6d423a89_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10065","date":"2021-05-19T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/17fcb720-754a-429a-b1f8-90db6d423a89_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10065","date":"2021-06-09T17:52:57.787Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/17fcb720-754a-429a-b1f8-90db6d423a89_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/17fcb720-754a-429a-b1f8-90db6d423a89_ad_other_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/78c29ffc-d59a-464d-a46e-058b69c90213_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Upgraded
