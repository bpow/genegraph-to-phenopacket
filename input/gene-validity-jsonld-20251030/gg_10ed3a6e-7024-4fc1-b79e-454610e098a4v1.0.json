The HIBCH gene encodes 3-hydroxyisobutyryl-CoA hydrolase which is a mitochondrial enzyme with a critical role in valine catabolism and propionate metabolism. In the valine catabolic pathway, HIBCH converts 3-hydroxyisobutyryl-CoA to free 3-hydroxyisobutyrate and 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA to 3-hydroxypropionate. Methacrylyl-CoA and acryloyl-CoA are the metabolites converted to 3-hydroxyisobutyryl-CoA and 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA, respectively, by the enzyme short-chain enoyl-CoA hydratase, SCEH, encoded by ECHS1 in the step immediately before HIBCH. ECHS1 variants are also associated with autosomal recessive Leigh syndrome spectrum. The exact disease mechanism has not been fully elucidated, but elevated levels of methacrylyl-CoA and acryloyl-CoA are toxic, postulated to react with exposed thiol groups and thus impair the function of multiple mitochondrial enzymes including components of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex and the oxidative phosphorylation complexes (PMID: 24299452).\n\nThe HIBCH gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Leigh syndrome spectrum in 2007 (PMID: 17160907). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included 13 variants in 12 cases from 8 publications (PMIDs: 31523596, 32022391, 24299452, 17160907, 32677093, 26163321, 25251209, 25591832). No segregation data were available. Loss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease association is also supported by known biochemical function, expression, functional alterations in patient cells, and model organisms (PMIDs: 27977873, 25613900, 27400804, 31127358). \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support this gene-disease relationship, including that more than three years have elapsed from the first proposal of the association. This classification was approved by the NICHD U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on April 14, 2021 (SOP Version 7).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/10ed3a6e-7024-4fc1-b79e-454610e098a4","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/079ed613-0c28-494f-9852-9baf495f26ba","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/079ed613-0c28-494f-9852-9baf495f26ba_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2021-06-14T14:23:39.036Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/079ed613-0c28-494f-9852-9baf495f26ba_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2021-06-14T14:23:17.786Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/079ed613-0c28-494f-9852-9baf495f26ba_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0b8f8476-6309-4628-8aaa-09191f0a0263_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Homozygous c.1128_1129insT:p.Lys377*; results in a frameshift and a premature stop codon in the last exon, truncating the conserved C-terminus of the protein; absent in gnomAD queried 4/7/2021; Both healthy parents were heterozygous carriers; patient cells were studied in quadruplicate and each time resulted in undetectable HIBCH activity.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d849798c-b76f-4356-a0d8-a5212b896e90","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25251209","rdfs:label":"Case report","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":7,"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"7 months: psychomotor delay\n\nBrain MRI; symmetric signal abnormalities of the basal ganglia and reduced brain volume \n\nPAA/UOA/ACP normal; after dx'ed with HIBCH deficiency, ACP re-analyzed: elevation of hydroxy-C4-carnitine (nine months: 0.66 mM, three years five months: 0.81 mM; normal: <0.4 mM [Ferdinandusse et al., 2013]; Fig. 3B). \n\nBlood lactate elevated (2.4–4.3 mmol/l).\n\nETC complexes I–IV and PDC activities were normal in muscle biopsy, but a borderline depletion of mtDNA was noted (30% relative mtDNA content compared to nuclear DNA in real-time quantitative PCR analysis)\n\n23 months: could not sit independently, no head control\n\n3 years old: second MRI showed symmetric volume reduction of the brain, enlarged ventricles and hyperintense signals of the basal ganglia in T2 weighing (putamen, globus pallidus, and caudate nucleus; Fig. 2A).

Thus, the significance of this particular mutation on splicing was investigated by analysis of HIBCH cDNA.

Indeed, the intronic DNA sequence adjacent to the IVS2-3C>G mutation presented a strong homology to the consensus sequence of a splice acceptor site, with identity at 9 of 10 intronic bases.
