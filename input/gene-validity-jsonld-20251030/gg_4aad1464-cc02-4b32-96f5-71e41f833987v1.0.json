Only four de novo missense variants, two of which result in an identical Gly82Arg protein change, have been reported in humans. A single mild recessive case with a homozygous splicing variant has been reported in the literature, however given no other cases and a lack of functional studies they have not been evaluated in this curation.  Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data.\nVariants in this gene have been reported in six probands in four separate publications (PMIDs: 23934111, 27476654, 28777935, 30937933). Each of these cases stem from a de novo missense variant that affects one of the transmembrane helices in the trimerization domain. The mechanism for disease is a heterozygous dominant negative effect, with missense variants disrupting the monomeric and trimeric structures of the protein causing a reduction of glutamate transport activity by both WT and mutant protein (Stergachis et al., PMID: 30937933). \nThis gene-disease association, in addition to the integral biochemical function of being a CNS glutamate transporter, is also supported by multiple mouse models. A knock-out mouse model showed significantly increased fatality rates due to epileptic seizure activity and susceptibility to brain injury, recapitulating the phenotypes of the human disorder but without the dominant negative mechanism. Similarly, a conditional knock-out of GLT-1 in mouse astrocytes and neurons demonstrates that astrocytic GLT-1 protects against seizures and epilepsy while neuronal GLT-1 is integral to glutamate uptake. This clearly shows that alteration of protein expression can have significant impacts on overall function.\nIn summary, SLC1A2 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant early infantile epileptic encephalopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4aad1464-cc02-4b32-96f5-71e41f833987","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ebb83674-206f-461b-b98e-e12420208deb","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ebb83674-206f-461b-b98e-e12420208deb_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10011","date":"2020-11-03T19:51:06.614Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ebb83674-206f-461b-b98e-e12420208deb_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10011","date":"2020-10-29T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ebb83674-206f-461b-b98e-e12420208deb_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ebb83674-206f-461b-b98e-e12420208deb_ad_dn_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/573e4fef-1563-4efd-a42c-0a66b0c7cb64_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Sufficient phenotypic evidence plus indirect variant-level evidence for a confirmed de-novo variant (In PMID:30937933, the Leu85Pro variant expressed in HEK cells formed fewer monomeric and trimeric plasma membrane-bound protein and significantly reduced glutamate uptake via a dominant negative manner to reduce transporter function; the Gly82Arg variant affects the same region of the SLC1A2 trimerization domain) yields slightly reduced points.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/73c667be-57eb-48aa-904a-eb89f73fbb3d","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28777935","rdfs:label":"GuA","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Weeks","ageValue":6,"detectionMethod":"Variants within co-expressed candidate genes in Table S1 were extracted from exome sequencing data.
