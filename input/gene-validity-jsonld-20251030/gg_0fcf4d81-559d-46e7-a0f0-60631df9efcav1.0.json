Variants in HARS2 were first reported in humans with this disease as early as 2011 (Pierce et al.). At least 3 missense variants have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least  3 probands in 2 publications (21464306, 27650058). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 4 additional family members. Experimental evidence from S. cerevisiae and C. elegans models provide some evidence of the gene-disease association. In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease association. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease association. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hearing Loss Working Group on 5/15/2018.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0fcf4d81-559d-46e7-a0f0-60631df9efca","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5c5ed5f6-4068-4e15-a195-6098e4ee2093","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5c5ed5f6-4068-4e15-a195-6098e4ee2093_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2018-05-15T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5c5ed5f6-4068-4e15-a195-6098e4ee2093_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5c5ed5f6-4068-4e15-a195-6098e4ee2093_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5c5ed5f6-4068-4e15-a195-6098e4ee2093_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cba91cdf-619e-47d6-b3db-341e6f226d98","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Downgraded because yeast model; phenotype cannot be tested for in S. cerevisiae.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1e275260-6927-4625-985d-63308a080d35","type":"Finding","dc:description":"S. cerevisiae HTS1 is expressed in cytoplasm and mitochondria and is equivalent to HARS2 (expressed in mitochondria).
