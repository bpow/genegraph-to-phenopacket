{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a222ab78-7366-459f-9295-44e6c8f311d7v1.1","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"The SMO gene is located on chromosome 7 at 7q32.1 and encodes a G protein-coupled receptor that interacts with the patched protein, a receptor for hedgehog proteins. SMO was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Pallister-Hall-like syndrome in 2018 by Rubino et al. (PMID: 30497210). Pallister-Hall-like syndrome is a pleiotropic disorder characterized by postaxial polydactyly, hypothalamic hamartoma, cardiac and skeletal anomalies, craniofacial dysmorphisms, and language delay. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, the ClinGen Craniofacial Malformations GCEP found differences in inheritance pattern and phenotypic variability between the disease assertions. Therefore, the following disease entities have been split into multiple disease entities, Curry-Jones syndrome (OMIM:601707) and Pallister-Hall-like syndrome (OMIM:241800). The split curation for Curry-Jones syndrome has been curated separately by the Craniofacial Malformations GCEP. Here, the Syndromic Disorders GCEP has curated the relationship between SMO and Pallister-Hall-like syndrome. Seven variants (5 missense, 1 nonsense, and 1 splicing variants) that have been reported in five probands in two publications (PMIDs: 32413283, 35034092) are included in this curation. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by expression, protein-protein interactions, biochemical function, and animal model evidence (PMIDs: 29558958, 11440720, 27801979, 29571613, 32413283). In summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged.This classification was approved by the ClinGen Syndromic Disorders GCEP on the meeting date October 20th, 2023 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a222ab78-7366-459f-9295-44e6c8f311d7","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/33566da0-0f61-4dc5-b629-affb4e68e9c7","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/33566da0-0f61-4dc5-b629-affb4e68e9c7_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10060","date":"2024-01-22T21:13:14.888Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/33566da0-0f61-4dc5-b629-affb4e68e9c7_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10060","date":"2023-10-20T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/33566da0-0f61-4dc5-b629-affb4e68e9c7_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/33566da0-0f61-4dc5-b629-affb4e68e9c7_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/198c7a6c-d686-4ae5-969b-2a846ddacf18","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/55c11bac-6c77-4a8a-b1ab-2dcb2a7e851d","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Le et al. performed qPCR with primers specific to SMO transcript on mRNA extracted from fibroblasts of affected individuals and two unrelated age-matched controls.
