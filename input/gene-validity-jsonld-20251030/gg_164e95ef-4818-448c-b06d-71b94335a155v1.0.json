{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/164e95ef-4818-448c-b06d-71b94335a155v1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"The relationship between *UQCRC2* and primary mitochondrial disease was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of January 20, 2022. The *UQCRC2* gene encodes a subunit of complex III (UQCRC2) of the mitochondrial respiratory chain.\nThe *UQCRC2* gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive mitochondrial disease in 2013 (PMID: 23281071). While various names have been given to the constellation of features seen in those with *UQCRC2*-related disease, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *UQCRC2* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included two unique homozygous missense variants identified in three cases from three publications (PMIDs: 23281071, 28275242, 33865955). These individuals had neonatal hypoglycemia, lactic acidosis, and hepatopathy; and one individual had bilateral brainstem lesions consistent with Leigh syndrome spectrum. The Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel reviewed scoring guidance for homozygous variants in cases with consanguinity and decided that no scoring alteration was needed in these three cases given (1) comprehensive analyses (exome sequencing) were performed, (2) homozygous variants are a common cause of mitochondrial disease, and (3) biochemical evidence in these cases supported a complex III defect. Segregation data are available but did not meet criteria to be considered for scoring per ClinGen Gene Curation SOP V8. Loss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease association is also supported by the known biochemical function, functional alteration in patient cells, and rescue in patient cells (PMIDs: 28844695, 23281071, 28275242, 33865955).\nIn summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on January 20, 2022 (SOP Version 8).\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/164e95ef-4818-448c-b06d-71b94335a155","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/82ab14de-02cb-477a-89dd-20210c103ead","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/82ab14de-02cb-477a-89dd-20210c103ead_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2022-05-31T23:33:22.950Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/82ab14de-02cb-477a-89dd-20210c103ead_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2022-01-20T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/82ab14de-02cb-477a-89dd-20210c103ead_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/82ab14de-02cb-477a-89dd-20210c103ead_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bbcb8104-f2e7-4a6c-a1f2-0fc1652ea04a","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bd631f48-0cd3-4209-bd08-213b1f0b7bcf","type":"Finding","dc:description":"In short, steady state level of UQCRC2 and UQCRC1 (which was shown to be decreased in patient cells) increased more with the re expressed WT cells than the construct mutant cells p.G222A and patient cells (w/ empty vector)\n\nMaximal respiration was highest in re expressed WT cells which was significantly greater than patient cells and overexpressed\n\n\nAlthough the increase in mitochondrial UQCRC2 level upon stable transfection with the wild-type UQCRC2 construct did not reach the control UQCRC2 levels, it was clearly accompanied by a comparable increase in the level of the UQCRC1 subunit.
