Increased tPA release has been reported with hyperfibrinolysis (PMID: 6401391), which manifests as excessive bleeding, while decreased release leads to hypofibrinolysis (PMID: 665314, PMID: 6890710), which can result in thrombosis or embolism. The reported hypofibrinolysis due to decreased tPA has not been confirmed to be a result of genetic variation in *PLAT* though an assertion has been made for autosomal dominant thrombophilia due to decreased release of tissue plasminogen activator. Diagnostic high-throughput sequencing of bleeding, thrombotic and platelet disorders has identified two heterozygous missense variants in patients with deep vein thrombosis (PMID: 31064749). These are rare variants of uncertain significance, which have not been functionally characterized. The biochemical function of *PLAT* in fibrinolysis (PMID: 6541693) and a homozygous null mouse model (PMID: 8133887) with increased thrombosis are consistent with the possibility of a *PLAT* related thrombophilia. Although there has been an assertion of a gene-disease relationship, the evidence is not compelling with only a few cases with non-specific phenotypes and uncharacterized missense variants. In summary, the evidence supporting the relationship between *PLAT* and autosomal dominant thrombophilia has been disputed. More evidence is needed to either support or entirely refute the role *PLAT* plays in this disease.\n\nOf note, several polymorphisms in *PLAT* have been associated with vascular t-PA release, with conflicting results, regarding their possible association with cardiovascular disease (PMIDs: 9193430, 10959683, 12891381, 12643326) however these were not considered in the curation of autosomal dominant thrombophilia. Additionally, an autosomal recessive lethal hydranencephaloly-diaphragmatic hernia syndrome has been reported in one patient with a frameshift variant in *PLAT* (PMID: 27417437), but due to differences in inheritance pattern and phenotypic variability this is considered a separate disease entity from the autosomal dominant thrombophilia and was not considered in this curation.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b6113366-42ec-4a18-8a15-5fd818f6a844","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c280374c-5c63-46e4-b1a0-26cdd12e357d","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c280374c-5c63-46e4-b1a0-26cdd12e357d_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2023-06-07T19:47:30.143Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c280374c-5c63-46e4-b1a0-26cdd12e357d_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2023-06-07T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"Although there has been an assertion of a gene-disease relationship, the evidence is not compelling with only a few cases with non-specific phenotypes and uncharacterized missense variants.
