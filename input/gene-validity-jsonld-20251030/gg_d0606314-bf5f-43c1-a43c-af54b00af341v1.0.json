Two patients proposed to be affected with this disease have been reported (PMID: 6150136 and PMID: 20597). However, they were never investigated genetically, and later reviews highlight the incomplete and unproven nature of this diagnosis due to the evaluation of the enzyme only (PMID: 9607396). Although this gene-disease association is supported by its biochemical function and an animal model with preweaning lethality (PMID: 27626380), no reports\nhave directly implicated the gene in humans.\n\nThis gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the FAO GCEP on 08/14/2018.  It was reevaluated on 01/15/2021.  As a result of this reevaluation, the classification did not change as no new information is contributing to the classification.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d0606314-bf5f-43c1-a43c-af54b00af341","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3942e058-e6bd-4a4c-b532-e1be1cd8a96e","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"NoKnownDiseaseRelationship","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3942e058-e6bd-4a4c-b532-e1be1cd8a96e_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10010","date":"2021-01-25T19:49:01.487Z","role":"Unpublisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7cb46678-6e33-4d34-86ba-fdf59e59fb80_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10010","date":"2021-01-25T19:49:01.487Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7cb46678-6e33-4d34-86ba-fdf59e59fb80_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10010","date":"2021-01-25T19:48:53.212Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"No cases have been genetically confirmed.","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7cb46678-6e33-4d34-86ba-fdf59e59fb80_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7cb46678-6e33-4d34-86ba-fdf59e59fb80_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/58114901-831b-4a08-912e-9c3c7e1ce92c","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Down-scoring this model in recognition that no human phenotype has yet been observed/reported and so this model cannot be said to re-capitulate the human disease.
