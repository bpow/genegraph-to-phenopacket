The proposed disease mechanism is loss of function. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data. Three variants (all missense) have been reported in two probands in two publications (PMIDs: 25331638, 31656313) for a genetic evidence score of 1.75 points. Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 2 additional family members (PMID: 31656313). This gene-disease association is supported by animal models and an expression study (PMIDs: 25331638, 31656313) detailing expression of TMEM132E in the mouse cochlea, phenocopied ARNHL in Zebrafish, and wild type rescue of the phenotype seen in Zebrafish whereas the variant seen in the proband (PMID: 25331638) did not. This resulted in an experimental evidence score of 3.5 points. In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the Hearing Loss Gene Curation Expert Panel on 11/21/2017 (SOP Version 5). It was reevaluated with the addition of one publication (PMID: 31656313) on 1/19/2022 (SOP v8). As a result of this reevaluation, the classification did not change.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/99b79681-2339-4e7e-b928-508094f00a30","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/867fc085-f2f4-40f6-8b96-565d131fd964","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/867fc085-f2f4-40f6-8b96-565d131fd964_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2022-01-26T16:32:48.770Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/867fc085-f2f4-40f6-8b96-565d131fd964_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2022-01-26T16:32:40.414Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/867fc085-f2f4-40f6-8b96-565d131fd964_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/867fc085-f2f4-40f6-8b96-565d131fd964_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3ed56002-9a2e-44af-a40a-ba8335189c77","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/06939ad1-beba-4762-8923-42907263caf4","type":"Finding","dc:description":"TMEM132E transcripts were present in mouse cochlea at a high level compared to other tissues by RT-qPCR.
