This patient carries a de novo p.Gly12Arg variant in NRAS and was assessed via WES. However, the age of evaluation may be a potential confounding factor of this diagnosis. The NRAS gene is also located in the Ras/MAPK pathway, which is associated with the CS phenotype (Aoki et al., 2016; Rauen, 2013). For now, the association remains as Limited, but will likely move to Disputed with time. Of note, NRAS has also been classified as Definitive in association with Noonan syndrome (NS) and as Limited in association with NS with multiple lentigines and cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome. The ClinGen RASopathy Expert Panel found no evidence associating NRAS with NS-like disorder with loose anagen hair. This curation was approved by the ClinGen RASopathy Gene Curation Expert Panel on 7/24/18 (SOP Version 5).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c132cf1e-aa42-4f2e-8042-eb86a2f58aba","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/28526e91-0db9-4724-94f3-e4222ace602c","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","changes":{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/28526e91-0db9-4724-94f3-e4222ace602c_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10021","date":"2021-03-09T20:32:08.572Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/28526e91-0db9-4724-94f3-e4222ace602c_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10021","date":"2018-07-24T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/28526e91-0db9-4724-94f3-e4222ace602c_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/28526e91-0db9-4724-94f3-e4222ace602c_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/58e0e163-334c-47c2-954d-2b94ab0c92b2","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8435d131-0f19-4aae-a1ce-58efa1b9bd71","type":"Finding","dc:description":"This gene is associated with the RAS/MAPK pathway which is associated with Costello syndrome","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23875798","rdfs:label":"RAS/MAPK pathway NRAS","demonstrates":{"id":"obo:MI_0915"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/28526e91-0db9-4724-94f3-e4222ace602c_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/28526e91-0db9-4724-94f3-e4222ace602c_ad_dn_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cdd89b4d-9f52-447a-aa82-7aa3346f669a_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Variant was identified in a de novo case with suspected Costello syndrome due to a brain lesion of the hypothalamus.
