The gene-disease relationship of RHBDF2 and TOC was first reported by Blaydon et al. 2012(PMID: 22265016). Five unique missense variants in the RHBDF2 gene were reported to segregate with disease in 6 families, suggesting heterozygous gain of function is the mechanism of tumorigenesis for this gene. This gene-disease relationship is further supported by several mouse models and functional alteration studies. In summary, RHBDF2 is definitively associated with Tylosis esophageal cancer (TOC). This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9eb322a2-175a-4b00-bf98-031d71e62125","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b7e72765-1a53-44fb-bfee-9e5923507bbe","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b7e72765-1a53-44fb-bfee-9e5923507bbe_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10023","date":"2020-07-30T21:22:32.808Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b7e72765-1a53-44fb-bfee-9e5923507bbe_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10023","date":"2020-09-16T19:23:29.204Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b7e72765-1a53-44fb-bfee-9e5923507bbe_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b7e72765-1a53-44fb-bfee-9e5923507bbe_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/055edad4-b4de-4380-907e-7ce989b17079","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Rhbdf2 P159L/P159L mice recapitulates the phenotype of TOC patients, suggesting that Rhbdf2 P159L is a GOF mutation, and that this GOF mutation enhances secretion of AREG and leads to constitutive activation of EGFR signaling to cause TOC.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/42d04c41-cc87-4fe0-bec7-f073c916192b","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Rhbdf2 P159L/P159L mice showed alopecia, rapid cutaneous wound healing, hyperplasia, and hyperkeratosis (Fig. 2).
