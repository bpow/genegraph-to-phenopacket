Signaling through the NF-κB pathway is important for maintaining self-tolerance and regulation of the immune response. *RELA* haploinsufficiency results in impaired NF-κB activation downstream of TLR and TNF stimulation, followed by impaired up-regulation of antiapoptotic genes and increased stromal cell apoptosis. This disorder is characterized predominantly by chronic mucocutaneous ulceration; however, the clinical phenotype broadens to include Behçet’s syndrome and irritable bowel disease. Genetic evidence was included in this curation from four probands in four publications (PMIDs: 28600438, 32969189, 29305315, 35412596). The four reported variants include splice site, frameshift, and nonsense. Experimentally, this gene-disease relationship is supported by its function in the activation of NF-κB-dependent transcription and to prevent apoptosis (PMID: 12881425), which is altered in in HEK293T cells transfected with mutant *RELA* (PMID: 32969189) and in patients, resulting in increased TNF-induced stromal cell death (PMID: 28600438). Defective activation of NF-κB-dependent transcription was rescued in patient cells with expression of WT *RELA* (PMID: 28600438). Furthermore, a Rela+/− mouse model recapitulated the defective NF-κB-dependent transcription and cutaneous ulceration observed in patients (PMID: 28600438). In summary, there is Definitive evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both research and the clinical diagnostic setting and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d48001c4-e730-42ec-b7dd-27210d8066d8","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1e0145f5-c001-420c-9591-c6583862a7ca","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1e0145f5-c001-420c-9591-c6583862a7ca_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10081","date":"2023-09-21T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1e0145f5-c001-420c-9591-c6583862a7ca_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10081","date":"2023-10-02T15:33:03.926Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1e0145f5-c001-420c-9591-c6583862a7ca_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/520111e0-1cee-4379-8cfb-80a63550a317","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The frameshift variant creates a premature stop codon in exon 7 of 11, however it appears to escape NMD as two proteins were identified in the patients with a six kd difference as expected for a truncation.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/520111e0-1cee-4379-8cfb-80a63550a317_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"RelA−/− MEFs expressing wild-type RELA had increased promoter activity (mean ± SEM 6.78 ± 0.78-fold) compared to those expressing RELAp.His487ThrfsTer7.","functionalDataSupport":"Yes"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/520111e0-1cee-4379-8cfb-80a63550a317_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32969189","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8797ad31-d118-4b1c-b816-2a4275e7a6e8","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_021975.4(RELA):c.1459del (p.His487ThrfsTer7)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA475476089"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:AlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Heterozygous"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a9c5aa69-2d4b-45bf-9228-ed8d48749f00","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"This variant disrupts the canonical donor splice site of intron 7, instead of causing an in-frame skipping of exon 6, alternative splicing (at a new donor site, predicted by SpliceAI to be 74bp downstream) was observed by Sanger sequencing of patient cDNA.
