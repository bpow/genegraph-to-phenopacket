It forms the BCDX2 complex with RAD51B, RAD51C, and RAD51D, and is required for HR repair.  There are 3 exons that make up the protein, and there is a G to A transition located in exon 3 that results in a substitution of histidine (His) by arginine (Arg), known as R188H (Arg188His, rs3218536).  This polymorphism has been widely investigated to explore its potential impact on cancer susceptibility. Biallelic XRCC2 mutations are associated with Fanconi anemia, complementation group U, Premature ovarian failure, and Spermatogenic failure. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we only focus on hereditary breast cancer (refute the association with breast cancer) in this curation. Evidence refuting this gene-disease relationship includes case-control data, while experimental data supports the role of XRCC2 in DNA repair. \n \n**Summary of Case-Control Data: 0 POINTS**\n\nThis gene-disease relationship has been studied in at least 11 case-control studies at the aggregate variant level. In 2021, two large case-control studies [CARRIERS (PMID: 33471974) and BCAC (PMID: 33471991); both with more than 32 thousand cases and controls] did not identify a significant association of aggregate loss of function (LOF) variants in XRCC2 and breast cancer. Nine other case-control studies, with smaller populations ranging from 150 to 13078, likewise, did not show any association of LOF variants with breast cancer. Various populations were involved, including Pakistani (PMID: 25556451), South Indian (PMID: 35061678), Tanzania (PMID: 35691022), British (PMID: 28779002), Ethnic Slavs (PMID: 31173646), Chinese (PMID: 4642895), Cyprus (PMID: 16485136), and US American (PMID: 14578164 and 18188695).\n \n**Summary of Experimental Data: 2 POINTS**\n\nWhile case control studies did not support the gene-disease association, two experimental studies showing the role of XRCC2 in heightened sensitivity to ionizing radiation and particularly to the DNA cross-linking chemical mitomycin C (0.5 point for each study, PMID: 10422536, 11025669). Another study reported that in chicken cells, RAD51 paralog mutant cells (like XRCC2), exhibited that same pattern of hypermutation (0.5 point, PMID:15657438).  Lastly, knock-out mice exhibited chromosomal instability and embryonic lethality (0.5 point, PMID:11118202).   \n \n**Overall Summary:**\n\nIn summary, given the lack of significant association in large breast cancer case-control studies to date, there is convincing evidence refuting the association between XRCC2 and autosomal dominant hereditary breast cancer, which significantly outweighs the evidence supporting the association. This gene-disease pair was originally evaluated as disputed by the Breast/Ovarian Cancer GCEP on 5/10//2017. This re-curation was approved by the ClinGen Hereditary Diseases GCEP on 2/17/2023 (SOP Version 9).\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/713e2a61-80e8-4b15-af24-4ed7747220cf","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f7f253e9-bb78-44c5-bab1-6e8017eeb69c","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f7f253e9-bb78-44c5-bab1-6e8017eeb69c_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10023","date":"2023-03-14T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f7f253e9-bb78-44c5-bab1-6e8017eeb69c_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10023","date":"2023-03-14T20:14:39.404Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"Given the lack of significant association in large breast cancer case-control studies to date, there is convincing evidence refuting the association between XRCC2 and autosomal dominant hereditary breast cancer, which significantly outweighs the evidence supporting the association.
