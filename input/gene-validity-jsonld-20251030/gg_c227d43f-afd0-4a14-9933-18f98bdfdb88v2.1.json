This variant was reported to segregate with the disease in 3 additional family members. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be dominant-negative. COL4A6 knockout mice have been shown to have similar click-evoked auditory brainstem response, expression of major basement membrane components, and cochlear structures of COL4A6 to WT mice. (PMID: 33848312). Of note, this gene has also been implicated in chronic kidney disease, premature ovarian failure, and diffuse leiomyomatosis in Alport syndrome, and will be assessed separately. This gene-disease association is also supported by expression studies (PMID: 23714752). Immunohistochemical staining of the mouse inner ear with a COL4A6-specific antibody showed pronounced COL4A6 signals at stria vascularis of spiral ligament. Additionally, whole-mount in situ hybridization detected COL4A6 homologs in dorsal midbrain, notochord, and otic vesicle of zebrafish embryos.  In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the Hearing Loss GCEP on 1/16/2018. It was re-evaluated on 2/16/2022. As a result of this reevaluation, the classification did not change, and no new additional information was added to the curation.\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c227d43f-afd0-4a14-9933-18f98bdfdb88","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d026ef00-c6f3-4aa8-a61a-b354b68fe043","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","changes":{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"},"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d026ef00-c6f3-4aa8-a61a-b354b68fe043_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2022-02-16T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d026ef00-c6f3-4aa8-a61a-b354b68fe043_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2023-01-27T18:50:22.876Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d026ef00-c6f3-4aa8-a61a-b354b68fe043_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d026ef00-c6f3-4aa8-a61a-b354b68fe043_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c564136c-1291-47fe-8bf4-bc98fdfbc952","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"default expression points counted for all evidence","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fd3763b4-1ea3-4665-b1d9-62b7f75cb539","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Immunohistochemical staining of mouse inner ear showed pronounced COL4A6 signals at stria vascularis of spiral ligament, more specifically within a subgroup of ganglia cells of the ganglion spirale.
