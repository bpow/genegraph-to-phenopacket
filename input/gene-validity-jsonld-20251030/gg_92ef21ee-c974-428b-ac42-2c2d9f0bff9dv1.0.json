{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/92ef21ee-c974-428b-ac42-2c2d9f0bff9dv1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"*RHO* was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa in 1990 (Dryja et al., PMID: 2137202), *RHO* variants have also been reported as the cause of autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa (PMID: 7987385) and autosomal dominant congenital stationary night blindness (PMID: 8107847). Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping & Splitting Working Group, we found diverse molecular mechanisms underlying these disease entities, ranging from biallelic loss-of-function to monoallelic gain-of-function, but no significant phenotypic variability as well as some overlap in inheritance pattern among the different groups of affected patients. Therefore, retinitis pigmentosa 4 (MIM# 613731) and autosomal dominant congenital stationary night blindness 1 (MIM# 610445) have been lumped into a single curation, under the broad disease term RHO-related retinopathy.\n\nThis curation includes 6 variants (5 missense and 1 nonsense) that have been reported in 5 probands in 6 publications (PMIDs: 1302614, 2137202, 26202387, 7846071, 38111930, 31239368, 34635090). More evidence is available in the literature, but was not required for inclusion. The mechanism of pathogenicity is reported to be mainly gain-of-function or dominant negative, with a few cases being loss-of-function.\n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by animal models, expression studies and *in vitro* functional assays (PMIDs: 38479725, 30976840, 17167410, 21126223, 30239781).\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *RHO* and RHO-related retinopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time without the emergence of conflicting evidence. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Retina GCEP on January, 2nd, 2025 (SOP Version 11).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/92ef21ee-c974-428b-ac42-2c2d9f0bff9d","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/630de829-a884-4a91-9b38-80198f1247d6","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/630de829-a884-4a91-9b38-80198f1247d6_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10072","date":"2025-01-02T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/630de829-a884-4a91-9b38-80198f1247d6_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10072","date":"2025-01-04T21:16:52.609Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/630de829-a884-4a91-9b38-80198f1247d6_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/630de829-a884-4a91-9b38-80198f1247d6_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/24a143e1-2e76-4191-8a32-79d0b5dd5c94","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7b3ec621-faaa-4bbe-abe6-9d1084ef541f","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Knock in mouse with a previously described RHO AD-RP variant ","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30976840","rdfs:label":"knock-in D190N mouse model ","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/86f3e524-b499-43dd-b999-b92f7f4f1d38","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"-Rescue was partial \n-The variant appears to has a dominant negative effect and there is not a clear scoring for that on the SOP","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5f9ef7be-131b-482f-8298-e4d653ac6ac9","type":"Finding","dc:description":"-ERG demonstrated that increased expression of RHO301 slowed the rate of retinal degeneration in P23H mice: at 6 months, a-wave amplitudes were increased by 100% and b-wave amplitudes by 79%.\n-Nontransgenic mice injected with AAV5 RHO301 demonstrated a decrease in the ERG, confirming the damaging effect of rhodopsin overproduction in normal photoreceptors. \n-In P23H mice, the increase in the ERG amplitudes was correlated with improvement of retinal structure: the thickness of the outer nuclear layer in RHO301-treated eyes was increased by 80% compared with control eyes.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21126223","rdfs:label":"AAV Wild type RHO delivery in a P23H RHO +/- mice","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:PhenotypeRescue"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanRescueCriteria","strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":3.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/630de829-a884-4a91-9b38-80198f1247d6_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/595aa344-6e3f-4099-bb3b-e5aeae016a6d","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"upgraded 0.25 pts from the default since its an human cell derived organoid","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ff6982da-8909-40b2-a69e-fd847bf7b553","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"-RHO-mutant organoids exhibited progressive degenerative features affecting rod cells and retinal structure \n-Rod cells in RHO-mutant organoids are temporally dysplastic compared with control organoids ","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38479725","rdfs:label":"Lin_3D retinal organoid model from patient-derived iPSCs"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/630de829-a884-4a91-9b38-80198f1247d6_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c3b08ae0-c238-41f8-b2d0-9342cde2bf50","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/45e8e9c3-fdb5-4174-9ffe-626328bdd766","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Arrestin and activated rhodopsin interacts in specific residues.
