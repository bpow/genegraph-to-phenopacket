It regulates trafficking and gating properties of the channel. *CACNB2* has only been reported in relation to autosomal dominant hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in one Chinese family 2017 (Zhang et al. PMID 28614222) where it was asserted as a possible disease modifier in a family with a known pathogenic *MYBPC3 *variant. Note that this variant is common in the East Asian population (MAF 0.01) and may be benign. As such no clear gene-disease assertion for this gene has been made and there is no other genetic level evidence to support or refute this gene-disease relationship. This gene is expressed in heart tissue (PMIDs 24309898, 21357697, 34307509) and model organisms/functional studies indicate it may play a role in hypertrophic pathways (PMIDs: 34307509, 21111744, 17556655, 21357697, 16946137). \n\nThis gene-disease relationship was originally evaluated by the ClinGen Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy GCEP on January 17, 2017. It was re-evaluated on March 10, 2022. As a result of this recuration, the classification changed from the original No Known Disease Relationship (formerly No reported Evidence) to Disputed. In summary, the evidence supporting the relationship between *CACNB2* and autosomal dominant Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy has been DISPUTED and no valid evidence remains to support the claim. More evidence is needed to either support or entirely refute the role *CACNB2* plays in HCM. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hereditary Cardiovascular Diseases GCEP on March 10, 2022.\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/84986ba2-f29a-4c59-b885-8870e43dc2b0","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e7a08ba4-6024-449c-b824-c762a85277a1","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","changes":[{"id":"cg:classificationChange"},{"id":"cg:newEvidence"},{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},{"id":"cg:expertPanelChange"},{"id":"cg:sopChange"},{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e7a08ba4-6024-449c-b824-c762a85277a1_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10104","date":"2022-05-10T16:12:18.227Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e7a08ba4-6024-449c-b824-c762a85277a1_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10104","date":"2022-04-13T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"CACNB2 has no known cases where a variant is associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy without being complicated by a variant significantly more likely to be causing the phenotypes, such as MYBPC3, and supported by segregation evidence.
