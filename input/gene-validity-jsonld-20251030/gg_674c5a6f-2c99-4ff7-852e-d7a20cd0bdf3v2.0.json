They reported a female with severe intellectual disability carrying a de novo X;9 translocation disrupting ZNF81 on chromosome X and EHMT1 on chromosome 9. Variants in EHMT1 cause an autosomal dominant intellectual disability syndrome (Kleefstra syndrome), so this translocation cannot be used as evidence.  Sequencing of ZNF81 in families with X-linked intellectual disability identified a missense variant in affected males within a multigenerational pedigree. This variant is present in gnomAD (v2.1.1) 18 times (including 6 males) and was not scored as evidence. No other genetic variants have been reported. In summary, there is no valid genetic evidence supporting the association between ZNF81 and non-syndromic X-linked intellectual disability, so this gene-disease relationship is disputed. Of note, this gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the Intellectual Disability and Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel on 06/28/2018, and reevaluated on 01/26/2021. As a result of this reevaluation, the original classification of “disputed” did not change. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel on 01/26/2021 (SOP Version 8).
