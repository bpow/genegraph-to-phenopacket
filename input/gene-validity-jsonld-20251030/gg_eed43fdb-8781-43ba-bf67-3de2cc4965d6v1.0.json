{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/eed43fdb-8781-43ba-bf67-3de2cc4965d6v1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"The DNAAF5 gene was first reported in relation to primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) in 2012 (Horani et al., PMID: 23040496). The PCD phenotype results from structural and/or functional abnormalities of motile cilia and flagella. Ciliary motility is powered by a set of axoneme-specific dynein motor complexes. The cytoplasmic assembly of these large multiprotein complexes before their transport into cilia is assisted by dynein axonemal assembly factors (DNAAFs). Mutations in genes encoding DNAAFs result in the improper cytoplasmic preassembly of dynein chains, causing defects in both inner (IDA) and outer dynein arms (ODA) that can result in cilia immotility (PMID: 31624012). Horani e tal. report a homozygous missense variant in 9 related individuals with suspected PCD from geographically dispersed Amish communities presenting with situs inversus totalis, neonatal respiratory distress, and bronchiectasis, amongst other PCD complications. Transmission electron microscopy of patient cilia showed absent inner and outer dynein arms. Diggle et al. (2014) report a second family with a homozygous splice donor variant. In this family, patients show classic PCD symptoms including neonatal respiratory distress, bronchiectasis and situs inversus totalis. Electron microscopy also revealed absence of both IDA and ODA.\nEvidence from 19 probands from 4 publications have been included in this curation representing 6 unique variants (2 missense, 1 splice donor and 3 frameshift). The mechanism of pathogenicity in DNAAF5 mutations appears to be biallelic loss of function, characterised in some cases by the absence of a gene product (PMID: 23040496). However, a C500F missense variant has been described as a mild variant, shown to retain some function. With the available evidence, we reached 9.2 points for the genetic evidence of this curation. All probands scored in this curation harboured two variant alleles within the DNAAF5 locus.\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by multiple forms of experimental evidence such as localisation to the cytoplasm and expression during early ciliogenesis in control human respiratory cilia (PMID: 23040496, 25232951). DNAAF5 is highly expressed in developing multiple motile cilia where ODA and IDA components are predominantly cytoplasmic, whereas lower levels of DNAAF5 are observed in fully mature multiple motile cilia where ODA and IDA components are exclusively axonemal, demonstrating a role in ODA and IDA assembly. In addition, functional studies performed on human tracheal epithelial cells cultured at air-liquid interface (ALI) have shown that DNAAF5 has a role in an early phase of expression of preassembly proteins, along with SPAG1 and DNAAF2. This phase is independent of MCIDAS regulation and precedes the expression of FOXJ1 (PMID: 29358401). An shRNA lentiviral knock-down model in human tracheal and bronchial epithelial cells shows that DNAAF5 results in an absence of ODA and absent or truncated IDA, as well as impaired ciliary motility (PMID: 23040496). Lastly, there are animal models that support this gene-disease evidence, including a Chlamydomonas reinhardtii knock-down model which results in absent ODA and IDA, and a reduced ciliary beat frequency to 41% of wild-type (PMID: 23040496), a mouse model showing hydrocephaly, early lethality, absence of ODA and IDA and reduced ciliary beat frequency (PMID: 37104040), and a Drosophila model which shows absence of ODA and IDA as well as infertility in male flies (PMID: 25232951). \nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting a gene-disease relationship between variants in DNAAF5 and Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia 18. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Motile Ciliopathy GCEP on May 9, 2024 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/eed43fdb-8781-43ba-bf67-3de2cc4965d6","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9b47c717-e0a5-43ce-865b-0b14289216d7","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9b47c717-e0a5-43ce-865b-0b14289216d7_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10102","date":"2024-06-19T10:25:53.200Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9b47c717-e0a5-43ce-865b-0b14289216d7_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10102","date":"2024-06-19T11:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9b47c717-e0a5-43ce-865b-0b14289216d7_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9b47c717-e0a5-43ce-865b-0b14289216d7_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2f31968f-4f81-4e17-8d17-556a14329e89","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Chlamydomonas models do not model lung issues or laterality defects.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9c721abb-1133-43d2-9384-1dc750ae9a72","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Chlre4 is the Chlamydomonas ortholog of human DNAAF5.
