Autosomal recessive pathogenic variants in *TRAF3IP1* are associated with Senior-Loken Syndrome 9 (OMIM: 616629) and broader ciliopathies, including Short-Rib Polydactyly Syndrome Type II (MONDO:0005308). Based on the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group criteria, these entities were classified under \"autosomal recessive ciliopathies\" due to shared molecular mechanisms, inheritance patterns, and overlapping phenotypes. The mechanism is biallelic loss-of-function, resulting in ciliary defects presenting as syndromic ciliopathies, including nephronophthisis, retinal degeneration, and skeletal or hepatic abnormalities.\n\nAt least 10 *TRAF3IP1* variants, including protein-truncating and missense mutations, have been reported in the literature, associated with ciliopathy phenotypes such as nephronophthisis, retinal degeneration, and polydactyly (PMIDs: 26487268, 29068549). Segregation and functional studies confirm that loss-of-function is the primary pathogenic mechanism. Functional evidence demonstrates impaired ciliary trafficking and microtubule stability caused by these variants (PMID: 26487268). Traf3ip1-knockout mouse embryos recapitulate lethal ciliopathy-related phenotypes due to disrupted ciliogenesis, cell size regulation, and Sonic Hedgehog signaling (PMID: 21945076). Furthermore, wild-type *TRAF3IP1* mRNA partially rescues ciliopathy-associated phenotypes in zebrafish, such as body axis curvature, pronephric cysts, and retinal degeneration, whereas patient-specific constructs fail to rescue these defects (PMID: 26487268).This gene-disease relationship is supported by comprehensive genetic evidence (10.2/12 points) and experimental evidence (6/6 points). \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *TRAF3IP1* and autosomal recessive ciliopathies. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Kidney Cystic and Ciliopathy Disorders GCEP on 11/27/2024 (SOP Version 10).\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/abd48810-6ba9-43df-9eeb-99e14be5ab4e","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e5e570ae-a273-44fc-81a4-28464f3f399f","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"},"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e5e570ae-a273-44fc-81a4-28464f3f399f_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10066","date":"2024-01-29T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e5e570ae-a273-44fc-81a4-28464f3f399f_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10066","date":"2025-07-16T14:17:14.972Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["ErrorClarification"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e5e570ae-a273-44fc-81a4-28464f3f399f_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e5e570ae-a273-44fc-81a4-28464f3f399f_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/86d66117-01b1-459b-a56c-02cb47ad93bb","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4888ed36-f8c1-4aa8-a9a0-840078dd7d7a","type":"Finding","dc:description":"IFT54 acts as a core subunit of the IFT-B complex, facilitating protein transport within the cilium.
