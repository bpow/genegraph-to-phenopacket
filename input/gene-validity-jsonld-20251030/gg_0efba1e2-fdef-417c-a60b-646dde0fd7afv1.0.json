KDF1-related tooth agenesis with or without ectodermal dysplasia is characterized by tooth agenesis; however some patients may also display variable ectodermal dysplasia. 8 unique missense variants that have been reported in 8 probands in 8 publications (PMIDs: 27838789, 30384154, 30977908, 35641834, 36293320, 37144643, 38501196, 40554824) are included in this curation. The mechanism of pathogenicity is thought to be gain of function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by animal models, expression studies, protein-protein interactions, functional alteration in patient cells, and biochemical function (PMIDs: 24075906, 30384154, 32239614, 36293320, 36831017). In summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between KDF1 and AD KDF1-related tooth agenesis with or without ectodermal dysplasia. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Craniofacial Malformations GCEP on the meeting date March 20th, 2025 (SOP Version 11).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0efba1e2-fdef-417c-a60b-646dde0fd7af","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/01768f27-57ea-401c-9e99-0b31109e371d","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/01768f27-57ea-401c-9e99-0b31109e371d_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10059","date":"2025-07-11T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/01768f27-57ea-401c-9e99-0b31109e371d_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10059","date":"2025-07-11T20:01:39.466Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/01768f27-57ea-401c-9e99-0b31109e371d_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ee46f4e7-5d1e-4e71-be2d-0ded5208a158","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ee46f4e7-5d1e-4e71-be2d-0ded5208a158_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"The expression of mutant F251L, I275L, and R303P proteins was increased compared to the WT protein, while obvious reductions in expression were observed in cells containing the I304A mutant (Pan et al. 2022, PMID: 35641834)","functionalDataSupport":"Yes"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ee46f4e7-5d1e-4e71-be2d-0ded5208a158_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35641834","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6b340891-565f-4aae-9859-95f5d21887f0","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_152365.3(KDF1):c.911T>A (p.Ile304Asn)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA339159258"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:DeNovoAlleleOrigin"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:Heterozygous"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/70517648-02af-4340-9067-1958c6bef132","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/70517648-02af-4340-9067-1958c6bef132_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"p.His254Tyr associated with increased expression of NF-κB target genes such as TNF and IL1B.
