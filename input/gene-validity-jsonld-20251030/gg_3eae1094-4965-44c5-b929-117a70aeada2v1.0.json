{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3eae1094-4965-44c5-b929-117a70aeada2v1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"The ENPP1 gene is located on chromosome 6 at 6q23.2 and encodes the ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 1 protein, which catalyzes the hydrolysis of ATP to AMP to produce extracellular inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi), which inhibits bone mineralization and soft tissue calcification. ENPP1 was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant hypopigmentation-punctate palmoplantar keratoderma syndrome, or Cole disease, in 2013 (Eytan et al. 2013, PMID: 24075184). This disorder is characterized by early-onset punctate keratoderma associated with irregularly shaped hypopigmented macules that typically occur on the limbs but not usually on the trunk. Calcinosis cutis and early-onset calcific tendinopathy are also reported. ENPP1 has also been associated with autosomal recessive generalized arterial calcification of infancy 1 by Rutsch et al. in 2003 (PMID: 12881724). Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, there is a difference in inheritance pattern and in clinical phenotype. Therefore, the diseases were split into hypopigmentation-punctate palmoplantar keratoderma syndrome (OMIM: 615522) and generalized arterial calcification of infancy 1 (OMIM: 208000). The split curation for autosomal recessive generalized arterial calcification of infancy 1, which also includes autosomal recessive hypophosphatemic rickets and pseudoxanthoma elasticum, has been curated separately. \nEvidence supporting the relationship between ENPP1 and hypopigmentation-punctate palmoplantar keratoderma syndrome includes case-level data. Seven unique missense variants, all impacting conserved cysteine residues within the somatomedin-B-like (SMB) domains that have been reported in 11 families in five publications are included in this curation (PMID: 24075184; Schlipf et al. 2016, PMID: 26617416; Chourabi et al. 2018, PMID: 28964717; Gabaton et al. 2020; PMID: 32598042; Li et al. 2021, PMID: 34297442; Nanda et al. 2022, PMID: 35220637). Reduced penetrance is suggested in one family (PMID: 26617416) and the disorder appears to follow an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern in three families (PMID: 28964717). This gene-disease relationship is not supported by gene-level experimental evidence.\nIn summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Syndromic Disorders Gene Curation Expert Panel on the meeting date 06.17.2022 (SOP Version 8).\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3eae1094-4965-44c5-b929-117a70aeada2","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ed97faaf-d5ce-4da2-8367-b6fb51a57cbf","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ed97faaf-d5ce-4da2-8367-b6fb51a57cbf_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10060","date":"2024-10-08T20:06:39.230Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ed97faaf-d5ce-4da2-8367-b6fb51a57cbf_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10060","date":"2022-06-17T04:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ed97faaf-d5ce-4da2-8367-b6fb51a57cbf_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ed97faaf-d5ce-4da2-8367-b6fb51a57cbf_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8e74a56f-a5b0-4d43-a6b8-9c74fbf09d7f","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Structural modeling showed Arg176 would form hydrogen bonds with nearby residues, disrupting protein folding.","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8e74a56f-a5b0-4d43-a6b8-9c74fbf09d7f_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34297442","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d421d21d-1587-4aa1-84b8-b7570519a161","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_006208.3(ENPP1):c.526T>C (p.Cys176Arg)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA365662115"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Heterozygous"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":0.25},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/eae57bee-2d4a-4c7f-a2c9-e95160ccf14c","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"All affected individuals tested carried missense variants at highly conserved cysteine residues in the SMB2 domain; structural modeling indicates all 3 variants would disrupt disulphide bonding","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/eae57bee-2d4a-4c7f-a2c9-e95160ccf14c_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24075184","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/44eb254c-fb58-4da4-8984-5c1a7e53c70e","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_006208.3(ENPP1):c.446G>C (p.Cys149Ser)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA145332"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Heterozygous"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":0.25},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4f1a8d96-f044-427a-9ff6-5caebaa4cf02","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Authors suggest this is a founder variant.
