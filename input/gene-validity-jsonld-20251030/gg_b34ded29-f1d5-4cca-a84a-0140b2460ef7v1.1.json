A missense variant causing the aminoacid substitution Arg154His was identified in one patient. This previously report variant is classified as likely pathogenic according to current ACMG criteria and has been demonstrate in vitro to disturb the binding of this protein to myosin. However, this variant has not been linked to ARVC phenotype and no segregation data were available.\nIn the second study (22421524) 14 ARVC patients were investigated but no MYL3 variants were reported.\nThere is no clear evidence that the identified MYL3 contribute to the ARVC phenotype and there is no known disease mechanism that would link MYL3 with ARVC.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b34ded29-f1d5-4cca-a84a-0140b2460ef7","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b1d5e9bf-ca57-445a-a432-27fe221484bf","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b1d5e9bf-ca57-445a-a432-27fe221484bf_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10003","date":"2020-10-12T17:43:07.505Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b1d5e9bf-ca57-445a-a432-27fe221484bf_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10003","date":"2019-09-13T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b1d5e9bf-ca57-445a-a432-27fe221484bf_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b1d5e9bf-ca57-445a-a432-27fe221484bf_ad_other_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ceea750f-f42b-48d3-9703-6bb59c8ef49f_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"No segregation data","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e5b34878-9f71-4499-af4d-d0d1b9a78a5c","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29709087","rdfs:label":"6","ageType":"AgeAtDiagnosis","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":36,"detectionMethod":"","firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"Screening for Desmosomal genes and TMEM43-PLN-SCN5A variants","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ceea750f-f42b-48d3-9703-6bb59c8ef49f_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29709087","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0c24fe95-6681-46b5-b95e-5db1974ce435","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000258.2(MYL3):c.461G>A (p.Arg154His)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA013861"}}}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.25}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalDominantOtherVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.25}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.25},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b1d5e9bf-ca57-445a-a432-27fe221484bf_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0}],"evidenceStrength":"Limited","sequence":1325,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria7","strengthScore":0.25,"subject":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/YSyKtDH8_SQ","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0016587","gene":"hgnc:7584","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"1.1","websiteLegacyID":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/assertion_b1d5e9bf-ca57-445a-a432-27fe221484bf-","@context":{"@vocab":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"},"curationReasons":{"@type":"@vocab","@container":"@set"},"GCISnapshot":{"@type":"@id"},"dc:isVersionOf":{"@type":"@id"},"websiteLegacyID":{"@type":"@id"}}}
