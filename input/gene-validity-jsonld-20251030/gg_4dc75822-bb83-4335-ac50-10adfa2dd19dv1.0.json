Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we have found differences in molecular mechanism, inheritance pattern, and phenotypic variability for this gene. Therefore, this curation has been split into multiple entities: autosomal dominant self-limited familial neonatal epilepsy (MONDO:0100023; thought to be loss of function), autosomal dominant complex neurodevelopmental disorder (MONDO:0100038; thought to be gain of function), and autosomal recessive developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (MONDO:0100062, mechanism unclear). These split curations have been curated separately by the Epilepsy GCEP and this entry will only cover autosomal recessive developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (AR-DEE) (MONDO:0100062). \n\n*KCNQ3* was first reported in relation to AR-DEE in 2018 by Kothur et al. (PMID: 29852413) when a homozygous frameshift variant was detected in a male proband with familial neonatal seizures, hypotonia, and severe intellectual disability (ID). Subsequently in 2019, Lauritano et al. (PMID: 31440727) reported a different homozygous frameshift variant detected in a female proband with moderate intellectual disability (ID) and generalized convulsions associated with hypotonia, cyanosis, and clonic movements of the four limbs. Both probands were born to consanguineous parents. Of note, in PMID 29852413, patients in the same family reported clinical heterogeneity characterized by variable degrees of ID and the presentation of seizures. \n\nIn summary, *KCNQ3* has limited association with autosomal recessive developmental and epileptic encephalopathy. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This was approved by the ClinGen Epilepsy GCEP on 8/1/2023 (SOP v.9).\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4dc75822-bb83-4335-ac50-10adfa2dd19d","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/610858f1-e0cf-4db1-ae6c-95a1364b621e","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/610858f1-e0cf-4db1-ae6c-95a1364b621e_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10005","date":"2024-11-27T17:22:10.858Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/610858f1-e0cf-4db1-ae6c-95a1364b621e_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10005","date":"2023-08-01T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/610858f1-e0cf-4db1-ae6c-95a1364b621e_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/610858f1-e0cf-4db1-ae6c-95a1364b621e_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0562190a-a23f-41bc-80e2-e32dd16a919a_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f0b071ad-5816-4196-928a-91cd47d721cc","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":4,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f0b071ad-5816-4196-928a-91cd47d721cc_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"KCNQ3 transcript levels were markedly reduced (22%) in primary fibroblasts from the proband when compared to those from the unaffected noncarrier brother.
