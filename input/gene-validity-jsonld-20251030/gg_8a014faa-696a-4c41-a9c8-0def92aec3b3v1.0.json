{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8a014faa-696a-4c41-a9c8-0def92aec3b3v1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"The relationship between *ATP5MK* and primary mitochondrial disease was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of April 15, 2024. The *ATP5MK* gene (alternate names include *ATP5MD*, *USMG5*, and *DAPIT*) encodes a subunit of the mitochondrial ATP synthase, also known as complex V of the oxidative phosphorylation system. Defects of this protein lead to a reduction of ATP synthesis.\n\nThe first and only report of *ATP5MK*-related autosomal recessive primary mitochondrial disease was in 2018 (PMID: 29917077), in three probands from unrelated Ashkenazi Jewish families. The three probands all presented with Leigh syndrome spectrum disorder and were homozygous for the same intronic variant, c.87+1G>C, which impacts splicing and is proposed to be a founder variant. While various names have been given to the constellation of features seen in those with *ATP5MK*-related disorders, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *ATP5MK* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework. Of note, *ATP5MK* was first curated by this Expert Panel for its association with Leigh syndrome spectrum (LSS) on July 13, 2020 (SOP V7), with a final classification of Moderate. This current curation for the association with primary mitochondrial disease includes the three cases included in the LSS curation.\n\nEvidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. \n\nThe mechanism of disease is loss of function. This gene-disease association is also supported by the known biochemical function of ATP5MK as a structural subunit of complex V, as well as functional alteration in HeLa cells (PMID: 21345788), *Drosophila* models (PMID: 29234032), and rescue in patient cells (PMID: 29917077). Of note, a mouse model exists but was not included in this curation due to limited phenotype information and incomplete penetrance (PMID: 28650483).\n\nIn summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on April 15, 2024 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8a014faa-696a-4c41-a9c8-0def92aec3b3","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1b48db69-0e48-47b6-bbd3-4c09ade82a73","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1b48db69-0e48-47b6-bbd3-4c09ade82a73_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2025-02-04T21:14:23.940Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1b48db69-0e48-47b6-bbd3-4c09ade82a73_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2024-04-15T04:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1b48db69-0e48-47b6-bbd3-4c09ade82a73_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1b48db69-0e48-47b6-bbd3-4c09ade82a73_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/59cd2b0e-60fe-4232-bdf1-34161cd3e1b2","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Score
