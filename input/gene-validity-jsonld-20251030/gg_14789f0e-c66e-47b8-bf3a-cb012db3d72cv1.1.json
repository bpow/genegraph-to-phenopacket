At least one missense variant has been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, and expression data. Of note, this gene has also been implicated in autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss. This has been assessed separately. Summary of Case Level Data: 0.5 POINTS. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 1 proband in 1 publication and segregated with disease in 4 additional family members (Li et al., PMID: 29713870). This gene-disease association is supported by expression studies. Of note, the heterozygous *ELMOD3* null mouse does not display a phenotype and was not scored. (Li et al 2019 PMID:31628468). In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hearing Loss Gene Curation Expert Panel on the meeting date 11.17.21 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/14789f0e-c66e-47b8-bf3a-cb012db3d72c","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/86999665-43b6-4824-b5e5-81b2a6dd8034","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","changes":{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/86999665-43b6-4824-b5e5-81b2a6dd8034_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2021-12-31T19:07:50.043Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/86999665-43b6-4824-b5e5-81b2a6dd8034_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2021-11-17T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/86999665-43b6-4824-b5e5-81b2a6dd8034_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/86999665-43b6-4824-b5e5-81b2a6dd8034_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/363e844a-c442-48cd-b793-955ba9273945","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d73164ef-c56b-4613-bd08-7167cd26cf31","type":"Finding","dc:description":"ELMOD3 was present in mouse cochlea by western blot","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31628468","rdfs:label":"Li_Expression ","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/86999665-43b6-4824-b5e5-81b2a6dd8034_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/84af927b-c005-43eb-a022-d57f00840fc9","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Heterozygous mice were evaluated up to two months of age and did not display any hearing loss.
