The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss-of-function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence (expression-level data; PMID: 28880281). Expression-level data in chick and mouse embryos shows expression in the posterior heart poles and left and right sinus horns. In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Congenital Heart Disease GCEP on the meeting date 10/01/24 (SOP Version 11).\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4835d8e3-fcf3-4e11-8f18-a88ca297b6cd","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4331c822-c5ff-4211-aef7-6004c99d95d1","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4331c822-c5ff-4211-aef7-6004c99d95d1_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10130","date":"2024-10-01T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4331c822-c5ff-4211-aef7-6004c99d95d1_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10130","date":"2024-11-26T01:18:21.052Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4331c822-c5ff-4211-aef7-6004c99d95d1_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/dbe2a544-cb52-4c1b-ab53-092ba3ef2bb1","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/dbe2a544-cb52-4c1b-ab53-092ba3ef2bb1_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30448225","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/395778ba-c567-4fe7-b177-49691a01406b","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_005985.4(SNAI1):c.671G>C
