At least 14 unique variants (e.g. missense and frameshift) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, and\nexperimental data. Summary of Case Level Data: 8 POINTS\nVariants in this gene have been reported in at least 17 probands in over 11 publications (PMIDs: 31285529, 19780765, 28255779, 25033742, 24596948, 15592994, 28454995, 31054490). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in at least 7 additional family members.\n\nThe mechanism for disease is homozygous or compound heterozygous loss of function variants (PMID: 31285529).  \n\nThis gene-disease association is supported by animal models, expression studies, and in vitro functional assays.\n\nIn summary, SLC22A25 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive epileptic encephalopathy This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ccc9a684-a0ad-4b86-ad54-462e186e95b1","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e9a7ba06-6ddf-4a94-a0df-0b6c164f72b9","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e9a7ba06-6ddf-4a94-a0df-0b6c164f72b9_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10005","date":"2020-05-19T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e9a7ba06-6ddf-4a94-a0df-0b6c164f72b9_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10005","date":"2021-06-02T13:36:53.442Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e9a7ba06-6ddf-4a94-a0df-0b6c164f72b9_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8773f1f1-a7a7-4892-8ac0-9c20b7bc7bd2_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Two missense variants in trans in a proband, identified by WES.
