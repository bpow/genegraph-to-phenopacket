MADD occurs in a neonatal onset (severe) form and a late onset (mild) form. In the severe form, hypotonia, hypoglycemia, metabolic acidosis and/or hyperammonemia are present with/without anomalies such as dysplastic kidney and/or congenital heart disease. Eightteen variants (including missense, in-frame deletions, nonsense, splicing, and frameshift) have been reported in 11 probands in 9 publications (PMIDs: 11420420, 7912128, 12706375, 12815589, 16510302, 27081516, 18289905, 36406819, 34573316) and are included in this curation. This gene-disease association is also supported by experimental evidence including its biochemical function as a subunit of electron transfer flavoprotein (PMID: 25416781) where it interacts with the additional disease-causing gene ETFA (PMID: 15159392), and the altered function found in patients (PMID: 12815589) which can be rescued with wildtype (PMID: 79121280), as well as an expression pattern consistent with disease (PMID: 8504797).  In summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between ETFB and autosomal recessive MADD. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.\n\nThis gene-disease pair was originally evaluated as Moderate by the FAO GCEP on 06/12/2018 and 12/16/2020.  It was reevaluated on 03/29/2023.  Additional genetic evidence was curated from new publications (PMIDs: 36406819, 34573316). As a result of this reevaluation, the classification increased to Definitive (SOPv9).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b372c7f6-bbac-488a-812a-0d27002e88a2","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d9a8d844-c82a-4258-bd48-10e2d977273e","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":[{"id":"cg:sopChange"},{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"},{"id":"cg:classificationChange"},{"id":"cg:newEvidence"},{"id":"cg:summaryChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d9a8d844-c82a-4258-bd48-10e2d977273e_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10010","date":"2023-05-23T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d9a8d844-c82a-4258-bd48-10e2d977273e_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10010","date":"2023-05-23T16:51:46.755Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d9a8d844-c82a-4258-bd48-10e2d977273e_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/02cb6640-8c4a-4160-97ed-9ba905b97dd9_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/02cb6640-8c4a-4160-97ed-9ba905b97dd9","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27081516","rdfs:label":"GAII patient","ageType":"AgeAtDeath","ageUnit":"Days","ageValue":6,"allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a9e0ea66-10c1-46ad-9d95-a319d1fcb685","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001014763.1(ETFB):c.416_418del (p.Glu139del)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA658795327"}},"detectionMethod":"Genomic DNA was extracted from the peripheral blood cells, PCR-amplified over all coding regions and sequenced.","firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"‘sweaty feet’ odor, cardiac dysfunction","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0005989","obo:HP_0000369","obo:HP_0001942","obo:HP_0000347","obo:HP_0000113","obo:HP_0003241","obo:HP_0001987","obo:HP_0001252","obo:HP_0003270","obo:HP_0002389","obo:HP_0006251","obo:HP_0001639","obo:HP_0001943"],"previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"ETFA was sequenced for potential causative variants.","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3e5587da-8c18-4a74-836d-af1e9e3743e4_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27081516","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a9e0ea66-10c1-46ad-9d95-a319d1fcb685"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:AlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"}}},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3e5587da-8c18-4a74-836d-af1e9e3743e4","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Authors speculate that the in-frame (Glu48del) mutation would drastically change the EFTB structure leading to a marked decrease in ETF/ETFDH enzyme activity, as seen for null mutations.
