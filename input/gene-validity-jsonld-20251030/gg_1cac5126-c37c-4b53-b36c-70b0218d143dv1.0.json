Over 18 variants (variant type, e.g. missense, in-frame indel, nonsense, frameshift, splice, etc) that have been reported in 20 probands in 10 publications (PMIDs:  30599236, 25205549, 24888602, 25524009, 28472507, 32813180, 30941118, 24140114, 25237204, 28778864 ) are included in this curation.  More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum\nscore for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be GOF, LOF, and DN. This gene-disease association is also supported by animal models, expression studies, in vitro functional assays, and cell culture models (PMIDs: 28778864, 19524538, 12374738, 17254973, 9432973, 26851215, 9432976). \nIn summary, NFKB2 is definitively associated with  autosomal dominant common variable immunodeficiency 10. This has\nbeen repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has\nbeen upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1cac5126-c37c-4b53-b36c-70b0218d143d","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/61b546f1-5683-4588-a5bc-030ebbd5b401","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/61b546f1-5683-4588-a5bc-030ebbd5b401_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10080","date":"2021-10-13T13:26:01.192Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/61b546f1-5683-4588-a5bc-030ebbd5b401_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10080","date":"2021-10-13T13:26:22.179Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/61b546f1-5683-4588-a5bc-030ebbd5b401_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6c0a4ec6-67cd-4364-829d-8c0d23d848ff","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Downgraded variant from 1.5 to 0.5 as the frameshift is located in the C-terminus and not predicted to undergo NMD.

To mimic the activation status of the noncanonical signaling pathway, they cotransfected NIK together with vectors expressing either the WT or mutant NFKB2 alleles. Western blots showed that WT-p100 protein was processed to the active form p52 upon cotransfection of NIK, whereas the mutant failed to produce phosphorylation preventing subsequent proteasomal processing into active p52.
