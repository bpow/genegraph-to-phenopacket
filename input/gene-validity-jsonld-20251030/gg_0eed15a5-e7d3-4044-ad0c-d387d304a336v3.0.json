At least 5 variants (e.g. large deletion, intronic, missense) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and\nexperimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 5 probands in 3 publications (PMIDs 21089064, 29122468, 37510312). This gene-disease association is supported by expression studies and in vitro functional assays. In summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged. This gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the Fatty Acid Oxidation Disorders GCEP on October 12, 2018. It was reevaluated on April 23, 2024. As a result of this reevaluation, the classification increased from Limited to Moderate with the addition of new cases (PMID: 37510312). This classification was approved by the ClinGen Fatty Acid Oxidation Disorders GCEP on April 23,2024 (SOP Version 10.1).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0eed15a5-e7d3-4044-ad0c-d387d304a336","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f44e2049-ade2-464c-a4e5-eaf851252082","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","changes":[{"id":"cg:classificationChange"},{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"},{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},{"id":"cg:newEvidence"},{"id":"cg:sopChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f44e2049-ade2-464c-a4e5-eaf851252082_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10010","date":"2024-04-25T20:54:59.682Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f44e2049-ade2-464c-a4e5-eaf851252082_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10010","date":"2024-04-25T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["RecurationTiming"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f44e2049-ade2-464c-a4e5-eaf851252082_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f44e2049-ade2-464c-a4e5-eaf851252082_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2084e421-d2dc-4a2f-85db-04b548c7d840","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7a8bcaa5-1414-413e-95f3-59224986a28a","type":"Finding","dc:description":"RT-PCR showed that mRNA was most abundantly expressed in the small intestine and placenta.
