More than ten pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants have been reported in humans per ClinVar. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Summary of case-level (12 pts) and experimental data (3.5 pts): 15.5 points. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 5 probands in 5 publications (PMID: 23105016, PMID: 27799409, PMID:33427402, PMID: 37789430, PMID: 34668366). The mechanism for disease is expected to be loss of function. This gene-disease association is supported by in vitro functional assays.\n\nAt the time of curation (April 2020), this gene did not have associated disease entities per OMIM, but subsequently \"Retinal dystrophy with leukodystrophy\" was added as the disease entity. There have been associations with retinal dystrophy (PMID:23105016) and ACBD5 deficiency (PMID:27799409) in the literature. Additionally, there has been a report of an association with autosomal dominant thrombocytopenia (PMID:20626622), but this was later disputed (PMID:21211618). Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no\ndifference in molecular mechanism, inheritance pattern, or phenotypic\nvariability among the reports of retinal dystrophy and ACBD5 deficiency. Therefore, all of the disease entities have been lumped into one disease entity, ACBD5 deficiency (MONDO:0100112).\n\nIn summary, *ACBD5* is definitively associated with ACBD5 deficiency. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. \n\nThis gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the Peroxisomal Disorders GCEP on April 20, 2022 as a moderate classification. It was reevaluated on May 2, 2024. As a result of this reevaluation, the classification was upgraded from Moderate to Definitive.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/83337c20-1bae-4e32-a81c-0b51be5f422b","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8ac052f6-de8d-4c14-adf2-bbecb624defd","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":[{"id":"cg:sopChange"},{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"},{"id":"cg:newEvidence"},{"id":"cg:classificationChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8ac052f6-de8d-4c14-adf2-bbecb624defd_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10049","date":"2024-06-21T18:13:48.448Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8ac052f6-de8d-4c14-adf2-bbecb624defd_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10049","date":"2024-06-21T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["RecurationNewEvidence"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8ac052f6-de8d-4c14-adf2-bbecb624defd_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a3fc150f-23b4-4dc4-a1f4-91b69540b160_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a3fc150f-23b4-4dc4-a1f4-91b69540b160","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27799409","rdfs:label":"ACBD5 deficient patient","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/351b2680-3d95-40ab-a626-7ae7a0388863","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NC_000010.11:g.27211314_27218871del (GRCh38)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA916079817"}},"detectionMethod":"PCR and Sanger sequencing of ACBD5, parents tested and reported to be heterozygous for variant","firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypeFreeText":"cleft palate noted to be syndromic, born full term, pregnancy complicated by gestational diabetes, walked independently at 1yo, began speaking at 2yo, preserved cognitive function, limited vocabulary apparent at 2yo, normal hearing, tubular nose, increased extrapyramidal and pyramidal tone in arms and legs, developed difficulty with walking, descending stairs, had decreased endurance with increased falling and by 9yo could only walk with assistance/walker, MRI showed diffuse T2 signal abnormality in deep white matter and long tracts in brainstem (pyramidal tracts, medial lemniscus, inferior cerebellar peduncles)\n\nBlood biochemical parameters: C26:0 lysoPCa (nmol/l) = 166, C26-carnitinea (μmol/l) = 0.099, C26:0b (μg/ml) = 0.43, C26:0/C22:0= 0.025, C24:0/C22:0 = 1.29\n\nFibroblasts biochemical parameters (umol/g): C22:0 = 3.01/4.40, C24:0= 7.65/9.23, C26:0/C22:0 = 0.35/0.26, C24:0/C22:0 = 2.54/2.10, C26:0 lysoPC = 32, Phytanic acid alpha-oxidation = 31pmol/(hr.mg), Pristanic acid beta-oxidation = 1086pmol/(hr.mg), C26:0 beta-oxidation = 437pmol/(hr.mg), DHAPAT (nmol/(2h.mg)) = 9.8, ACOX1 (pmol/(min.mg)) = 285, DBP hydratase (pmol/(min.mg)) = 143, DBP dehydrogenase (pmol/(min.mg)) = 54, SCPx (pmol/(min.mg)) = 20","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0000175","obo:HP_0003391","obo:HP_0002136","obo:HP_0001488","obo:HP_0000601","obo:HP_0030147","obo:HP_0001310","obo:HP_0001270","obo:HP_0000253","obo:HP_0002515","obo:HP_0002317","obo:HP_0002355","obo:HP_0003701","obo:HP_0002415","obo:HP_0001251","obo:HP_0000411","obo:HP_0008167","obo:HP_0008376","obo:HP_0003429","obo:HP_0000556","obo:HP_0001999","obo:HP_0001583"],"previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"acyl-CoA oxidase 1 deficiency and X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy ruled out by Sanger sequencing of ACOX1 and ABCD1","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6e60c870-8a42-4e1b-a9e0-9e1a70560c7c_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27799409","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/351b2680-3d95-40ab-a626-7ae7a0388863"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"No","zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"}}},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6e60c870-8a42-4e1b-a9e0-9e1a70560c7c","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Actual variant in the paper also describes the insertion of an inverted sequence: NM_145698.4:c.626-689_937-234delins936+1075_936+1230inv.
