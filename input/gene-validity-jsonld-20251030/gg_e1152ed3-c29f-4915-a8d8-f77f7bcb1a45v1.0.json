At least 5 variants (missense and nonsense) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level and experimental data, including protein interaction, biochemical function, and tissue expression.\n\nVariants in this gene have been reported in at least 5 probands in 4 publications (PMIDs: 29843651, 33187088, 31661308, 30578383). The mechanism for disease is haploinsufficiency.\n\nThe gene-disease association is supported by data demonstrating protein interaction, biochemical function and tissue expression (PMIDs: 17068149, 29789425, 31661308). In summary, BMP10 currently has limited evidence supporting a gene-disease relationship with autosomal dominant pulmonary arterial hypertension.

ALK1 is mainly expressed in arterial endothelial cells and likely can play a role in the development of both disorders.
