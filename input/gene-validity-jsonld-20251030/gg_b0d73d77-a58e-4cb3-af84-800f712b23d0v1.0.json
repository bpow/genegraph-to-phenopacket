At least 36 unique variants including missense, in-frame indel, nonsense, frameshift, and large deletions have been reported in humans. HPS1 is involved in organelle biogenesis associated with melanosomes, platelet dense granules, and lysosomes. Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome 1 is characterized by severe oculocutaneous albinism and a bleeding diathesis, but in some cases, also pulmonary fibrosis and granulomatous colitis. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data.  \n  \nSummary of Case Level Data: 12 Points \nVariants in this gene have been reported in at least 10 probands in 4 publications (PMIDs: 8896559, 9497254, 9705234, 27593200). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. \n  \nThe mechanism for disease is homozygous loss of function (PMID: 9256466)  \t \n  \nSummary of Experimental Data: 5.5 Points \nThis gene-disease association is supported by mouse models and in vitro functional assays. The \"pale ear\" or ep mouse that carries a spontaneously occurring mutation in Hps1 recapitulates the human HPS phenotype (PMID: 9256466, 9158155). HPS1 interacts with HPS4 to form BLOC-3, which is involved in the biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles (PMID: 12847290, 29190429, 25468649).  \n\nIn summary, HPS1 is definitively associated with Autosomal Recessive Hermasky-Pudlak syndrome 1. \nThis has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hemostasis/Thrombosis GCEP on June 26, 2019 (SOP Version 6).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b0d73d77-a58e-4cb3-af84-800f712b23d0","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f6d44a89-527f-4864-a1e1-dcd0a17000ca","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f6d44a89-527f-4864-a1e1-dcd0a17000ca_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2019-07-22T14:28:42.174Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f6d44a89-527f-4864-a1e1-dcd0a17000ca_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f6d44a89-527f-4864-a1e1-dcd0a17000ca_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fcbc2495-02e6-46d3-809d-731ff3194a99_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The proband was homozygous for the 4-bp duplication that causes a frameshift and early termination of translation at amino acid position, 582.
