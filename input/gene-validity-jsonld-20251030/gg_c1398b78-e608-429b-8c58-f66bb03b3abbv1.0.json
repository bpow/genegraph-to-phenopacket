The *PUS1* gene encodes pseudouridine synthase 1, which functions in mitochondrial transcript processing and modification. \n\nThe *PUS1* gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive primary mitochondrial disease in 2004 (PMID: 15108122) when the molecular defects in families whose phenotype was described as a new syndrome of myopathy, lactic acidosis, and sideroblastic anemia (MLASA) in 1995 (PMID: 7726239) were identified. While various names have been given to the constellation of features seen in those with *PUS1*-related disease, including autosomal recessive MLASA (MIM 600462), pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *PUS1* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included five unique variants (four stop-gained variants, one frameshift variant, and one missense variant) identified in five individuals from five publications (PMIDs: 15108122, 17056637, 19731322, 25058219, 26556812). Additional evidence is available in the literature (PMIDs: 15971356, 28832011, 25227147), but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of disease appears to be loss of function. The c.885C>T (p.Arg144Trp) variant is recognized as a founder variant in the Middle Eastern Jewish population. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by a biochemical function (mitochondrial RNA processing for translation) shared with other genes associated with primary mitochondrial disease and recapitulation of the myopathy and mitochondrial dysfunction in muscle observed in human patients in a knockout mouse model (PMID: 27197761). \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between *PUS1* and autosomal recessive primary mitochondrial disease. This relationship has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on August 1, 2022 (SOP Version 9).

Cytochrome c oxidase activity was significantly reduced in extracts from red gastrocnemius muscle from Pus1−/− mice. Transmission electron microscopy on red gastrocnemius muscle demonstrated that Pus1−/− mice also had lower intermyofibrillar mitochondrial density and smaller mitochondria. However, in contrast to MLASA patients, there appears to be no overt hematological phenotype in Pus1p deficient mice. Certain pseudouridine modifications were missing in cytoplasmic and mitochondrial tRNAs from Pus1−/− animals. Absence of Pus1p activity in the Pus1−/− mice was confirmed via pseudouridinylation assays (Fig. 2).\nrecapitulation of myopathy and mitochondrial dysfunction in muscle but not anemia","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/28cd91f2-ff5c-4bb0-a633-3123dbdd5b56","type":"Finding","dc:description":"recapitulation of myopathy and mitochondrial dysfunction in muscle but not anemia","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27197761","rdfs:label":"KO mouse model","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/821f6d18-025f-477b-8ba2-b4aad502670c_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c494a13e-c65f-43d3-8f8f-1371de7b46f0","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"scored according to rubric; >10 genes","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ceddb1fd-acaf-4048-a64c-808827f0f2d3","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Encodes pseudouridine (Ψ) synthase 1 (Pus1p), which is responsible for the pseudouridination of tRNA species in both the mitochondrion and cytoplasm.

A slight prevalence of type I fibers and a marked and diffuse increase of acid phosphatase activity were observed. Perls’ Prussian blue staining showed iron overload in scattered fibers (Fig. 3). Activities of Respiratory Chain complexes (RCs) I, II, III, II + III, and IV and of citrate synthase were all normal in cultured myoblasts. mtDNA copy number in muscle biopsy was increased almost twofold the values found in normal controls (Fig. 4).
