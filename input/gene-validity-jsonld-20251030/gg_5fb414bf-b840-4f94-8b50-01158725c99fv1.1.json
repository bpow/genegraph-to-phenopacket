TRDN encodes Triadin, a protein important for calcium-release regulation from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Biallelic loss of function variants in TRDN have been described in CPVT patients in a number of studies (Roux-Buisson et al, 2012, PMID:22422768; Rooryck et al, 2015, PMID:26200674; Walsh et al, 2016, PMID:26768964), including nonsense (p.Gln205Ter, p.Glu168Ter), frameshift (c.53_56del), intronic (c.22+29A>G, with effect on splicing functionally proven) and missense (p.Thr59Arg, the mutant protein was confirmed to be degraded in COS-7 cells and after transfection into knockout mice) variants. An additional report described a homozygous deletion of TRDN exon 2 in an infant who suffered cardiac arrest and subsequent arrhythmia episodes, but this case was scored with only one point due to uncertainty about the phenotype and the additional presence of a RYR2 variant of uncertain significance in this patient (O'Callaghan et al, 2018, PMID:30479949). Biallelic truncating variants in TRDN have also been reported in patients with Long QT syndrome, and the LQTS Gene Curation Expert Panel have previously classified TRDN as having strong evidence for association with LQTS, though with an atypical LQTS phenotype. The variable and atypical phenotypes associated with so-called “Triadin knockout syndrome” should therefore be taken into account when interpreting patients with TRDN biallelic loss of function variants. The association of TRDN with CPVT is also supported by substantial experimental evidence, including expression in heart tissue (Cacheux et al, 2019, PMID:31607542), protein interaction with RYR2 and CASQ2 (Guo et al, 1996, PMID:8550602) and relevant biochemical function in regulating the contractile properties of the heart (Kirchhefer et al, 2001, PMID:11069905). Additionally, knockout mice are directly relevant to the genotypes observed in CPVT patients with TRDN variants, with several studies demonstrating a relevant CPVT phenotype in knockout mice for non-human model organism (e.g. Cacheux et al, 2019, PMID:31607542; Chopra et al, 2009, PMID:19383796) and functional alteration in non-patient cells derived from these mouse knockouts (Chopra et al, 2009, PMID:19383796). Partial rescue of the CPVT phenotype has also been observed in knockout mice treated with AAV2/9 virus encoding rat TRDN isoform Trisk32 (Cacheux et al, 2019, PMID:31607542). In summary, TRDN variants are definitively associated with autosomal recessive CPVT. Note: All CPVT genes were curated by 3 separate blinded teams. The evidence and scores reached by these 3 teams was reviewed by the CPVT Gene Curation Expert Panel (GCEP). The classification and summary presented here is the conclusion of this GCEP's analysis according to evidence teams' efforts. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia Gene Curation Expert Panel on 20th January, 2021 (SOP Version 7).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5fb414bf-b840-4f94-8b50-01158725c99f","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a86167e8-9010-488d-b5bb-1f29e805bd91","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a86167e8-9010-488d-b5bb-1f29e805bd91_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10074","date":"2021-04-22T19:09:50.472Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a86167e8-9010-488d-b5bb-1f29e805bd91_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10074","date":"2021-01-20T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a86167e8-9010-488d-b5bb-1f29e805bd91_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ca62498a-4fe7-4852-9535-f6dc068c2e0c_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ad65646b-cf1f-4813-8c63-38ce83bc0ba8","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22422768","rdfs:label":"Family 1: II-1 ","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":2,"detectionMethod":"Sanger sequencing of all exons encoding the human TRDN isoform Trisk32, as well as RYR2 and CASQ2.","firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001695","obo:HP_0001279","obo:HP_0031677","obo:HP_0006682"],"sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ca62498a-4fe7-4852-9535-f6dc068c2e0c_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22422768","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6fb80d11-c72d-4e52-9c75-5330cca5b5cc","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_006073.4(TRDN):c.53_56del (p.Asp18fs)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA3984487"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"none"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/316f125f-2691-46f4-ac46-faddc23bbe63_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c44d24ea-b772-4c74-8518-45e95fc951b9","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26200674","rdfs:label":"II-1","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":5,"detectionMethod":"NGS panel targeting 45 genes implicated in cardiac arrhythmias (CPVT, Brugada, long QT, ARVC).","firstTestingMethod":"Next generation sequencing panels","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001279","obo:HP_0006682"],"sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/316f125f-2691-46f4-ac46-faddc23bbe63_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26200674","allele":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/72e390b5-a50a-488b-b3ef-bd304f9f260f","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NC_000006.12:g.123636725T>C (GRCh38)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA3984519"}},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d0bafa58-27e0-459c-9986-386c1576a7b5","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_006073.4(TRDN):c.613C>T (p.Gln205Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA144820"}}],"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"none"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9a1b4ddb-6d97-4bb7-9bca-80fc7d57a268_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Although the deletion of the entire exon 2 of TRDN de facto corresponds to a TRDN-null (probably making TRDN unavailable to interact with RYR2 and CASQ2), there are other two potentially pathogenic variants carried by the proband.
