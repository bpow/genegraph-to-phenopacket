Heterozygous de novo rare missense variants in *KCNH1* are reported in individuals with a clinical diagnosis of Temple-Baraitser syndrome whose features include ID, epilepsy, hypoplasia/aplasia of the nails of the thumb and great toe (PMID: 25420144), Zimmermann-Laband syndrome  which is characterized by ID, hypoplasia of nails and terminal phalanges, facial dysmorphism, gingival enlargement, hypertrichosis (PMID: 25915598), and in individuals with non-syndromic ID with or without epilepsy (PMID: 33811134). Due to phenotypic overlap of these clinical entities, shared missense variants observed in these conditions and a common molecular mechanism of the identified missense changes (gain of function), these entities represent a phenotypic continuum and have been curated under the encompassing term of “KCNH1-associated disorders” (PMIDs: 26264464, 27282200, 25420144, 25915598, 33811134, 33594261, 33494179, 26818738, 32956079). \n\nEvidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and functional studies on the missense variants. Notably, experimental data using patient cells and knock-in animal models with disease causing variants are lacking for *KCNH1*.\n\nThere are roughly 30 affected individuals with *KCNH1* variants reported in the literature to date (PMIDs: 33594261, 33494179, 33811134). Nearly all of the cases had de novo missense variants; however, there are at least 2 reports of inheritance of this disorder from mothers who showed low level somatic mosaicism for the *KCNH1* variant (PMID: 25420144). Two independent studies assessed a handful of *KCNH1* missense variants seen in affected individuals by in vitro patch-clamp studies and were shown to cause gain of function effects (PMIDs: 25420144, 25915598). The postulated disease mechanism for KCNH1 missense variants is through gain of function, though in a single case, an inherited nonsense variant (exon 8 of 11) was reported in an individual with seizures and in other asymptomatic family members suggesting non-penetrance (PMID: 33494179). This case was not scored.\n\nFor experimental evidence and animal models for *KCNH1*, there are only loss of function-based mouse and Zebrafish models reported (PMIDs: 22927438, 22927438). Since this is not consistent with the postulated molecular mechanism of the missense *KCNH1* variants seen in the affected individuals, these studies were not scored.\n\n*KCNH1* is definitively associated with KCNH1-associated disorders. This classification has been approved by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel on April 5, 2022 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/aec98279-6bd5-433a-81c0-abe96d657dbf","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9b090a30-6065-4337-b930-d40585b142cd","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":[{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"},{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},{"id":"cg:newEvidence"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9b090a30-6065-4337-b930-d40585b142cd_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2022-04-05T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9b090a30-6065-4337-b930-d40585b142cd_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2022-06-30T19:13:51.008Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9b090a30-6065-4337-b930-d40585b142cd_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9b090a30-6065-4337-b930-d40585b142cd_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a0bbf286-4878-4c30-b215-c2f9bd0a1848","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Downgraded to 0 points because (1) this is a morpholino model system and (2) the mechanism observed in zebrafish (LoF) does not match what is observed in affected humans (GoF).","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cf2dd7cd-0b81-48e4-83ea-e34309925c20","type":"Finding","dc:description":"In teleost fish, the KCNH1 gene is duplicated creating kcnh1a and kcnh1b. kcnh1a and kcnh1b have distinct expression patterns in adult zebrafish but share expression in brain and testis.
