Holocarboxylase synthetase covalently links biotin to the five biotin-dependent carboxylases i.e. propionyl-CoA carboxylase, 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase, pyruvate carboxylase, and the mitochondrial and cytosolic acetyl-CoA carboxylases. Holocarboxylase synthetase deficiency therefore results in deficiency activity of these carboxylases, also known as Multiple Carboxylase deficiency (MCD). \nPatients with holocarboxylase synthetase deficiency usually present in the neonatal period or early infancy with tachypnea, skin rash, feeding problems, hypotonia, seizures, developmental delay, alopecia, and coma. Laboratory findings include metabolic acidosis, lactic acidosis, ketosis, hyperammonemia, and elevated 3-hydroxyisovalerate, 3-methylcrotonylglycine, methylcitrate, 3-hydroxypropionate on urine organic acids analysis. In most patients, the clinical and biochemical findings improve upon treatment with oral biotin, but some patients are only partially biotin-responsive.\nDeficiency of biotinidase, the enzyme that recycles biotin, also leads to MCD although the onset is usually later.\nBiallelic variants in HLCS were first reported in individuals with holocarboxylase synthetase deficiency in 1994 (Suzuki et al, PMID 7842009). Since then, over 50 variants have been associated with the condition (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar). The mechanism of disease is loss of function. \nEvidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level and experimental data. Ten unique variants (missense, nonsense, frameshift, intronic) from ten probands from seven publications were curated (Aoki et al, 1995, PMID  8541348; Dupuis et al, 1996, PMID 8817339; Sakamoto et al, 1998, PMID 9870216; Sakamoto et al, 2000; PMID 10653324; Morrone et al, 2002, PMID: 12124727; Bailey et al, 2008, PMID 18429047; Van Hove et al, 2008, PMID 18974016). Further evidence is available in the literature but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached.\nThe gene-disease relationship is also supported by the biochemical function of holocarboxylase synthetase in biotinylation of carboxylases, resulting in multiple carboxylase deficiency, which is consistent with the clinical and biochemical findings in these patients, including a specific pattern of abnormalities noted on analysis urine organic acids (León-Del-Rio et al, 1995, PMID 7753853; León-Del-Rio et al, 2017, PMID 28564555), as well as functional studies in fibroblasts from patients showing deficiency of carboxylase activity due to low biotin incorporation, and low affinity of HCS for biotin (Van Hove et al, 2008, PMID 18974016), and results of studies on purified HCS protein with various missense changes identified in patients, that correlate with clinical response to biotin (Dupuis et al, 1999, PMID 10068510). In summary, HLCS is definitively associated with holocarboxylase synthetase deficiency. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/542bf17b-95de-45aa-b4b4-7b4433436aeb","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ad306285-9588-48e3-a6fa-183db3f01fe9","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ad306285-9588-48e3-a6fa-183db3f01fe9_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10011","date":"2021-02-26T17:11:31.548Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ad306285-9588-48e3-a6fa-183db3f01fe9_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10011","date":"2021-02-26T17:11:53.853Z","role":"Publisher"},{"agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10084","role":"SecondaryContributor"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ad306285-9588-48e3-a6fa-183db3f01fe9_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a927bd28-c018-4cac-9e4e-a1cd2388d77f_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"This patient, with holocarboxylase synthetase (HCS) deficiency, is homozygous for a missense variant in HLCS, p.Leu384Pro (denoted as p.Leu237Pro in the publication due to use of a different transcript).

Human cells have five biotin-dependent carboxylases: propionyl-CoA carboxylase (PCC), pyruvate carboxylase (PC), methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase (MCC), and two forms of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC-1 and ACC-2). These enzymes participate in key reactions in gluconeogenesis, fatty acid synthesis, and amino acid catabolism. HCS attaches biotin to biotin-dependent carboxylases in a two-step, ATP-dependent reaction. In the first step, HCS transforms biotin into its active form, biotinyl-AMP. In the second step, biotinyl-AMP is used by HCS to transfer biotin to a specific lysine residue within the motif Met-Lys-Met.\nFurther evidence indicates that HCS also acts as a nuclear transcriptional coregulator of gene expression.\nThe function of HCS is consistent with the phenotype of individuals with deficiency of HCS activity. Of note, low activity of the biotin-dependent carboxylases is observed in individuals with this disorder, as well as metabolic abnormalities related to the low activity of those carboxylases.

In this study, BirA104 cells were infected with bacteriophage expressing a human lymphocyte cDNA library and plated on LB without biotin. Colonies able to grow without biotin were selected.
