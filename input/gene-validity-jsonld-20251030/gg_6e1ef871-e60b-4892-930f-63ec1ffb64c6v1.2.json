The most common phenotypes of DLG-related ID are intellectual disability and epilepsy. Less common features include abnormal movements, non-specific dysmorphic features, skeletal abnormalities, and various abnormal MRI findings (PMID:33597769). Given the neurodevelopmental phenotypes in addition to intellectual disability, variants in DLG have been curated for the disease entity complex neurodevelopmental disorder. Eight variants (6 loss-of-function and 2 missense) that have been reported in 8 probands (PMID: 29460436, PMID: 29460436) are reported in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is thought to be haploinsufficiency.\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between DLG4 and autosomal dominant complex neurodevelopmental disorder. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time.
