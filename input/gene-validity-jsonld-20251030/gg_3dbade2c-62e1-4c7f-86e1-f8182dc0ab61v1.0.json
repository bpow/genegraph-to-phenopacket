CDC42, a master regulator of actin cytoskeleton and major node in intracellular signaling, is associated with a heterogeneous set of developmental and multi-system phenotypes, demonstrating the critical requirement of proper CDC42 function in a large array of developmental processes. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Patients have a broad spectrum of anomalies; core clinical features include defective growth, intellectual disability, facial dysmorphism, hearing/vision problems, cardiac malformations, immune, hematologic, and lymphatic abnormalities, and brain malformations. Nine unique missense variants have been reported in this gene in at least 9 probands in 2 publications (PMIDs: 26386261 and 29394990). Segregation was observed in one family (Family 30153 in PMID: 29394990), all others were de novo occurrences. This gene-disease relationship is supported by its interaction with WAS (PMID: 8643625) and multiple model systems with partial recapitulation of human disease (PMIDs: 29394990, 16510873, 20139097, 22387309). In summary CDC42 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant macrothrombocytopenia-lymphedema-developmental delay-facial dysmorphism-camptodactyly syndrome.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3dbade2c-62e1-4c7f-86e1-f8182dc0ab61","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/95177a3a-0dca-4945-8a44-f63697739cef","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/95177a3a-0dca-4945-8a44-f63697739cef_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2021-10-27T16:26:23.932Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/95177a3a-0dca-4945-8a44-f63697739cef_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2021-10-27T16:26:34.072Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/95177a3a-0dca-4945-8a44-f63697739cef_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/654c8641-3191-426a-946d-68f6daccfe65","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":" ","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/654c8641-3191-426a-946d-68f6daccfe65_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"Tyr23Cys on pGEX was overexpressed in E. coli and purified protein was analyzed for GTPase activity, GDP/GTP exchange, and binding to effectors.
