Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) occurs due to abnormal lymphocyte function, specifically T-cells and B-cells, thus resulting in increased susceptibility to infection. Omenn syndrome is a related disorder in which individuals typically have inflammation of the skin and viscera along with SCID-like lymphocyte abnormalities. A single homozygous hypomorphic missense variant, p.G52D, has been reported in 4 unrelated families of South Asian descent with a shared ancestral haplotype, suggesting it is likely a founder variant (PMID: 38787962). Two of the families were clinically described in previous publications (PMID: 15964782, 27577878).  NUDCD3-related SCID and Omenn syndrome are characterized by erythroderma, alopecia, viral and bacterial infections, increased eosinophils, hyperIgE, hepatomegaly, abnormal leukocyte and lymphocyte counts, reduced or absent B cells, and T-cell abnormalities. There is inter- and intra-familial phenotypic variability. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss of function; however, more research is needed to establish the disease mechanism. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence, including in vitro functional assays, expression studies, and animal models (PMIDs: 38787962). NUDCD3 was shown to disrupt V(D)J recombination leading to abnormal T and B cell development in both in vitro and in vivo studies. Additionally, it was shown that NUDCD3 plays a key role in the redistribution of RAG1 from nucleoli, which is known to be necessary for RAG recombinase function. \n\nIn summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. The experimental evidence was determined to be robust even with only a single variant being reporting in multiple consanguineous families from the same ethnic background; it has not been reported to occur in another population, and has not been replicated overtime. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the ClinGen SCID-CID GCEP on 04/17/2025 as per SOP v11. \n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8e5e1c78-323f-4175-b3b8-55ccf2f4df6e","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/48e17d44-6696-47ce-88fc-8e4bca6c420a","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/48e17d44-6696-47ce-88fc-8e4bca6c420a_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10081","date":"2025-10-01T13:41:51.545Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/48e17d44-6696-47ce-88fc-8e4bca6c420a_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10081","date":"2025-10-01T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"There was robust experimental data to support the association of NUDCD3 with SCID/Omenn syndrome, however, there has only been a single, likely founder, variant reported in individuals and it has not been replicated over time.
