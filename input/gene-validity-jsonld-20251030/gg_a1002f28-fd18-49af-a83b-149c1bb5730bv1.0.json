This association was made using case-level and experimental data. Familial hypercholesterolemia 4 is characterized by severe hypercholesterolemia and large tendon xanthomas. Increased plasma LDL levels occur as a result of defect in interaction with ***LDLR*** (PMID: 25399932). The *LDLRAP1* gene encodes a cytosolic protein which contains a phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain, that is essential for interaction with the cytoplasmic tail of *LDLR*. More than 20 variants, mostly frameshift and nosense, have been reported in humans. *LDLRAP1* has been associated with familial hypercholesterolemia 4 as early as 2001 (Garcia et al, 2001; PMID: 11326085).\n\nSummary of Case Level Data (12 points): The association is seen in at least 8 probands in 2 publications (PMID: 12464675, 11326085). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in additional family members (PMID: 11326085). More case-level evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts) has been reached.\n\nThe mechanism for disease is biallelic loss of function. \n\nSummary of Experimental Data (6 points): The LDLRAP1 protein has a role in the internalization of LDLR for plasma LDL clearance (PMID: 12451172). It physically interacts with *LDLR* and has a function in cholesterol metabolism similar to *LDLR* and *APOB*, mutations in which also cause familial hypercholesterolemia (PMID: 12221107, 16179341). Mouse models with *LDLRAP1* alterations recapitulate the human hypercholesterolemia phenotype (PMID: 12746448). Rescue of *LDLR* uptake and degradation by wild-type protein expression in patient cells has been demonstrated (PMID: 12464675). \n\nIn summary, the *LDLRAP1*-Familial hypercholesterolemia 4 gene-disease relationship is definitive. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a1002f28-fd18-49af-a83b-149c1bb5730b","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7ade5ed9-10e4-44f4-b02e-cc17ba68f1ab","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10004","role":"SecondaryContributor"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7ade5ed9-10e4-44f4-b02e-cc17ba68f1ab_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10026","date":"2022-11-21T15:42:27.121Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7ade5ed9-10e4-44f4-b02e-cc17ba68f1ab_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10026","date":"2022-09-22T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7ade5ed9-10e4-44f4-b02e-cc17ba68f1ab_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7ade5ed9-10e4-44f4-b02e-cc17ba68f1ab_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2503b026-d5d1-4039-9dc1-a32d694c8feb","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Increased score is awarded fro recapitulation of human phenotype and additional evidence.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b445605c-3d57-425d-ae18-dddca66775b0","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Plasma cholesterol levels of Ldlrap-/- mice (KO) were mildly elevated in chow-fed diet (83 mg/dl) compared to WT (68 mg/dl) and Ldlr-/-(196 mg/dl); however, on diet supplemented with 0.2% cholesterol, levels were similar in KO and Ldlr-/- mice. On diet with 1.2% cholesterol, dramatic elevations were observed: KO: 1270 mg/dl and Ldlr-/-: 1442 mg/dl. Liver cholesterol and triglyceride were unchanged. On the cholesterol-enriched diets, most of the cholesterol was in the LDL fraction in KO and in Ldlr–/– mice. On enriched diets, mean LDL-C level was 4.7-fold (0.2%) and 11-fold (1.2%) higher in the KO mice than in littermate controls and 7.3-fold (0.2%) and 42-fold (1.2%) higher than the KO mice on a chow diet. The half-time for clearance of LDL was over twice as long in the KO mice as in wild-type animals.\n\nAdditional evidence from PMID: 17200716 shows that the clearance of circulating VLDL remnants is largely preserved in mice lacking Ldlrap1. As a result, Ldlrap1-/- mice have near normal plasma levels of cholesterol on chow diets and are also significantly protected from the hypercholesterolemic effects of a sucrose-rich diet. The authors suggest that the requirements for hepatic LDLR function are ligand specific and that the preservation of VLDL remnant clearance attenuates the phenotype of LDLRAP1-associated hypercholesterolemia and likely contributes to greater responsiveness to statins in patients compared to those with FH.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12746448","rdfs:label":"Jones_Mouse","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":3},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a385b387-0451-4b04-9871-d258b7d8da83","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/981133ec-3d7f-44a3-8b90-9d49a987f7a8","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Mutant cell did not show uptake or degradation of LDL; however, infected cells were able to degrade LDL.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12464675","rdfs:label":"Eden_Rescue Patient cells","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:PhenotypeRescue"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellRescueCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7ade5ed9-10e4-44f4-b02e-cc17ba68f1ab_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e1cd4dd8-1284-4cee-b07c-647808352898","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/51de041b-34cb-4e93-81dc-2d0847a6959c","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"LDLRAP1 associates with the endocytic machinery.
