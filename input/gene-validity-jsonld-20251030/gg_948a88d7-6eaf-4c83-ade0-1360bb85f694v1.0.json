Duriez et al. report a proband with classic PCD symptoms including chronic respiratory infections with bronchiectasis, chronic sinusitis, serous otitis, and laterality defects (situs ambiguous with the heart and the liver located centrally). Ciliary beat from respiratory epithelial cells was normal, but ciliary ultrastructure was abnormal in 66% of respiratory cilia, with shortened or absent outer dynein arms. The proband is a compound heterozygote for a rare nonsense variant c.1277T>A (p.Leu426*) and a common variant in intron 6 present in almost 2% control alleles (c.271-27C>T). Of note, the variants were detected by gene-targeted methods and no other regions of the genome were investigated (PMID: 17360648).\nThe normal NME8 gene product consists of 2 isoforms, a full-length isoform (TXNDC3fl) and a second isoform carrying a 117bp in-frame deletion in exon 7 (TXNDC3d7). Duriez et al. showed that individuals heterozygous for the c.271-27C>T variant exhibit lower levels of the truncated TXNDC3d7 isoform in relation to the full-length TXNDC3fl isoform, compared to controls. Functional studies in HeLa cells also showed that the c.271-27C>T variant is associated with lower levels of the truncated TXNDC3d7 isoform and suggest that the variant is responsible for this alternative splicing event (PMID: 17360648).\nNME9, the closest paralog, also produces a full-length isoform and a truncated isoform missing exon 5, and it has been demonstrated that the truncated isoform binds to microtubules with higher affinity. Exon 5 of NME9 has high residue similarity to exon 7 of NME8. The authors therefore investigated the binding affinity to microtubules for the two NME8 isoforms and also found that the truncated TXNDC3d7 isoform binds to microtubules with higher affinity (PMID: 17360648).\nThis gene-disease association is also supported by experimental evidence that human tissues exhibiting the highest levels of NME8 expression include tissue types relevant to disease and known to have motile cilia, including the lung and testis (PMID: 23715323). In 2 organism models, however, NME8 expression was specific to sperm only (mice and sea urchin) (PMID: 12909633, 8970153). The sea urchin ortholog IC1 is one of the 3 intermediate chains of the sperm axoneme, the core units of sperm outer dynein arms (PMID: 8970153).\nIn summary, there is evidence to suggest that lower levels of the truncated TXNDC3d7 isoform can be associated with PCD. However, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Motile Ciliopathy GCEP on June 8, 2023 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/948a88d7-6eaf-4c83-ade0-1360bb85f694","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/57ca8383-55b6-4edd-9be2-67b1c5142ed1","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/57ca8383-55b6-4edd-9be2-67b1c5142ed1_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10102","date":"2023-06-30T20:40:53.103Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/57ca8383-55b6-4edd-9be2-67b1c5142ed1_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10102","date":"2023-06-08T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/57ca8383-55b6-4edd-9be2-67b1c5142ed1_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/57ca8383-55b6-4edd-9be2-67b1c5142ed1_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/62cde550-f440-4fbf-baa3-ec1905c05f44","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Inconclusive","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a5f74aad-0d75-45e2-a16a-45af49dc956f","type":"Finding","dc:description":"TXNDC6 is the closest paralog and exon 5 matches exon 7 of TXNDC3 (71% residue conservation).
