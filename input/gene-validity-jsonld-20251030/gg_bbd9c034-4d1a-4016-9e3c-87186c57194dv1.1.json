Genetic variants in THBD, which encodes thrombomodulin, have been reported to cause aHUS (PMID: 19625716) however, analysis of large aHUS cohorts (PMIDs: 23307876, 37369098, 37567446) and enrichment analysis (PMIDs: 29500241, 30377230) have failed to reproduce these findings. Therefore, none of the genetic variants in THBD identified in patients with aHUS were included in this curation for scoring. Furthermore, the experimental evidence available (PMID: 19625716) has been excluded in light of the evidence disputing this gene-disease relationship. In summary, the evidence supporting the relationship between THBD and autosomal dominant aHUS has been disputed and no valid evidence remains to support the claim.  More evidence is needed to either support or entirely refute the role\nTHBD plays in this disease. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Complement-Mediated Kidney Diseases GCEP on the meeting date May 15, 2024 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bbd9c034-4d1a-4016-9e3c-87186c57194d","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/867df2fb-b300-4f48-8be0-e600bee48bdd","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"NoKnownDiseaseRelationship","changes":[{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},{"id":"cg:classificationChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/867df2fb-b300-4f48-8be0-e600bee48bdd_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10069","date":"2025-05-12T15:14:36.801Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/867df2fb-b300-4f48-8be0-e600bee48bdd_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10069","date":"2024-06-28T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"Genetic variants in THBD, which encodes thrombomodulin, have been reported to cause aHUS (PMID: 19625716) however, analysis of large aHUS cohorts (PMIDs: 23307876, 37369098, 37567446) and enrichment analysis (PMIDs: 29500241, 30377230) have failed to reproduce these findings.","curationReasons":["ErrorClarification"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/867df2fb-b300-4f48-8be0-e600bee48bdd_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/867df2fb-b300-4f48-8be0-e600bee48bdd_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0}],"evidenceStrength":"Disputed","sequence":10321,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria10","strengthScore":0,"subject":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/_R2csQ9FYxs","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0016244","gene":"hgnc:11784","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"1.1","websiteLegacyID":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/assertion_867df2fb-b300-4f48-8be0-e600bee48bdd-","@context":{"@vocab":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"},"curationReasons":{"@type":"@vocab","@container":"@set"},"GCISnapshot":{"@type":"@id"},"dc:isVersionOf":{"@type":"@id"},"websiteLegacyID":{"@type":"@id"}}}
