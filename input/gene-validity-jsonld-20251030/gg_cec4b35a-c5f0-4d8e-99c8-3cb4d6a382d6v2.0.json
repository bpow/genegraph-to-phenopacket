This remained the sole *SRPX2* gene-disease relationship report until 2017 (PMID:28440294). Overall, three missense variants have been reported in humans to date (with one additional variant reported through a mouse model (PMID:24179158)). However, these variants do not have supportive functional evidence. *SRPX2* is not constrained for missense variants and at least one of the variants is present at a high frequency in the general population. While initial evidence (such as segregation and initial experiments) seemed to support pathogenicity in respect to epilepsy, subsequent evidence including mean allele frequency in gnomAD, a high dN/dS ratio, variable clinical presentations and the detection of another putative cause in one of the families (GRIN2A) (PMID:23933820) brings this gene disease relationship into question. Without significant supportive genetic evidence, a correlation to epilepsy and/or neurodevelopmental disorders is not supported. \n\nThis gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the ClinGen Epilepsy GCEP on July 8, 2018. It was reevaluated in October 2023. As a result of this reevaluation, the classification was changed from disputed to refuted due to lack of any additional supportive evidence. This updated classification was approved by the ClinGen Epilepsy GCEP on October 17th, 2023.\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cec4b35a-c5f0-4d8e-99c8-3cb4d6a382d6","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e9555886-a248-4bd4-b3dc-50ff503d6e7a","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"NoKnownDiseaseRelationship","changes":[{"id":"cg:sopChange"},{"id":"cg:classificationChange"},{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"},{"id":"cg:newEvidence"},{"id":"cg:summaryChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e9555886-a248-4bd4-b3dc-50ff503d6e7a_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10005","date":"2023-10-17T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e9555886-a248-4bd4-b3dc-50ff503d6e7a_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10005","date":"2024-08-12T18:28:05.617Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"Limited genetic evidence and an alternative explanation for 1 of the 2 reported families.
