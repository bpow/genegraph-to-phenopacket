Summary of case level and experimental data: 1.5 points. Only 3 cases of HCM have been reported: 2 of the cases were in patients with nemaline myopathy and the third case was in a patient with congenital myopathy with cores. Therefore, there is no genetic evidence fo HCM alone. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes  expression data showing altered gene expression in patients, and functional assays showing variants in ACTA1 result in decreased binding affinity for α-actinin compared to wild type. No convincing evidence for a causal role for ACTA1 in autosomal dominant hypertrophic cardiomyopathy has been reported. Although this gene-disease association is supported by the aforementioned expression studies and functional assays, no reports\nhave directly implicated the gene in humans.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/63cf89c4-9fcd-4e49-957c-608da6b51323","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f2459efe-385d-4056-b7e3-3a4a0c0d5edd","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"NoKnownDiseaseRelationship","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f2459efe-385d-4056-b7e3-3a4a0c0d5edd_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10008","date":"2020-05-01T12:44:47.908Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f2459efe-385d-4056-b7e3-3a4a0c0d5edd_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10008","date":"2020-09-16T19:23:27.477Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f2459efe-385d-4056-b7e3-3a4a0c0d5edd_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f2459efe-385d-4056-b7e3-3a4a0c0d5edd_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a7371d20-530b-4bff-bf8a-965464a02c35","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/06948705-9aae-4c28-a50f-c2de17ad69c3","type":"Finding","dc:description":"K336E mutant showed decreased binding affinity for α-actinin compared to wild type.
