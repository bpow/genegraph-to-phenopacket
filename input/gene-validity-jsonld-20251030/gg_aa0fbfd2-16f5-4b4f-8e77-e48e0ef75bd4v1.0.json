This is the only patient reported to date; two variants (one hypomorphic missense variant and one null nonsense variant) were reported in this proband (PMID: 35947077). Experimentally, this gene-disease relationship is supported by its expression pattern and biochemical function. During embryogenesis, the transcription factor Pax5 is expressed, together with the related Pax2 protein, in the isthmic organizer at the midbrain–hindbrain boundary, from which the cerebellum, and within the hematopoietic system, Pax5 is exclusively expressed in the B lymphoid lineage (PMID: 17600970). At the molecular level, Pax5 performs a dual role in B lymphopoiesis by acting as a transcriptional repressor to suppress B lineage–inappropriate genes and as an activator to induce gene expression required for B cell development and function (PMID: 17658281). In patient cells the residual mature B cells of the patient were impaired in their function due to the observed PI3K signaling defect (PMID: 35947077). Furthermore, in mouse models both Pax5R31Q/E242* and Pax5R31Q/− mutant mice, with patient derived mutations, revealed an early B cell developmental block and impaired immune responses as the cause of hypogammaglobulinemia (PMID: 35947077) and Pax5R31Q/− mutant mice exhibited aberrant social and stereotypical behavior and cognitive deficits. In summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged.\n\nOf note, *PAX5* has also been identified as a candidate ASD risk gene with de novo heterozygous loss of function variants in 8PAX58 identified in large cohorts of individuals with ASD (Gofin et al., 2022; Iossifov et al., 2012; O’Roak et al., 2014; Stessman et al., 2017). This curation only considered *PAX5* variation related to a monogenic form of ASD accompanied by hypogammaglobulinemia. Another important function of Pax5, not considered in this curation, is to suppress B cell tumorigenesis in mice (Cobaleda et al., 2007) and humans (Mullighan et al., 2007), where heterozygous *PAX5* mutations prominently contribute to the development of B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Gu et al., 2019).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/aa0fbfd2-16f5-4b4f-8e77-e48e0ef75bd4","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/111b7453-55ff-4638-9cb7-1936400ec2a4","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/111b7453-55ff-4638-9cb7-1936400ec2a4_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10080","date":"2023-02-28T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/111b7453-55ff-4638-9cb7-1936400ec2a4_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10080","date":"2023-06-12T20:14:31.245Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/111b7453-55ff-4638-9cb7-1936400ec2a4_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bfdaaa08-b0d7-4b7c-adc9-370ece436172_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/93bd4f06-a53b-49f9-ba85-e7911b7cb6bd","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The missense mutation R31Q is in the N-terminal part of the DNA-binding paired domain and was inherited from the mother.","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/93bd4f06-a53b-49f9-ba85-e7911b7cb6bd_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"The PAX5-R31Q protein was able to activate a PAX5-dependent luciferase reporter gene in transiently transfected HEK-293T cells, albeit less efficiently compared with the wild-type PAX5 protein.","functionalDataSupport":"Yes"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/93bd4f06-a53b-49f9-ba85-e7911b7cb6bd_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35947077","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/422463b1-4e96-4ce8-bbd3-5aba732498a7","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_016734.3(PAX5):c.92G>A (p.Arg31Gln)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA373488446"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2346740d-4b29-4a51-9145-88f0dd38b5df","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The nonsense variant occurs in exon 6 of 10 and is predicted to result in NMD.

Similar to the patient, the frequency of B cells in the peripheral blood of Pax5R31Q/E242* and Pax5R31Q/− mice was strongly reduced compared with control, moreover, total B cell numbers were 3.5-fold reduced in the bone marrow. Pro-B cells were, however, 3-fold increased, while pre-B and immature B cells were 7- and 9-fold decreased in Pax5R31Q/E242* and Pax5R31Q/− mice compared.\n\nWhen immunized with the T cell–independent antigen Pl4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenylacetyl (NP)–conjugated Ficoll. NP-specific plasma cells were strongly reduced on day 7 after NP-Ficoll immunization in the spleen of Pax5R31Q/− mice compared with Pax5+/+ mice. Immunization with the T cell–dependent antigen NP-keyhole limpet hemocyanin (NP-KLH) in the adjuvant alum demonstrated that no germinal center (GC) B cells were generated in the spleen of Pax5R31Q/− mice on day 14 after immunization. These data demonstrated that the B cell immune responses to T cell–independent and T cell–dependent antigens were largely lost in the Pax5R31Q/− mouse model, consistent with the patient’s diagnosis of hypogammaglobulinemia.\n\nPax5R31Q/− mice demonstrated substantial motor performance deficits in the Rotarod assay compared with Pax5+/− and Pax5+/+ mice. In the ErasmusLadder test, both Pax5R31Q/− and Pax5+/− mice demonstrated impaired performance as illustrated by the prolonged time required to traverse the ErasmusLadder, the increased frequency of missteps, and the increased time performing short and long steps. Similar motor performance and motor learning deficits were observed in both the patient and the Pax5R31Q/− mouse model.\n\nThe three-chamber social interaction assay unveiled hypersociability as a prominent trait of the Pax5R31Q/− mouse, which may reflect the social disinhibition of the patient. Hyperactivity in the mice were also consistent with the restlessness that was reported for the patient. Pax5R31Q/− mice displayed impaired spatial learning in the Y-maze, which is consistent with the observed cognitive impairment of the patient. \n\nSimilar to patients, high-resolution MRI of the brains of Pax5R31Q/− and control Pax5+/+ mice revealed significant differences in the volume of the vermal lobules IV/V and VII. Within the midbrain of the patient, there was hypoplasia of several midbrain and subcortical structures, which was most notable in the SN pars compacta (SNc) and pars reticularis (SNr) as well as in the VTA, compared with age- and gender-matched controls. These three regions were also significantly reduced in the midbrain of Pax5R31Q/− mice compared with Pax5+/+ mice. Hence, the same neuroanatomic defects were observed in both the patient and corresponding mouse model. Furthermore, both the patient as well as the Pax5R31Q/− mouse showed structural cerebellar abnormalities, which are a common pathological finding in ASD.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35947077","rdfs:label":"Pax5R31Q/E242* and Pax5R31Q/− mouse models","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":4}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/111b7453-55ff-4638-9cb7-1936400ec2a4_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fbc1f614-ad74-4723-ba70-2c8c6c9dddd2","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Pax5 has recently been shown to fulfill an important function in mature B cells by promoting PI3K signaling by down-regulating the expression of the PTEN protein, a negative regulator of this pathway (Calderón et al., 2021).","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fadc99c0-e358-414a-94ed-4e6e7a620196","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Analysis of EBV-immortalized B cells of the patient and a control revealed that PTEN expression was upregulated, and AKT phosphorylation at Ser473 was strongly reduced in B cells of the patient compared with the control.
