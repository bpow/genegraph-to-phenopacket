It almost always presents in early childhood and is often bilateral. The retinoblastoma gene (RB1) was the first tumor suppressor gene identified based on location in the region of 13q14 germline deletion in some patients with retinoblastoma (PMID: 3480530). Oncogenic point mutations in RB1 were first reported by Yandell DW, et al., 1989 (PMID: 2594029). RB1 encodes a negative regulator of the cell cycle through its ability to bind the transcription factor E2F and repress transcription of genes required for S phase (PMID: 10647931). There is abundant evidence published associating the RB1 gene with retinoblastoma. Multiple case level studies (PMID: 2594029, 25928201) and a case control study (PMID: 28193182) have been performed with retinoblastoma patients that have variants in the RB1 gene. The variants include single amino acid changes, the whole gene deletion (about 3-5%) and nonsense or frameshift LOF variants. Many de novo variants were reported. A significant amount of case-level data is available, but the maximum points for genetic evidence has been reached (12 points). A zebrafish model of RB1 has been established to show development of retinoblastoma consistent with the disease phenotype. Tumor formation was observed when the IRBP-Cre:Rb1-/- mice were crossed with Tp53 mice to heterozygosity. In summary, RB1 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant retinoblastoma. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e667325a-f592-43cf-82d0-49df58769369","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f8c79621-7ace-4c0c-874e-a315a2e6c872","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f8c79621-7ace-4c0c-874e-a315a2e6c872_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10023","date":"2020-07-30T21:39:29.219Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f8c79621-7ace-4c0c-874e-a315a2e6c872_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10023","date":"2020-09-16T19:23:29.207Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f8c79621-7ace-4c0c-874e-a315a2e6c872_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f8c79621-7ace-4c0c-874e-a315a2e6c872_ad_dn_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/94ca8b10-3aa2-4516-8012-f4a6f545c5a7_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5ba1877d-b204-4733-a610-bebbf0a4f303","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2594029","rdfs:label":"RB-74","ageType":"AgeAtDiagnosis","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":4,"detectionMethod":"Primer
