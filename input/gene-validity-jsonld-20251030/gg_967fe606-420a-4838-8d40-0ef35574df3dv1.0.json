A second patient was reported in Lévy R, et al., 2021 (PMID: 34623332) and both patients were homozygous for splice variants with a proposed loss of function mechanism. Experimentally, this gene-disease relationship is supported by its expression pattern and biochemical function. c-Rel, the protein product of *REL*, is strongly expressed by control EBV-B cells and was detected in all leukocyte subsets from healthy donors, the highest levels being recorded for γδ T cells, naive CD19+ B cells, CD16+ monocytes, and CD141+ conventional DCs (PMID: 34623332). c-Rel is a transcription factor in the NF-κB family, critical for T and B cell function, it binds to the promoters of genes that encode cytokines important for immunity against infectious pathogens, including IL-2, IFN-γ, IL-12, IL-21, and IL-23 (PMID: 22207895) with significant functional alteration observed in patients (PMID: 34623332). Furthermore, Rel-deficient mice have impaired T and B cell proliferation, hypogammaglobulinemia, and impaired cytokine production (PMID: 7649478, 10221648). The patient’s combined immunodeficiency mirrors the defects in T cell activation, B cell proliferation, innate immunity and humoral immunity seen in c-Rel-deficient mice. In summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/967fe606-420a-4838-8d40-0ef35574df3d","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ed422cfb-0cf3-44ec-8f36-5faace1a577d","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ed422cfb-0cf3-44ec-8f36-5faace1a577d_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10081","date":"2023-03-16T14:44:05.023Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ed422cfb-0cf3-44ec-8f36-5faace1a577d_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10081","date":"2023-03-16T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ed422cfb-0cf3-44ec-8f36-5faace1a577d_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/10fffb35-410d-41de-9c36-c1572df780be_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e3ee9209-a9d6-48fb-9676-7e536fcaf98d","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Amplification of the patient’s REL cDNA using primers specific to sequences in exons 2 and 7 identified an alternatively spliced transcript with lower expression than that of wild-type REL from control cDNA.

Splenic B and T cells from mice of the three c-rel genotypes were stimulated with a number of agents and proliferation monitored by [3H]thymidine incorporation. In Rel-/- B cell cultures, stimulation with optimal concentrations of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), CD40 ligand, mitogenic antibodies specific for the IgM receptor or the novel B cell surface protein RP failed to induce proliferation. Whereas thymidine incorporation by Rel-/- B cells was 0.5% (anti-RP) to 2.5% (CD40 ligand) of normal levels, proliferation in the Rel +/- B cell cultures ranged between 14% (anti-RP)and 20% (anti-IgM) of the normal response. This indicates that Rel +/- B cells are partially defective for proliferation.\n\nThe T cell proliferative responses of Rel -/- and Rel +/- cells were also compromised. Whereas engagement of the CD3 chain of the T cell receptor complex normally induces proliferation, Rel -/- T cells failed to proliferate in response to anti-CD3 activation (3% of normal T cell [3H]thymidine incorporation after 72 hr), and this defect was not overcome by CD28 costimulation. Concanavalin A (Con A) also failed to promote normal proliferation of Rel-/- T cells (20% of a normal T cell response, at 72 hr). In contrast, proliferation in Rel-/- T cell cultures stimulated with PMA and ionomycin was ---70% of a normal response. These results indicate that although Rel is required for surface receptor-mediated B and T cell proliferation, in T cells, mitogenic signals that act in the cytoplasm can bypass the defect imposed by the loss of Rel.\n\nThe responsiveness of mature B cells to antigenic challenge was assessed by analyzing serum immunoglobulins in naive and immunized animals. Whereas the levels of IgM(3-fold), IgG2b(6-fold), and IgG3(4-fold)in Rel -/- mice were somewhat reduced compared with Rel +/- and wild-type littermates, IgG1 levels in Rel-/- animals were 100-fold less and IgG2a was undetectable. Rel +/- mice also appear to be partially defective for IgG 1 production because serum IgG1, but not other isotypes, was 10-fold lower than in normal littermates.\n\nIgG3, a prominent isotype produced during a normal response to the T cell independent antigen NP-LPS, was marginally reduced 7 days postimmunization in the Rel-/- mice compared with normal and Rel +/- littermates and continued to decrease over the subsequent 14 days of the immune response, and thus Rel appears to be important for T cell dependent humoral responses.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7649478","rdfs:label":"c-rel -/- mice","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":3},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ed422cfb-0cf3-44ec-8f36-5faace1a577d_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b744a722-ebd6-4b65-927e-0271a7fcd2bf","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e0bc0641-cca5-4fa1-bee7-3105bee13dbd","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Show that c-Rel was essential for the development and/or maintenance of NK cells, Temra CD8+ T cells, memory CD4+ T cells, including Th1 and Th1*, Tregs, and memory B cells. \n\nIn myeloid cells, c-Rel was required for the production of IL-12 and IL-23 and for antigen-specific T cell responses, at least through the regulation of CD86 expression and, therefore, APC function. \n\nThe IL-2 production defect also affects the patient’s T cell proliferation, accounting for the broader defect in cytokine production by memory CD4+ T cells ex vivo and the defective differentiation of naive CD4+ T cells into Th1 and Th17 cells in vitro. \n\nFinally, c-Rel deficiency affects the CD40-mediated induction of antiapoptotic MYC and BCL2L1 in naive B cells, compromising the survival of these cells and thereby affecting their proliferation and differentiation into Ab-secreting cells. \n","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34623332","rdfs:label":"c-Rel deficiency"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ed422cfb-0cf3-44ec-8f36-5faace1a577d_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6d6b96bd-2182-4a4e-857f-85a07ad4fd8c","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"c-Rel is required for a number of specialized functions in mature T and B cells. \n\nc-Rel plays a key role in the development of regulatory T cells and in mature T cells it has multiples roles in growth, proliferation, and survival.
