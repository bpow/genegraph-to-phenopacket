HADDS is a neurodevelopmental syndrome characterized by congenital hypotonia, delayed psychomotor development, intellectual disability with speech delay, variable dysmorphic facial features, and ataxia, often related to cerebellar hypoplasia. Less frequently, urogenital abnormalities, short stature, microcephaly, etc. may be observed. Ten variants (missense, nonsense, frameshift, canonical splice site) that have been reported in 10 probands in 5 publications (PMIDs: 28017370, 28017372, 28017373, 34050706, 35340043) are included in this curation. Inheritance of variants is primarily *de novo*. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be LOF, with some publications also indicating a dominant-negative mechanism (PMIDs: 28017370, 28017372, 28017373, 34050706). This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence. Variants tested demonstrated functional alterations leading to greatly reduced activity as demonstrated by a luciferase reporter assay. The respective protein variants were mislocalized to the cytoplasm as demonstrated by *in situ* subcellular fractionation (PMID: 28017373). \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between *EBF3* and autosomal dominant hypotonia, ataxia, and delayed development syndrome (HADDS). This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel on May 16, 2023 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d7ac429e-ba46-4805-a1d2-38d24f58f0c9","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c194cac3-00f5-44b5-9993-64cf7aca9cf4","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c194cac3-00f5-44b5-9993-64cf7aca9cf4_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2023-05-16T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c194cac3-00f5-44b5-9993-64cf7aca9cf4_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2023-06-28T17:03:13.957Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c194cac3-00f5-44b5-9993-64cf7aca9cf4_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c194cac3-00f5-44b5-9993-64cf7aca9cf4_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/613abced-c530-48b0-b927-477938057d80","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Multiple variants observed in patients displayed similar results.","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c0176039-5c8c-4dbc-b478-258a54790e6c","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Mislocalization in the cytoplasm was detected where WT was exclusively localized in the nucleus.
