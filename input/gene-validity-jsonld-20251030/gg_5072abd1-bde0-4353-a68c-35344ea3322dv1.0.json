ZNF341 deficiency is associated with high levels of IgE, eczema, atopic dermatitis, chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis, and recurrent pulmonary infections. ZNF341 is a transcription factor that regulates STAT3 expression; patients with ZNF341 deficiency showed decreased expression and STAT3 function in T lymphocytes. Decrease Th17 subsets characterize the immunologic phenotype of ZNF341 deficient patients. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental evidence. This curation included ten probands from 10 unrelated consanguineous families (PMID: 29907691, 29907690 & 37080116). All the alleles are loss of function with experimental data, except for the allele p.Ser64Ter. Experimentally, this gene-disease relationship is supported by its wide expression in immune cells such as B cells, T cells, monocytes, and basophils and its role in regulating STAT3 expression demonstrated by CHIP-Seq and RNAseq in patient´s cells and in vitro cell models. In summary, ZNF341 is definitively associated with Hyper IgE syndrome 3, autosomal recessive, with recurrent infections.
