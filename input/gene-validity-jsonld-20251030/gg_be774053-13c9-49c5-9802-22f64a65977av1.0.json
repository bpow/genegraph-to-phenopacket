{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/be774053-13c9-49c5-9802-22f64a65977av1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"The relationship between TPK1 and Leigh syndrome spectrum was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of August 10, 2020. The TPK1 gene encodes thiamine pyrophosphokinase 1, which catalyzes the conversion of thiamine to thiamine pyrophosphate (thiamine diphosphate or TDP). TDP is the metabolically active form of thiamine, which acts a cofactor of several thiamine-dependent enzymes in the cytosol, peroxisomes, and mitochondria. In the mitochondria, TDP acts as a cofactor of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. \n\nThe TPK1 gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Leigh syndrome spectrum in 2011 (PMID: 22152682). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included 10 variants identified in seven cases in six publications (PMIDs: 22152682, 25458521, 27896076, 30483896, 30789823, 31288420). No segregation data were available. Loss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease association is also supported by biochemical function, expression data, and model systems (PMIDs: 31095747, 18853439, 31127358). \n\nIn summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on August 10, 2020 (SOP Version 7).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/be774053-13c9-49c5-9802-22f64a65977a","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/74e89426-cb27-4474-b892-dc303a9de644","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/74e89426-cb27-4474-b892-dc303a9de644_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2021-01-14T21:28:00.773Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/74e89426-cb27-4474-b892-dc303a9de644_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2021-01-14T21:28:26.689Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/74e89426-cb27-4474-b892-dc303a9de644_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/74e89426-cb27-4474-b892-dc303a9de644_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/50b3d097-c345-4c55-b213-ff29d30b6de2","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"0.5 score fro embryonic lethality (according to Mito disease ClinGen scoring rubric)","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7978a152-14bc-4eba-9f4d-aeda8b553389","type":"Finding","dc:description":"KO mouse, homozygous embryonic lethal prior to organogenesis\nHeterozygous: abnormal neural closure at E9.5; Early adult:increased body fat, cateract, Late adult: impaired righting response, abnormal limb grasping, increased grip strength","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31127358","rdfs:label":"IMPC mouse KO model","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/74e89426-cb27-4474-b892-dc303a9de644_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6add4e23-4c35-4bc3-bd29-61501d26c400","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Two genes involved in thiamine metabolism are associated with Leigh syndrome spectrum; SLC19A3 (thiamine transporter-2) and SLC25A19 (import of TPP into the mitochondria).
