This association was made using case-level and experimental data. More than a 30 pathogenic variants in this gene are reported in humans, ranging from partial deletions and duplications, nonsense, frameshift, missense and splicing variants. Congenital fibrinogen deficiency is characterized by quantitative and qualitative defects in fibrinogen. It may manifest as afibrinogenemia, dysfibrinogenemia and hypodysfibrinogenemia. Clinical symptoms include a bleeding diathesis and/or a thrombotic phenotype. \n\nSummary of Case Level Data (12 points): The association is seen in at least 10 probands in 6 publications (PMID: 10880389, 19551918, 28992465, 11354637, 15284111, 23560673). More case-level evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts) has been reached.\n\nThe mechanism for disease have been reported to be heterozygous as well as biallelic loss of function (PMID: 23560673, 28992465). \n\nSummary of Experimental Data (6 points): FGG encodes the γ subunit of the coagulation factor, fibrinogen, which is a hexamer of three subunit chains (PMID: 22836683). It is synthesized in the liver and secreted into the plasma (PMID: 20921339). Two mouse models that recapitulate fibrinogen deficiency are reported (PMID: 10980108, 15304068). The γ-chain of fibrinogen is the site of interation with FXIII, which accelerates the formation of the fibrin clot (PMID: 25809477).  \n\nIn summary, the FGG-Congenital fibrinogen deficiency gene-disease relationship is definitive. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hemostasis/Thrombosis GCEP on January 22, 2020. (SOP Version 7)\n\nLumping & Splitting information: OMIM assertions - (1) Congenital Afibrinogenemia (MIM: 202400); (2) Congenital Dysfibrinogenemia (MIM: 616004); (3) Congenital Hypodysfibrinogenemia (MIM: 616004); (4) Congenital Hypofibrinogenemia (MIM: 202400). Orphanet assertions - (1)  Familial afibrinogenemia; (2)  Familial dysfibrinogenemia; (3) Familial hypodysfibrinogenemia; (4)  Familial hypofibrinogenemia. \nPer criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in molecular mechanism(s) underlying the disease entities: Congenital Afibrinogenemia, Congenital Dysfibrinogenemia, Congenital Hypodysfibrinogenemia and Congenital hypofibrinogenemia. These entities have been lumped together under Congenital Fibrinogen Deficiency.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/75b64176-5e05-4956-aead-4e6da2253cfe","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9ef37f0f-a5ae-402c-b319-7f7d731ecbb1","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9ef37f0f-a5ae-402c-b319-7f7d731ecbb1_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2020-01-23T17:33:01.596Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9ef37f0f-a5ae-402c-b319-7f7d731ecbb1_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9ef37f0f-a5ae-402c-b319-7f7d731ecbb1_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9ef37f0f-a5ae-402c-b319-7f7d731ecbb1_ad_null_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6f157691-7325-486b-8525-de2586a138b0_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The proband was heterozygous for the 2-bp deletion (NM_000509.4:c.1170_1171del) in the last exon that causes a frameshift and loss of the stop site and extension of the protein, Asp390GlufsTer59.
