This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hemostasis/Thrombosis GCEP on May 29, 2020 (SOP Version 7).\n\n\nDue to the overlapping phenotype of Chediak-Higashi Syndrome (CHS) with immunodeficiency and immune dysregulation, the PIRD GCEP has provided an addendum to this gene curation:\nA large proportion of CHS patients (~85-90%) develop hyperinflammatory (or immune dysregulation) manifestations categorized ashemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. There are a subset of patients who develop attenuated disease, which is regarded as atypical CHS. *LYST* is a 429 kDa protein with several distinct domains involved in several aspects of vesicle trafficking. Patients with CHS have giant lysosomes or lysosome-related organelles in many cell subsets. NK cells in CHS patients have aberrant morphology and function, including lytic granule polarization and size among other features that severely compromise NK cell cytotoxicity. However, cytokine secretion in NK cells does not appear to be affected. Therefore, *LYST* appears to be important for regulated exocytosis but not for constitutive exocytosis, which supports the development of IFN-gamma-driven hyperinflammatory syndromes in CHS patients, in response to a trigger or stimulus (e.g. viral infection). In mouse models, it has been shown that Lyst regulates TLR3 and TLR4-mediated proinflammatory responses with increased susceptibility to bacterial infections. In patients with hypomorphic *LYST* variants, the attenuated disease is associated with subclinical or no immunodeficiency but rather a progressive, neurodegenerative phenotype in early adulthood.
