Twelve variants (missense, nonsense, frameshift, splicing) that have been reported in 8 probands in 2 publications (PMIDs: 21310273, 23794683) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts) has been reached. Congenital myasthenic syndrome 12 is characterized by limb-girdle muscle weakness and tubular aggregates on muscle biopsies. The disease mechanism appears to be biallelic loss of function. Heterozygous carriers are reportedly unaffected. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by the biochemical function of GFPT1, which is involved in the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway that serves as a source of essential amino sugars for the synthesis of glycoproteins, glycolipids, and proteoglycans, animal models that recapitulate disease, and expression in skeletal muscle (PMIDs: 21310273, 29905857, 11679416). In summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between GFPT1 and to autosomal recessive congenital myasthenic syndrome 12.This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation GCEP on the meeting date July 3, 2024 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/58af8cbe-1819-4a68-ae30-8aeb6324bf68","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a8f8af21-a5dc-41aa-9bd3-b38c3a98d55c","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a8f8af21-a5dc-41aa-9bd3-b38c3a98d55c_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10135","date":"2024-07-03T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a8f8af21-a5dc-41aa-9bd3-b38c3a98d55c_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10135","date":"2024-07-23T19:35:05.543Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a8f8af21-a5dc-41aa-9bd3-b38c3a98d55c_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a8f8af21-a5dc-41aa-9bd3-b38c3a98d55c_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/872b170a-2fdb-4441-a979-1021fc33081b","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The phenotype of the knockout mouse significantly recapitulates human disease.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d9e5aa5a-ad20-483f-ba49-57823ed51e69","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Gfpt1-muscle knockout mice display poor motor performance, muscle fatigue, reduced contractile properties of diaphragm muscles, histological changes in skeletal muscle, presynaptic and postynaptic remodeling, which are all consitent with congenital myasthenic syndrome characterized by fatiguable muscle weakness.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29905857","rdfs:label":"Issop 2018 Mouse","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":3},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c68ba2ce-f2d2-40db-897e-c6c1837276a3","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2f307ff5-ad6e-4745-a004-9692f7e56a42","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Morpholino-mediated knockdown of gfpt1 in zebrafish embyros induced a neuromuscular phenotype, altered muscle histology, and delayed NMJ maturation.
