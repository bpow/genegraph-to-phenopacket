At least 4 unique variants (all missense) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 5 probands in 4 publications (PMIDs: 16267323, 21353613, 30440076, 33150193). This gene-disease association is supported by its biochemical function as glutamine synthetase (PMID: 5336023) and several conditional knockout mouse models with partial recapitulation of disease (PMIDs: 25870278, 20140959, 30053506). In summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship.\n\nThis gene-disease pair was previously evaluated by the Aminoacidopathy GCEP on 09/25/2020. It was reevaluated on 10/14/2022 with identification of one new proband (and affected sibling) in PMID: 33150193. It was reevaluated again on 12/9/2024 with no new evidence identified. As a result of this reevaluation, the classification remained Moderate.\n\nOf note, a novel disease entity was reported in relation to *GLUL* in 2024 (PMID: 38579670), glutamine synthetase stabilization disorder (GSSD) was reported due to monoallelic *de novo* dominant negative variants and will be considered seperately from this recessive loss of function

Thus, seizures and neurodegeneration are likely not directly caused by the Glul deficiency, but rather occur as a consequence of a pathological process involving reactive astrocytes and impaired neurovascular coupling. These slowly developing effects of Glul deficiency are different from the early onset epileptic encephalopathy observed in humans.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6acab20f-ab22-42af-8b87-c56ed0b0abe8","type":"Finding","dc:description":"The mice had alterations in locomotive activities (hypoactivity) and besides periodic running fits, facial automatisms with occasional falling and forelimb clonus were observed in the cKO mice older than 6 weeks, suggestive of seizures (confirmed by EEG).
