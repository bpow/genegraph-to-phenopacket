The TACO1 gene encodes the translational activator of cytochrome c oxidase I protein, which is required for translation of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I, a component of complex IV of the mitochondrial respiratory complex. The TACO1 gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Leigh syndrome spectrum in 2009 (PMID: 19503089). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Two loss of function variants in this gene have been reported in two consanguineous families in two publications (PMIDs: 19503089, 25044680). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in five additional family members, and segregation evidence was scored for one family (PMID: 19503089). Loss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by the biochemical function of the protein, functional alteration and rescue experiments in patient fibroblasts, and a homozygous knockout mouse model showed complex IV deficiency and a similar phenotype to human patients (PMIDs: 19503089, 27319982). In summary, there is moderate evidence to support the relationship between TACO1 and Leigh syndrome spectrum. This classification was approved by the NICHD U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on August 21, 2019.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/dd818324-6195-48a6-adad-644bb2995993","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ae2fd0e4-db4e-4e17-bfc8-c43719066f97","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ae2fd0e4-db4e-4e17-bfc8-c43719066f97_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ae2fd0e4-db4e-4e17-bfc8-c43719066f97_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2019-10-16T15:04:33.004Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ae2fd0e4-db4e-4e17-bfc8-c43719066f97_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ae2fd0e4-db4e-4e17-bfc8-c43719066f97_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ff392619-0588-46f0-8e98-ad7148ac6019","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Scored neuropathological evidence 0.5 points (Purkinje cell loss in cerebellum, atypical finding), mitochondrial dysfunction 1 point (demonstrated complex IV deficiency), and motor dysfunction 1 point (progressive motor decline and incoordination), per Mito GCEP review meeting","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/88606819-14ec-4619-9310-59446caa69cb","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Neuropathological evidence (Purkinje cell loss in cerebellum, atypical finding), mitochondrial dysfunction (demonstrated complex IV deficiency), motor dysfunction (progressive motor decline and incoordination)","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27319982","rdfs:label":"Knockout mouse model","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/39bbfee8-cc82-4248-8929-a7a0b6683fa9","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a50691cb-9500-4a0f-9078-7e586520eeae","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Expression of wild-type TACO1 in subject fibroblasts (homozygous for LOF variant) rescue the COX assembly defect (Fig. 4a), the COX I synthesis defect (Fig. 4b) and COX activity (104% of control).","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19503089","rdfs:label":"Weraarpachai rescue","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:PhenotypeRescue"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellRescueCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":3.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ae2fd0e4-db4e-4e17-bfc8-c43719066f97_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/01d55f8b-08c5-48fc-900b-039d868fae10","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c99b3c09-df83-4778-a9ff-ac49083584ba","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Isolated cytochrome c oxidase (COX) deficiency and a defect in the rate of synthesis of the COX I subunit","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19503089","rdfs:label":"Weraarpachai functional alteration"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ae2fd0e4-db4e-4e17-bfc8-c43719066f97_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3b2674ce-eb65-4668-b759-ef7091f3cca3","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"LeighMap paper 19 other translational proteins related to LS, increase points to maximum per Mito GCEP biocuration review meeting.","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1028797b-c9d4-4447-b95b-2e19eea2fd08","type":"Finding","dc:description":"TACO1 is an RNA-binding protein that specifically binds the cytochrome c oxidase (COX) subunit I (MT-CO1) mRNA and is required for COXI translation; MT-COI is a component of complex IV of the mitochondrial respiratory complex.
