Evidence of the association of this gene with DCM was re-evaluated using SOP v10 on 02/05/2025. As a result, the reclassification did not change. A summary of the information contributing to the classification of this gene at the time of re-evaluation is summarized herein.\n\nEYA4 was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant in 2000 (Schonberger et al, 2000, PMID: 10769282). Human genetic evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level and segregation data. Of note, EYA4-related DCM has been observed with accompanying sensorineural hearing loss. At least 1 unique variant has been reported in humans (Schonberger et al, 2000, PMID: 10769282). This variant segregated with disease in 9 additional family members. This gene-disease association is supported by expression studies and studies in a non-human model organism (Schonberger et al, 2005, PMID: 15735644). In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. More evidence is needed to support the relationship of EYA4 with autosomal dominant DCM. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Dilated Cardiomyopathy Working Group on 02/05/2025 (SOP Version 10).
