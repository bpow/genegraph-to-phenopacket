Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found differences in phenotypic variability. Therefore, the following diseases have been split into separate entities, aHUS (OMIM: 612925) and C3 glomerulopathy (C3G) (OMIM: 613779). The split curation for semidominant C3G will be conducted separately. Thirteen variants (missense) that have been reported in thirteen probands in three publications (PMIDs: 18796626, 25608561, 26826462) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is reported to be gain of function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by biochemical function in the complement mediated immune response, protein interaction with CFH and CFI, and a mouse model phenocopying disease in humans (PMIDs: 9291131, 21285368, 30714990). In summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between C3 and autosomal dominant aHUS. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Complement Mediated Kidney Diseases GCEP on the meeting date August 3, 2023 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/15def9c6-8b46-4187-a69e-9177aae90f72","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/78a4d83e-8fb0-4b47-9dfc-5dfe618e1aa3","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/78a4d83e-8fb0-4b47-9dfc-5dfe618e1aa3_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10069","date":"2023-09-29T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/78a4d83e-8fb0-4b47-9dfc-5dfe618e1aa3_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10069","date":"2023-09-29T15:31:15.335Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/78a4d83e-8fb0-4b47-9dfc-5dfe618e1aa3_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/78a4d83e-8fb0-4b47-9dfc-5dfe618e1aa3_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/67a8b9fa-d985-40b7-a104-ef514e02dce4","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"This model was upgraded due to phenotypic specificity caused by a variant observed in human patients.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/94ed06f8-6def-4750-82a5-77d0cef39d0d","type":"Finding","dc:description":"When transferred to mice, an aHUS-associated gain-of-function change (D1115N) to the complement-activation protein C3 results in aHUS.
