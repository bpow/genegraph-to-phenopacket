Three siblings with mild-moderate intellectual disability in a consanguineous family were reported with a homozygous nonsense *ZC3H14* variant (PMID: 21734151). An additional consanguineous family with 3 siblings with severe intellectual disability harbouring a homozygous intronic *ZC3H14* variant was also reported in 2011 (PMID: 21734151); however, this variant was found at a high frequency in gnomAD v2.1.1 (2.8% in the Ashkenazi Jewish population) and was not scored. Homozygous *ZC3H14* knock-out mouse and drosophila (null dNab2 ortholog) demonstrate impaired poly(A) tail length, expression of synaptic proteins, and impaired brain function and development (PMIDs: 21734151, 28666327). \nIn summary, there is limited evidence at this time to support the relationship between *ZC3H14* and autosomal recessive intellectual disability. Additional studies are required to verify this gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel on November 16, 2022 (SOP Version 9).\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b71ac739-ee66-4591-b183-9774c40f08b5","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9bd19228-7668-40f2-8fa3-8bdafe23f1d7","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9bd19228-7668-40f2-8fa3-8bdafe23f1d7_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2023-01-31T22:47:14.183Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9bd19228-7668-40f2-8fa3-8bdafe23f1d7_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2022-11-16T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9bd19228-7668-40f2-8fa3-8bdafe23f1d7_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/30833b8b-c14d-4fab-8314-7121552be737_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/caa226fd-72a7-4c4a-80ee-dd490c1c704f","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"2 points (total) were awarded based on the ID/autism expert group’s opinion that awarding 3 points (recommended based on SOP V9) for each case is too high and allows for too few (only 4) cases to reach a definitive classification for AR conditions.
