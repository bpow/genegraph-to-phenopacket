{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/20bb95cd-fb58-4904-93ea-b9555c35cb34v1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"*CC2D2A* (OMIM:612013) encodes for coiled-coil and C2 domain-containing protein 2A (CC2D2A), which localizes to the ciliary transition zone of the cilium (PMID:18950740). *CC2D2A* has been associated with the following autosomal-recessive disease entities: COACH syndrome 2 (OMIM:61911), Joubert syndrome 9 (OMIM:612285), Meckel syndrome 6 (OMIM:612284), and Retinitis pigmentosa 93 (OMIM:619845). Per the criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in molecular mechanism and inheritance pattern. While these disease entities represent a wide range of clinical severity, the molecular mechanism is loss of function, and all disease entities have autosomal-recessive inheritance. Therefore, the above disease entities have been lumped into one disease entity, ciliopathy (MONDO:0005308). \n\nPathogenic variants in *CC2D2A* were curated from nine affected probands with *CC2D2A*-ciliopathies from five different publications (PMID:18387594; PMID:18950740, PMID:18513680, PMID:19777577, PMID:19574260). Five of the curated probands were characterized by Joubert syndrome 9 (OMIM:612285) or COACH syndrome 2 (OMIM:61911); and four of the affected probands had Meckel syndrome 6 (OMIM:612284). Eight predicted protein-truncating variants and three missense variants were curated for a total of eleven unique variants. There are many more cases and variants described in detail in the literature (PMID:33486889), but the maximum of 12 points was reached. The mechanism of disease in all curated cases is homozygous or compound-heterozygous loss of function (PMID:18950740).  \n\nIn ciliopathy-causing genes, disruption to ciliary biogenesis is an established disease mechanism. CC2D2A localizes to the ciliary transition zone and plays a critical role in cilia formation, an established molecular function for known ciliopathy-causing gene products (PMID:24947469). CC2D2A physically interacts and co-localizes with CEP290, the protein product of a gene known to cause multiple hereditary ciliopathies with similar organ involvement and pleiotropy (OMIM:610142). In fibroblasts derived from a patient with Meckel syndrome (homozygous *CC2D2A* p.Gln588Ter), cilia were notably absent (PMID:18513680). The *Cc2d2a* knockout mouse model is embryonically lethal and demonstrates pleiotropic organogenesis defects that recapitulate the Meckel syndrome phenotype in humans (PMID:21725307; PMID:24947469). Cilia are absent from many tissues, including the embryonic node, perinatal kidney tubules, and the developing neural tube, where Shh signaling is consequently disrupted. (PMID:24947469). Primary cilium biogenesis defects observed in *Cc2d2a* loss-of-function mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) are consistent with the disease mechanism in humans, where loss and/or abnormal cilia morphology have been observed (PMID:24947469).  \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between *CC2D2A* and autosomal recessive ciliopathy-*CC2D2A*. The molecular mechanism is loss of function, leading to defects in ciliary formation and function. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time.  This classification was approved by the ClinGen Kidney Cystic and Ciliopathy Disorders GCEP on the meeting date 08/24/2022 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/20bb95cd-fb58-4904-93ea-b9555c35cb34","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0acbae16-a383-4345-978c-9d28dda80d02","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0acbae16-a383-4345-978c-9d28dda80d02_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10066","date":"2022-09-01T12:30:08.194Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0acbae16-a383-4345-978c-9d28dda80d02_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10066","date":"2022-08-24T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0acbae16-a383-4345-978c-9d28dda80d02_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0acbae16-a383-4345-978c-9d28dda80d02_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5edbe183-8efc-4eac-b69f-4b16126d97be","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Downgraded to 1 point due to limitations of phenotypic description","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e6a6d023-f4ff-47b5-8170-43442c707cc1","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Phenotypic features are consistent with a severe developmental ciliopathy presentation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21725307","rdfs:label":"Cc2d2a promotes ciliogenesis ","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/250a9986-4c8e-4468-a892-6ee4593624cf","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/dea3e5f1-935b-46c9-87bd-8f2882d7b2cb","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Cc2d2a-/- results in embryonic lethality and pleiotropic organogenesis defects comparable to MKS patients.
