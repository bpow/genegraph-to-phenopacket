Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we have split the autosomal recessive Fanconi anemia complementation group J into separate curation due to phenotypic variability and different inheritance patterns. We also curated separately the autosomal dominant hereditary breast cancer to refute the gene-disease relationship. Therefore, this curation solely focuses on autosomal dominant familial ovarian cancer. This gene-disease relationship has been studied in at least six case-control or cohort studies at the aggregate variant level (12 points). Five case-control studies suggested significant increased risk for ovarian cancer in monoallelic *BRIP1* variant carriers compared to controls (PMIDs: 26315354, 26720728, 29368626, 32359370, 35172496). Another case-control study (PMID: 31341520) showed conflicting results, in which the authors found a significant association of pathogenic variants in *BRIP1* and ovarian cancer by analyzing crude data; whereas age-adjusted data showed no ovarian cancer association, which may reflect that *BRIP1* variant carriers are more likely to be diagnosed with late-onset ovarian cancer than non-carriers. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence of protein interaction assay and cell culture models (1.5 Points; PMIDs: 11301010, 14576433, 16153896). Pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation assays revealed that the BRCT domain of BRCA1 protein directly interacts with phosphorylated BRIP1, which is further required for DNA damage-induced checkpoint control during the transition from G2 to M phase of the cell cycle. Cells deficient of *BRIP1* also failed to elicit homologous recombination after DNA double stranded breaks. In summary, *BRIP1* is definitively associated with autosomal dominant familial ovarian cancer. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.\n\nThis gene-disease pair was originally evaluated as definitive by the Breast/Ovarian Cancer GCEP on 10/12/2016. This re-curation was approved by the ClinGen Hereditary Diseases GCEP on 07/28/2023 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8e2919cd-1d7d-4384-887d-0be2c2cbe74d","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b1224a6d-5676-4109-b844-a577bd0bff62","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b1224a6d-5676-4109-b844-a577bd0bff62_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10023","date":"2023-12-21T01:14:48.217Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b1224a6d-5676-4109-b844-a577bd0bff62_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10023","date":"2023-12-20T18:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["RecurationNewEvidence","RecurationFrameworkChange"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b1224a6d-5676-4109-b844-a577bd0bff62_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b1224a6d-5676-4109-b844-a577bd0bff62_cc_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/57a02221-5084-405d-8840-7267a605459e","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"This paper takes a collective of information and provides a similar result to those identified in other papers in this curation.
