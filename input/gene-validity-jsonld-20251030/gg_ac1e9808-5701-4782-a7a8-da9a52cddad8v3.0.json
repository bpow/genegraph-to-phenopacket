Two different truncating variants have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in five probands in five publications [PMID: 25049278, 25564403, 27436851, 28267383, 33190022]. This gene-disease relationship is supported by its protein interactions with Thrombin, which regulates anticoagulant pathway [PMID: 8663147], biochemical function that THBD protein forms a 1:1 complex with the coagulation factor thrombin and alters thrombin's specificity toward several substrates, ultimately acting as an antithrombotic factor [PMID:22036808], Expression studies that Thrombomodulin is found in most human endothelium including that of arteries, veins, capillaries, and lymphatics. This localization well serves its function as a cofactor for protein C activation [PMID: 2991298],  Expression studies that high soluble THBD protein in plasma in the patients [PMID: 25564403], functional alteration in patient cells showing reduced tissue factor-induced thrombin generation and  significantly delayed plasma clots lysis, and Model Systems using cell culture that addition of soluble TM to control plasma caused dose-dependent reductions in ETP and peak thrombin, which were similar to the patients [PMID: 27436851]. In summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged. This classification was originally approved by the ClinGen Hemostasis Thrombosis Gene Curation Expert Panel on Dec 10, 2021. This gene-disease relationship was reevaluated on November 06, 2023. As a result of this reevaluation, the classification did not change.\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ac1e9808-5701-4782-a7a8-da9a52cddad8","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/358cb384-4303-425d-9b92-509c600c2d03","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","changes":{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/358cb384-4303-425d-9b92-509c600c2d03_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2023-11-06T18:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/358cb384-4303-425d-9b92-509c600c2d03_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2024-05-03T16:39:20.006Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["RecurationTiming"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/358cb384-4303-425d-9b92-509c600c2d03_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/358cb384-4303-425d-9b92-509c600c2d03_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1abff2fa-a49f-40a7-bf5f-bbe68ab08c5b","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/877b0783-095c-439b-a383-d54250a679d3","type":"Finding","dc:description":"There are 8 affected family members carrying the same c.1611C>A (p.Cys537Ter) truncating variant.

The novelty of filtered variants was elucidated by both the external and internal controls sequenced and analyzed. Copy number variants were detected using ExomeDepth. Variants were then called using a custom-made bioinformatics pipeline to determine candidate variants from the WES data as previously shown by the GAPP study. Comparison of both patients with a MAF ≤ 0.01 reduced to a total of 17 sequence variants. Candidate sequence variants were selected and reduced on the basis of a pathogenic prediction in at least three out of four of the prediction tools. This left candidate\nvariants in five genes: APC, PDE3A, ACE, OCLN, and THBD.Sanger sequencing was then performed on candidate variants to confirm the variants, thereby ruling out the possibility of false-positive results of WES. Sanger sequencing confirmed that the genetic variant in THBD (c.1611C>A) was present in both patients.","firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"a mother and son with a lifelong bleeding tendency and posttraumatic bleeding.

Simultaneously, the rate of fibrinolysis is delayed due to increased TAFI (thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor) activation by sTM.\n\nThe mechanism responsible for TM shedding is complex and is not completely understood. In another paper [PMID: 29145514], the authors proposed that higher sensitivity of the TM1-536 to the proteolysis by metalloproteases and a defect of synthesis due to the decreased size of the transmembrane domain might explain the high levels of soluble TM in plasma of the carriers.\n\nTherefore, the truncating variant is likely to escape the NMD effect and result in a truncating protein.
