While various names could be given to the constellation of features seen in those with *YME1L1*-related disorders, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *YME1L1* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework. \n\nEvidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included one homozygous missense variant in one proband (four affected children in this consanguineous family) in one publication (PMID: 27495975). Clinical features in affected individuals include developmental delay, optic atrophy, hearing impairment, ataxia, and intellectual disability. Brain imaging was consistent with a leukoencephalopathy and brain atrophy. Lactate was elevated in blood and cerebrospinal fluid. Muscle biopsy showed parking lot and paracrystalline inclusions. Mitochondrial respiratory chain enzyme activities were normal in skin fibroblasts.\n\nThe mechanism of disease is loss of function. This gene-disease association is also supported by the known biochemical function of YME1L1, functional alteration in patient and non-patient cells, and mouse and pig models (PMIDs: 27495975, 22262461, 26785494, 37123411). \n\nIn summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on July 15, 2024 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3cbd6ab3-0270-4c87-a802-353f0351739a","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b403159f-e5ae-446c-bb17-222dc8eebded","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b403159f-e5ae-446c-bb17-222dc8eebded_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2024-07-15T04:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b403159f-e5ae-446c-bb17-222dc8eebded_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2025-01-15T21:33:04.230Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"There is only one case report so this is classified as Limited.","curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b403159f-e5ae-446c-bb17-222dc8eebded_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/359e1a05-1def-403a-a3f9-50ab4a7b6730_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f7507ad9-363f-4c91-b747-5fc2a7fe5580","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"This variant occurs in within the N-terminal MTS and impairs maturation of the protein upon import to the mitochondria.
