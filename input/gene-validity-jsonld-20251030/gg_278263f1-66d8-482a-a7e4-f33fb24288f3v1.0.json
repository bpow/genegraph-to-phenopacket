At least 12 unique variants (nonsense, frameshift, and splicing) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 13 probands in 6 publications (22317976, 29230583, 31307516, 8894686, 25790162, 30390570). Variants in this gene segregated in 9 additional family members. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence and experimental evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of disease is haploinsufficiency. This gene-disease association is supported by animal models and expression studies. In summary, TCOF1 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant Treacher Collins syndrome.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/278263f1-66d8-482a-a7e4-f33fb24288f3","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3f91c5fe-8e58-4c98-9878-e428e2e41dd7","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3f91c5fe-8e58-4c98-9878-e428e2e41dd7_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2019-09-17T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3f91c5fe-8e58-4c98-9878-e428e2e41dd7_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3f91c5fe-8e58-4c98-9878-e428e2e41dd7_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3f91c5fe-8e58-4c98-9878-e428e2e41dd7_ad_dn_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d62a6490-4511-44dd-8945-dead279c4370_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Paternity/maternity confirmation is unknown","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/35e8b962-c3f4-4c75-be15-c827e5abdc23","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25790162","rdfs:label":"Patient 21","ageType":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/","ageUnit":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/","detectionMethod":"Patients with Treacher Collins Syndrome were screened successively for TCOF1, POLR1D, POLR1C, and EFTUD2 using Sanger, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification analysis, array-comparative genomic hybridization, and denaturing high-pressure liquid chromatography.","firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"Downward-slating palpebral fissures, malar hypoplasia, conductive deafness, mandibular hypoplasia, microtia","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0008551","obo:HP_0000405","obo:HP_0000494","obo:HP_0000347","obo:HP_0000272"],"previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d62a6490-4511-44dd-8945-dead279c4370_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25790162","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/78ec596c-f5fc-4e64-8815-30d745bb14b8","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001135243.1(TCOF1):c.1021_1022del (p.Ser341GlnfsTer7)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA913203544"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:DeNovoAlleleOrigin"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"No"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADDeNovoCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a534f92b-8fd8-4738-8980-62e290104c27_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Only the TCOF1 gene was analyzed for dosage and sequence (POLR1D & POLR1C not looked at).","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Inconclusive","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e81a03fe-c26f-4441-875b-1afc87d07034","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22317976","rdfs:label":"Patient 263","ageType":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/","ageUnit":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/","detectionMethod":"The 27 coding exons were amplified in 28 fragments and sequenced using BigDye 3.1 chemistry (Applied Biosystems).
