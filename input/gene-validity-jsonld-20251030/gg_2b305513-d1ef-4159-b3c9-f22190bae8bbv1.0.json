These probands were affected with congenital bilateral severe-to-profound sensorineural hearing loss and vestibular anomalies. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss-of-function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence (mouse model, expression-level evidence; PMIDs: 29107558, 19285943). A mouse model shows that homozygous mutants had fluid-filled cysts with no vestibular or cochlear outgrowth; abnormal cochlear structure; and delayed differentiation of hair cells in the cochlear duct. The mouse model was downgraded because hearing thresholds were not measured. There was also evidence of interaction between ESRP1 and other hearing-loss associated genes including POU4F3, FGFR2, EYA4, and COL11A2, but this was not scored due to lack of both specificity and strong evidence of causation (PMID: 29107558). In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hearing Loss GCEP on the meeting date 7/16/2025 (SOP Version 11).\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2b305513-d1ef-4159-b3c9-f22190bae8bb","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/59032887-828f-44ad-9cbd-192f1604a8f5","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/59032887-828f-44ad-9cbd-192f1604a8f5_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2025-07-22T20:58:36.261Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/59032887-828f-44ad-9cbd-192f1604a8f5_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2025-07-22T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/59032887-828f-44ad-9cbd-192f1604a8f5_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/59032887-828f-44ad-9cbd-192f1604a8f5_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9f359d80-d4ac-48a0-8aa7-a35ae6a7abf4","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The model was downgraded as the mice were not evaluated for hearing loss.
