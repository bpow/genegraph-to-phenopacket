ANKS6 is a critical component of the ciliary complex required for kidney and cardiovascular development and affected patients develop progressive kidney dysfunction that may or may not be accompanied by extrarenal manifestations, including hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, aortic stenosis, pulmonary stenosis, patent ductus arteriosus, situs inversus, and periportal liver fibrosis. At least 8 variants (3 frameshift, 3 splice, 2 missense) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 7 probands in 5 publications (PMIDs: 23793029; 31678577; 31635528, 24610927, 26489029). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is known to be biallelic loss of function. This gene-disease association is supported by animal models, expression studies, and protein interactions (PMIDs: 26039630, 25599650, 23793029). In summary, ANKS6 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive nephronophthisis (NPHP-ANKS6). This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Cystic and Ciliopathy Disorders GCEP on 08/25/21 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e38dd438-60c4-4d3b-ad5b-5c24b5d3e047","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/62df8a40-0b65-46a4-89c8-51f26424c523","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/62df8a40-0b65-46a4-89c8-51f26424c523_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10066","date":"2021-08-25T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/62df8a40-0b65-46a4-89c8-51f26424c523_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10066","date":"2021-11-12T13:38:51.564Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/62df8a40-0b65-46a4-89c8-51f26424c523_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/62df8a40-0b65-46a4-89c8-51f26424c523_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/dcf6825b-813b-491d-8cb6-dd73e3852c60","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1023c783-b527-4f9b-86c3-6ccf6c712573","type":"Finding","dc:description":"The phenotypic spectrum of left-right asymmetry randomization, CHD and cystic kidney malformations represents a characteristic syndrome of perturbed IC-mediated signaling, exemplified here by the Roc and Streaker mutant mice, and consistent with findings in the inv/inv mouse and the NPHP3 and Nek8 knockout mouse models5,6,7. It is phenotypically distinct from other ciliopathy syndromes, including the Joubert-syndrome related disorders, Meckel-Gruber syndrome or Bardet-Biedl syndrome, and the lack of reported neural tube closure and CNS patterning defects, retinitis pigmentosa or obesity suggests that the IC regulates a different and very specific set of ciliary functions. We note IC disruption having not been directly implicated in motile ciliary dysfunction. Notably, previous work in the inv/inv mouse demonstrated normal nodal ciliary motility but a defective nodal flow pattern22. At that time, an abnormally shaped node was hypothesized as the origin of the defective flow and heterotaxy, but more recently proposed models may justify revisiting nodal flow and signaling in the inv/inv mouse23","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25599650","rdfs:label":"Recessive mutations in Anks6/Nek8 cause laterality defects","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c14be93b-e269-40ea-b7f7-ae5fcb99e83f","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a2474eaa-49ec-405f-9060-cc519cc6042e","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Kidney cysts","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26039630","rdfs:label":"Kidney phenotype of ENU mutagenized ANKS6I747N mice","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0e1ccc94-3672-4602-af10-72529d440c23","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1f7bb504-569f-4dee-a800-decc802c9874","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Renal cysts","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23793029","rdfs:label":"missense ANKS6 Gln441Arg mutation ","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/62df8a40-0b65-46a4-89c8-51f26424c523_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/310ee7d9-cb9d-4131-90ab-b9c06d97ed75","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/67533a29-aad1-46c3-89ac-039df1ef6e15","type":"Finding","dc:description":"In order to identify interaction partners of NEK8, we performed large-scale immunoprecipitation (IP) experiments from mIMCD3 cells stably expressing FLAG-NEK8.

Her serum urea nitrogen (BuN) and creatinine (Scr) were elevated, at 77.1 mmol/L (normal range 1.7–7.1 mmol/L) and 846 μmol/L (normal range 30–84 μmol/L), respectively. Hemoglobin (HGB) was decreased, at 64 g/L (normal range 110–160 g/L). However, platelet (PLT) was normal, at 142 × 109/L (normal range 100–400 × 109/L) (Table 1). She was diagnosed with renal insufficiency. Her renal insufficiency deteriorated rapidly in a month and she was transferred to our hospital at the age of 3 years. The results of laboratory examinations at the age of 3 years were shown in Table 1. The patient had high levels of BuN (109.1 mmol/L), Scr (1208.66 μmol/L), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) (>35,000 pg/ml; normal range <450 pg/ml) and D-dimer (11.8 mg/L; normal range <0.5 mg/L). HGB decreased to 47 g/L and PLT decreased to 27 × 109/L. A renal ultrasound revealed bilateral enlarged kidneys, increased renal echogenicity with poorly defined cortico-medullary junction and no obvious cyst. Echocardiographic examination revealed interventricular septum and left ventricular hypertrophy. The radiographs of chest displayed increased lung marking and computed tomography scan of chest displayed pulmonary edema and effusion. The patient died at 3-year and 5-day old.","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001639","obo:HP_0000107","obo:HP_0012622"],"previousTesting":false,"sex":"Female","variant":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7e84bef3-1382-4e08-8220-7da288809196_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cc8777d6-d0bb-4896-ad60-21cab52bb182_variant_evidence_item"}]}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria","strengthScore":3.0},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2fdf5eb5-164e-46a4-995b-3c4bf50e3914_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4aafe236-56d5-4f9f-8a6f-6ccfc5c34d06","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":3.0,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4aafe236-56d5-4f9f-8a6f-6ccfc5c34d06_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23793029","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b1fe33c7-3215-454f-9f99-43942d9bf204","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_173551.5(ANKS6):c.1973-3C>G","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA144685"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":3.0},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2fdf5eb5-164e-46a4-995b-3c4bf50e3914","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23793029","rdfs:label":"A3114","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":4,"allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b1fe33c7-3215-454f-9f99-43942d9bf204"},"detectionMethod":"Mutation analysis was performed by different approaches. First, we used PCR-based 48.48 Access Array microfluidic technology (Fluidigm™) with consecutive next generation sequencing. We applied a 14-fold primer multiplexing approach allowing PCR-based amplification of 672 amplicons (592 exons) for 48 DNA samples simultaneously in 13 known and 19 NPHP candidate genes, including ANKS6. A total of 1056 patients with an NPH-related complex phenotype were analyzed. After 4 rounds of amplification followed by indexing of all 1056 patient-derived products with 384 different 10bp-barcodes in a subsequent PCR, 2×150 bidirectional sequencing was performed on 8 lanes of a GAIIx instrument (Illumina™). Bioinformatic analysis was conducted using CLC-Genomics-Workbench™ software. Second, all exons and adjacent intronic boundaries of 129 genes (including ANKS6, in total 2216 coding exons) known or hypothesized to cause ciliopathies were targeted by a custom SeqCap EZ choice sequence capture library (NimbleGen, Madison, Wisconsin, USA) and sequenced on a Roche 454 GS FLX or an Illumina MiSeq platform (2×150 PE). 268 patients with a (poly)cystic kidney disease phenotype or an NPH-related complex ciliopathy were analyzed with an average coverage of 60-fold (GS FLX) or 120-fold (MiSeq). Bioinformatic analysis was performed using the Roche GS Reference Mapper™ software (v2.6), SeqPilot SeqNext moduleTM (v3.5.2, JSI medical systems, Kippenheim, Germany) and an in-house bioinformatic pipeline. For both approaches, potential mutations were confirmed by Sanger sequencing and shown to segregate.
