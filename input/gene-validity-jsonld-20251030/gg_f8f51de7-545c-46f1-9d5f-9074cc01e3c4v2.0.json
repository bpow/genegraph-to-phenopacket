To date, the two unique missense variants described in a single affected individual in this initial report are the only variants associated with *RYR3* and autosomal recessive congenital myopathy and the impact of these variants on protein function is unclear. Some functional evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship exists, including protein expression data (PMID: 29498452) and functional alteration data from ryr3 knockout mice (PMIDs: 9384575 and 17412417) and RyR3-depleted zebrafish (PMID: 25667412). In summary, no convincing evidence for a causal role for *​RYR3​​* in ​autosomal recessive congenital myopathy has been reported. Although this gene-disease association is supported by relevant experimental evidence, the single report implicating *RYR3* in autosomal recessive congenital myopathy in humans is not sufficient to be scored as genetic evidence and the relationship between*RYR3* and autosomal recessive congenital myopathy is Disputed. More evidence is needed to either support or entirely refute the role *RYR3* plays in this disease.
