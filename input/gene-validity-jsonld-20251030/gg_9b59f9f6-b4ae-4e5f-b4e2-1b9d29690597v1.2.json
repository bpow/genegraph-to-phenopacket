It is characterized by mild, proximal, slowly progressive muscle weakness with onset ranging from birth to childhood. Variants in the *BIN1* gene have been reported in over twenty patients with autosomal recessive centronuclear myopathy in five different publications (PMIDs: 20142620, 17676042, 23754947, 21129173, 29950440). Eight unique variants (nonsense, splice site, and missense) predicted to cause a loss of function of the protein have been reported, suggesting homozygous loss of function the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease relationship is further supported by its biochemical function in the t-tublue system (PMID: 31857086), enhanced expression in skeletal muscle (PMID: 9182667), protein-protein interaction with *DNM2* (PMID: 15483625), and animal model studies (PMIDs: 23754947, 29130937, 11711432, 24549043). In summary, *BIN1* is definitively associated with autosomal recessive centronuclear myopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. \n\nOf note, *BIN1* has also been reported in relation to autosomal dominant centronuclear myopathy. Due to the proposed difference in mechanism, dominant negative, those cases were considered in a separate curation.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9b59f9f6-b4ae-4e5f-b4e2-1b9d29690597","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6d04cc64-0994-4579-99d5-bd2b89710173","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":[{"id":"cg:sopChange"},{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c4b0f110-f8ff-4814-98c7-faa78a7cba16_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10031","date":"2024-06-10T16:40:07.170Z","role":"Unpublisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6d04cc64-0994-4579-99d5-bd2b89710173_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10031","date":"2024-06-10T16:40:07.170Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6d04cc64-0994-4579-99d5-bd2b89710173_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10031","date":"2024-06-10T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6d04cc64-0994-4579-99d5-bd2b89710173_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6d04cc64-0994-4579-99d5-bd2b89710173_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5f8cf0d8-0822-4fd4-8424-31ffa2d51c10","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The Northern blot and in situ localization experiments in human tissue are in agreement with the enriched expression in skeletal muscle reported by HPA and GTEx.","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/be70fa9e-c688-44b6-8c91-be9d2db54de8","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Northern blot analysis of multiple diverse human tissues demonstrated marked enrichment of Amphiphysin II (BIN1) mRNA in skeletal muscle.
