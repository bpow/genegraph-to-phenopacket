PEX11A is a member of the PEX11 family, which is composed of membrane elongation factors involved in regulation of peroxisome maintenance and proliferation.\n\nPEX11A has not been reported in relation to human disease, to the best of our knowledge. Minimal evidence supporting the role of this gene in disease is available from experimental data. \n   \nSummary of experimental data (1 point):\nSince PEX11A has not been implicated in human disease, no mouse models that recapitulate a phenotype are reported. At least three Pex11a knock-out mouse models are reported, one of which is noted to show no external phenotypes or peroxisome defects (PMID: 12417726). Two other models by Weng et al (PMID: 23169785, PMID: 25113963) show the Pex11a deficiency may lead to alterations in peroxisome abundance, function and variability in expression of genes involved in fatty acid oxidation. The authors suggest that these are models for steatosis and hypertension/albuminuria.\n  \nIn summary, no convincing evidence for a causal role for PEX11A in autosomal recessive peroxisome biogenesis disorder has been reported. Although there is minimal evidence from animal models to support the role of PEX11A in disease, no reports have directly implicated the gene in humans.
