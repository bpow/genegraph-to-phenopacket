{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c6da5132-0128-456f-ab78-5a6eca594c49v1.1","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"CLIC2 was first reported in relation to X-linked complex neurodevelopmental disorder in 2012 by Takano et al., PMID: 22814392. The three individuals (from two unrelated families) reported to date in the literature with variants in this gene had  phenotypes including intellectual disability, delayed psychomotor development, seizures, and adult onset cardiac issues such as congestive heart failure, valvular insufficiency, atrial fibrillation, and cardiomegaly. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in molecular mechanism, inheritance pattern, or phenotypic variability. Therefore, for the purposes of this curation, all of the reported disease entities, including syndromic X-linked mental retardation-32 (OMIM # 300886) and X-linked intellectual disability-cardiomegaly-congestive heart failure syndrome (ORPHA:324410, MONDO:0010473) have been lumped into one disease entity: X-linked complex neurodevelopmental disorder. Although two unique variants (both missense) have been reported in humans, the first published variant (Takano et al., PMID: 22814392) has been ruled out from disease-causality based on the presence of this variant in adult males in the (non-neuro) gnomAD population database (v.2.1.1). Given the dearth of experimental evidence linking CLIC2 with disease, and the scarcity of plausible reports of disease-causing variants in humans, the ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism Working Group recommended awarding 0 points for the second published variant, a missense change with no supportive functional data (Vissers et al., PMID: 28333917). In summary, there is disputed evidence supporting  the relationship between CLIC2 and X-linked complex neurodevelopmental disorder. More evidence is needed to either support or refute the role CLIC2 plays in this disease. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism Working Group on 2/16/2021 (SOP Version 8).\n \n\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c6da5132-0128-456f-ab78-5a6eca594c49","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3e8ec6b8-5189-43eb-a741-833c77e7ce91","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"NoKnownDiseaseRelationship","changes":{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"},"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3e8ec6b8-5189-43eb-a741-833c77e7ce91_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2021-10-08T19:08:37.622Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3e8ec6b8-5189-43eb-a741-833c77e7ce91_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2021-02-16T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"Due to the scarcity of plausible reports of disease-causing variants, and the lack of compelling experimental evidence, the relationship between CLIC2 and X-linked complex neurodevelopmental disorder is disputed.","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3e8ec6b8-5189-43eb-a741-833c77e7ce91_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3e8ec6b8-5189-43eb-a741-833c77e7ce91_seg_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5951c431-2ed8-4fd2-8249-0aa39bf7fdb8_proband_segregation","type":"FamilyCosegregation","dc:description":"Per Gene Curation SOP (v8): \"For dominant or X-linked disorders, the estimated LOD score should be calculated using ONLY families with 4 or more segregations present.\" This family has < 4 segregations, thus not using.
