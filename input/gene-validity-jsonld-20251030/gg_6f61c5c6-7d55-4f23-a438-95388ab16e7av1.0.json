PTCD3 was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Leigh syndrome spectrum in 2019 (Borna et al., PMID 30607703). There are no variants in this gene listed in ClinVar. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data (PMID 30607703) to reach a case-level evidence score of 2.5 points. This gene-disease association is further supported by the function of the gene product and expression studies, reaching an experimental score of 2 points. The mechanism for disease is impaired mitochondrial translation. In summary, PTCD3 currently has a limited association with autosomal recessive Leigh syndrome spectrum. This classification was approved by the NICHD U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on June 10, 2019 (SOP Version 6).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6f61c5c6-7d55-4f23-a438-95388ab16e7a","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ac3d1e08-56f0-43b6-a2fa-0d06571ba121","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ac3d1e08-56f0-43b6-a2fa-0d06571ba121_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2019-06-20T16:44:19.242Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ac3d1e08-56f0-43b6-a2fa-0d06571ba121_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ac3d1e08-56f0-43b6-a2fa-0d06571ba121_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9d67451f-24ac-4ee6-89db-04f12309ec6e_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"c.415- 2A>G is a spice site variant leading to deletion of exon 7 resulting in a shorter protein. c.1747_1748insCT variant in exon 21 is a frameshift mutation predicted to cause a premature stop codon (p.Phe583Serfs*3) resulting in a shorter mutant protein.
