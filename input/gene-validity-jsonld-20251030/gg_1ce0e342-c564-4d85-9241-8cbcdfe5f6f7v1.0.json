At least 2 unique loss of function variants have been reported in humans (26282398, 28281779). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in additional family members. This gene-disease association is supported by a knock-out mouse model and relevant expression studies. In summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease association. While more evidence is needed to establish this association definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hearing Loss Working Group on 2/5/2020.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1ce0e342-c564-4d85-9241-8cbcdfe5f6f7","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e0022ad7-8497-4139-94a7-2546ba482c88","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e0022ad7-8497-4139-94a7-2546ba482c88_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2020-02-05T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e0022ad7-8497-4139-94a7-2546ba482c88_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e0022ad7-8497-4139-94a7-2546ba482c88_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a8d419ec-bd50-45fd-83ea-a59c03a1eef8_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Variant is absent from gnomAD.
