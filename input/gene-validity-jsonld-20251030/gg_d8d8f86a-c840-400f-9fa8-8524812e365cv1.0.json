While various names have been given to the constellation of features seen in those with *SCO1*-related disease, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *SCO1* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included six unique variants, including two frameshift truncating variants shown to undergo nonsense mediated decay, three missense variants, and one in-frame deletion, in four probands across four publications (PMIDs: 11013136, 19295170, 23878101, 31352446). *SCO1* pathogenic variants were first described in an infant with respiratory distress, metabolic acidosis, hepatic failure, and encephalopathy in the setting of profound complex IV deficiency in muscle and liver.  Subsequent publications have shown expansion of the phenotypic spectrum including cardiomyopathy in one case and one case of encephalopathy and lactic acidosis without cardiac or hepatic involvement. Many cases reported to date have been fatal in the first few months of life. Of note, one report showed segregation in four affected family members (including two fetuses with isolated complex IV deficiency by chorionic villus sampling) and non-segregation in two unaffected siblings, which reached a LOD score of 2.06, which was sufficient to count in the case estimate (0.5 points; PMID:11013136). The total score for case-level data was 8.9 points, 8.4 of which was attributed to the four probands, three of which had extensive functional evidence to support the pathogenicity of their variants, including supportive respiratory chain enzyme assays, tissue copper studies, and western blots, as well as qPCR studies on cDNA. Loss-of-function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease association is also supported by known biochemical function, functional alteration in patient cells, rescue in patient cells, and animal models (PMIDs: 23878101, 19295170, 28973536, 25683716). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for experimental evidence (6 points) has been reached.\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support this gene-disease relationship, including that more than three years have elapsed since the first proposal of the association. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on February 17, 2022 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d8d8f86a-c840-400f-9fa8-8524812e365c","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/90d9d757-a45e-4d35-af68-c1345e1d8c65","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/90d9d757-a45e-4d35-af68-c1345e1d8c65_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2022-07-01T20:52:08.344Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/90d9d757-a45e-4d35-af68-c1345e1d8c65_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2022-02-17T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/90d9d757-a45e-4d35-af68-c1345e1d8c65_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/90d9d757-a45e-4d35-af68-c1345e1d8c65_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cefd3878-3248-47ff-b95e-c0664502ec35","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Phenotype is variable across patient so 0.5 awarded for liver changes consistent with mitochondrial hepatopathy\n+ 0.5 awarded for COX deficiency and Cu deficiency in liver","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cfbbee8d-ce53-4867-947d-61bec8af2620","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Liver-specific Sco1 knockout mice exhibited normal weight gain for roughly the first\n28 days of life, but failed to thrive thereafter, with subsequent weight loss producing a runted phenotype (Figures 1A and 1B).\n\nLiver-specific Sco1 knockout mice had a median life expectancy of 70 days (c2 analysis, p < 0.0001) (Figure 1C), which was associated with the loss of immunologically detectable SCO1 in the\nliver (Figure 1D).\n\nTransmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses revealed that the spotty nature of Sco1-null livers was attributable to an increase in lipid droplet accumulation...
