{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/57cb24af-569a-485a-8f9a-6d41a03d315fv1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"The relationship between COQ9 and Leigh syndrome spectrum was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of September 21, 2020. The COQ9 gene encodes an enzyme critical for the synthesis of coenzyme Q10. Coenzyme Q10 is critical for many processes in the cell, including in the mitochondrial respiratory chain transferring electrons from complexes I and II to complex III.\n\nThe COQ9 gene has been reported only once in relation to autosomal recessive Leigh syndrome spectrum, in 2018 (PMID: 29560582). There was another case reported with brain ultrasound findings reported by the authors to be consistent with Leigh syndrome spectrum; however this expert panel considered that there are too many confounding factors in ultrasonography to confirm the presence of brain lesions consistent with Leigh syndrome spectrum. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included two variants identified in one case in one publication (PMID: 29560582). No segregation data were available. Loss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease association is also supported by biochemical function, expression, functional alteration in patient cells, and animal models (PMIDs: 19375058, 25613900, 20495179, 25802402, 23255162).\n\nIn summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although the total score (8) falls in the moderate range, only one case with Leigh syndrome spectrum has been reported, therefore this gene-disease association can only reach a limited classification at this time. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on September 21, 2020 (SOP Version 7).\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/57cb24af-569a-485a-8f9a-6d41a03d315f","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cebc5501-5d36-4767-98bc-edc4ddab3527","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cebc5501-5d36-4767-98bc-edc4ddab3527_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2021-04-09T14:06:48.254Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cebc5501-5d36-4767-98bc-edc4ddab3527_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2021-04-09T14:06:34.407Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"Although the total score (8) falls in the moderate range, only one case with Leigh syndrome spectrum has been reported, therefore this gene-disease association can only reach a limited classification at this time","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cebc5501-5d36-4767-98bc-edc4ddab3527_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cebc5501-5d36-4767-98bc-edc4ddab3527_seg_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/08bbb1bd-6c48-4d05-8e32-192dc374888d_proband_segregation","type":"FamilyCosegregation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29560582","rdfs:label":"Smith Family","estimatedLodScore":1.81,"family":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/08bbb1bd-6c48-4d05-8e32-192dc374888d","type":"Family","rdfs:label":"Smith Family","ethnicity":{"id":"cg:NotHispanicOrLatino"},"member":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3105e655-0fc7-456a-bf0d-f7c7e1163f66","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29560582","rdfs:label":"Patient 3","firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"The baby was extubated and died shortly thereafter at 12 h of age.
