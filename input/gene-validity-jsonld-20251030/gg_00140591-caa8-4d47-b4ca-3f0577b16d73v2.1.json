The gene is also associated with Muscular dystrophy-dystroglycanopathy (limb-girdle), type 3C, and referred to as LGMD2O and LGMD R15 *POMGNT1*-related in the literature (PMID: 30055862). However, the two individuals reported with the LGMD phenotype do not meet the LGMD GCEP's phenotype criteria. Therefore, the LGMD phenotype, although potentially part of the spectrum, has not been described in individuals with *POMGNT1* variants. The association myopathy caused by variation in *POMGNT1* was made using case-level and experimental data. The *POMGNT1* gene is located on chromosome 1p34.1 and encodes multiple transcript variants. The commonly referred transcript (NM_017739.3) is 2.7 kb long with 22 exons encoding a 660-amino acid protein. More than 100 pathogenic variants reported in humans with autosomal recessive myopathy caused by variation in *POMGNT1* are recorded in ClinVar, ranging from small deletions and duplications, nonsense, frameshift and splicing to missense variants. Myopathy caused by variation in *POMGNT1* encompasses a spectrum of phenotypes including severe forms with muscle-eye-brain disease, Walker-Warburg syndrome and muscular dystrophy dystroglycanopathy with intellectual disability. Patients often show an elevated serum creatine kinase and progressive muscle weakness. *POMGNT1* has been reported in association with autosomal recessive myopathy caused by variation in *POMGNT1* as early as 2001 by Yoshida et al (PMID: 11709191).\n \nOMIM entities: Muscular dystrophy-dystroglycanopathy (congenital with brain and eye anomalies), type A, 3; Muscular dystrophy-dystroglycanopathy (congenital with mental retardation), type B, 3; Muscular dystrophy-dystroglycanopathy (limb-girdle), type C, 3; Retinitis pigmentosa 76.\n \nPer criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in molecular mechanism(s) AND inheritance pattern AND phenotypic variability in the above mentioned disease entities. Therefore, all of the disease entities may be lumped into one disease entity, autosomal recessive myopathy caused by variation in *POMGNT1*. However, the patients with an asserted LGMD phenotype do not meet the GCEP-specific LGMD phenotype criteria and therefore are not scored. Similarly, individuals with isolated retinitis pigmentosa are not scored.\n\nSummary of Case Level Data (12 points): The association is seen in at least 7 probands in 4 publications (PMID: 11709191, 12588800, 12788071, 22419172). *POMGNT1* variants are also reported in patients with isolated Retinitis Pigmentosa without other syndromic features (PMID: 26908613). These probands are noted but not scored in this curation. More case-level evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts) has been reached.\n \nThe mechanism for disease is expected to be biallelic loss of function. \n \nSummary of Experimental Data (5.5 points): This gene-disease relationship is supported by animal models, expression studies, functional assays and rescue evidence. *POMGNT1* catalyzes the transfer of N-acetylglucosamine to O-mannose of alpha-dystroglycan and interacts with other proteins in the glycosylation pathway of alpha-dystroglycan in skeletal muscle (PMID: 16584074, 17034757, 17869517, 23454088). *POMGNT1* is expressed ubiquitously, including the retinal photoreceptors and brain, localizing to the Golgi complex and the nucleus (PMID: 27375352). Mouse models with *POMGNT1* knocked out recapitulate the human muscle-eye-brain disease phenotype (PMID: 16458488, 23454088, 19114101).\n \nIn summary, the gene-disease relationship between *POMGNT1* and myopathy caused by variation in *POMGNT1* is definitive. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy GCEP on August 11, 2020 (SOP Version 7).\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/00140591-caa8-4d47-b4ca-3f0577b16d73","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/03bb8479-2ed3-4b15-9e54-378ea0729ab2","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":[{"id":"cg:newEvidence"},{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"},{"id":"cg:expertPanelChange"},{"id":"cg:classificationChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/03bb8479-2ed3-4b15-9e54-378ea0729ab2_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10151","date":"2024-08-14T19:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/03bb8479-2ed3-4b15-9e54-378ea0729ab2_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10151","date":"2024-08-14T19:24:19.117Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["ErrorClarification"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/03bb8479-2ed3-4b15-9e54-378ea0729ab2_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f16b4914-f04c-44fd-afe8-df806b0ae5ef_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f16b4914-f04c-44fd-afe8-df806b0ae5ef","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12588800","rdfs:label":"Taniguchi_Patient EV","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":12,"allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/044e3cfa-792b-4c80-80ee-a7395ea117ae","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_017739.4(POMGNT1):c.187C>T (p.Arg63Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA116550"}},"detectionMethod":"The entire coding region (ex 1-22) and intron-exon flanking sequences of POMGNT1 were amplified and directly sequenced.","firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypeFreeText":"Proband was hospitalized at 1yo for a ventriculoperitoneal shunt surgery for hydrocephalus.
