The enzyme causes hydrolysis of glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) into glucose during the terminal steps of gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis (Shieh et al. 2002; Udawat et al. 2019).  Glycogen storage disease type Ia (GSD-Ia, MIM232200) also known as von Gierke disease, is caused by deleterious mutations in the *G6PC1* gene. Patients with GSD-Ia experience growth retardation, hypoglycaemia during fasting, and increased serum levels of uric acid, triglycerides, and cholesterol (Wang et al. 2013). The *G6PC1* gene is expressed in the liver, kidney, and intestine, and these are the only organs that release glucose into the blood circulation. G6Pasedeficiency also leads to the accumulation of glucose-6 phosphate (G6P), glycogen, and triglycerides in the liver and kidneys of patients. This results in marked hepatomegaly and nephromegaly.\n\nIn this curation, 21 variants (missense, nonsense, frameshift), reported in 15 probands in 10 publications (PMID:17607665, 11196115, 11058918, 32436859, 10234610, 10797430, 27139513, 35834487, 8739966, 27511118) are included. GSD-Ia is not more prevalent in any ethnic group, but mutations unique to Caucasian, oriental, and Jewish populations have been described. GSD-Ia patients have been seen to exhibit phenotypic heterogeneity. Among these variants, p.R170X (PMID: 10797430) has been functionally characterized and completely inactivates the G6PC enzyme. The variant p.R83C (PMID:10797430) is identified as the most prevalent mutation in Caucasian and Jewish GSD-Ia patients.  In Chinese patients the most prevalent mutations are p.R83H (PMID:324685) and c.648G>T (PMID:10797430). \n\nThe experimental evidence that support gene-disease relation include biochemical function analysis, functional alteration and animal models (PMID: 12093795, 10738525,8640227, 33359667, 21109326).  The study by Ghosh et al., (PMID:12093795), reported the crucial role of His176 in G6Pase catalysis where this His residue in G6Pase becomes phosphorylated generating an enzyme-phosphate intermediate showing that substituting His176 with an Ala residue also completely abolished G6Pase activity, a feature in GSD Ia patients. Functional alteration study was carried out using the hGlc6Pase cDNA cloned in pSVK3 (expression plasmid) which were transfected into COS7 cells. Glc6Pase activity of hGlc6Pase after insertion of the fourpoint mutations which were previously identified in French patients, e.g. W77R, A124T, G184E and L211P were analyzed both in terms of maximal velocity (Vmax) and Glc6P affinity (Km), in comparison with Glc6Pase assayed in microsomes isolated from normal human liver and kidney. None of the four new hGlc6Pase mutants exhibited a Glc6Pase activity higher than that of untransfected COS-7 cells (PMID:107538525). In mouse model study by Mutel et al., G6pc- / mice which were generated by an inducible CRE (CRE ERT2) strategy, demonstrated hyperlipidemia, lactic acidosis, and uricemia, hepatomegaly and steatosis (PMID:21109326). Another mouse model study by Arnaoutova et al., (PMID: 33359667) CRISPR/Cas9-based technology to generate a G6pc-R83C mouse line homozygous for G6PC-p.R83C. It was seen that G6pc-R83C mice were devoid of hepatic and renal G6Pase-α activity and died prematurely, and manifested impaired glucose homeostasis and frequent hypoglycemic seizures, like the symptoms of the global G6pc−/− mice (Lei KJ, 1996)(PMID:8640227), essentially the same pathophysiology as human GSD-Ia patients.\n\nIn summary, *G6PC1* is definitively associated with autosomal recessive glycogen storage disease Ia and has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnosis settings. This classification was approved by the ClinGen General Inborn Errors of Metabolism GCEP on the meeting date [09/27/2024] (SOP Version 10).\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/efa3156f-827b-4af6-a982-3219b0ab47a3","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/951fef4e-a9ac-400c-b94a-5d6531086d9f","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/951fef4e-a9ac-400c-b94a-5d6531086d9f_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10097","date":"2024-10-10T18:03:27.548Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/951fef4e-a9ac-400c-b94a-5d6531086d9f_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10097","date":"2024-09-27T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration","ErrorClarification"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/951fef4e-a9ac-400c-b94a-5d6531086d9f_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e667d720-10fd-4015-8e29-29be0954df6d_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e667d720-10fd-4015-8e29-29be0954df6d","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10234610","rdfs:label":"1999_parvari_01","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":6,"allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/33ef752e-7969-4ef3-98d2-36d9d97dc450","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000151.4(G6PC1):c.809G>T (p.Gly270Val)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA341569"}},"detectionMethod":"Extraction of DNA and PCR amplification with Single-stranded conformation polymorphism (SSCP).\nG270V mutation in GSD1a 151\nFigure 1 SSCP analysis of exon 5 of the patients (P1, P2 and P3) and their parents (M-\nmother, F-father) in comparison to a healthy individual (C)\ntriglycerides 1832 mg/dL, uric acid 0.71 mmol/L, lactate 3.8 mmol/L, SGOT 32 U/L,\nSGPT 30 U/L ; urine analysis is normal.\nMETHODS\nExtraction of DNA and PCR ampliÐcation were performed as described elsewhere\n(Parvari et al 1995).

Moreover, the G6pc-R83C mice manifested impaired glucose homeostasis and frequent hypoglycemic seizures, like the symptoms of the global G6pc−/− mice (Lei KJ, 1996). The G6pc-R83C mice manifested essentially the same pathophysiology as human GSD-Ia patients, characterized by hypoglycemia, growth retardation, hepatomegaly, nephromegaly, hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia, and hyperuricemia. The glycogen storages in the mice are markedly increased in liver hepatocytes and renal tubular epithelial cells, like that seen in human GSD-Ia patients.

Accumulation of triglycerides in L-G6pc / livers also increased with time. Histological observations of L-G6pc / livers confirmed marked steatosis, with\n large hepatocytes containing large lipid vacuoles, mainly in the\n periportal area. As a result, the portal space was small and distorted. Marked glycogen accumulation was also observed by periodic acid-Schiff staining. L-G6Ppc / mice have all hepatic symptoms of the human pathology, including hepatomegaly, steatosis, and glycogen overload. L-G6pc / mice also have the expected dysregulations of plasma metabolites related to liver function such as triglycerides, cholesterol, lactic and uric acid.
