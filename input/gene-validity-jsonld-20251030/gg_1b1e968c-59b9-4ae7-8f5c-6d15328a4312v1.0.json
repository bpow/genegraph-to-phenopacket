{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1b1e968c-59b9-4ae7-8f5c-6d15328a4312v1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"The *GUCY2D* gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive cases of Leber congenital amaurosis in 1996 (Perrault et al., PMID: 8944027). Affected individuals have since been identified in a number of other publications (PMID: 16505055, PMID: 29559409, PMID: 23035049), with causal biallelic variants in *GUCY2D* specifically diagnostic for either Leber congenital amaurosis 1 (more severe) or congenital stationary night blindness type 1I (milder and later onset). Both disease entities are completely penetrant, however, patients diagnosed with Leber congenital amaurosis 1 present with severe visual impairment before the age of 5 (usually during the first year of life) while their counterparts with congenital stationary night blindness type 1I are diagnosed between the ages of 9 and 45, presenting with night blindness since childhood and gradual progression to mild retinal dystrophy (PMID: 29559409). Patients with Leber congenital amaurosis 1 also exhibit other eye-specific features, including nystagmus, photophobia, strabismus, eye poking, keratoconus, attenuation of retinal blood vessels, optic disc pallor, and mild retinal pigment epithelium mottling, often with a relatively normal appearance to the fundus. Patients with congenital stationary night blindness type 1I exhibit only a subset of these features, including attenuation of retinal blood vessels and progressive visual field constriction. Electroretinogram (ERG) response is nondetectable in Leber congenital amaurosis 1 patients, however, those with congenital stationary night blindness type 1I initially exhibit nondetectable responses only in rod-based ERG, while cone-based ERG responses may remain normal until the third decade of life or later. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found the molecular mechanism (biallelic loss of function in the GUCY2D gene product) and mode of inheritance (autosomal recessive) to be consistent among unrelated patients diagnosed with either Leber congenital amaurosis 1 or congenital stationary night blindness type 1I, while the phenotypic variability between them appeared to represent a spectrum of disease rather than separate disease entities. Therefore, cases of Leber congenital amaurosis 1 or congenital stationary night blindness type 1I have been lumped into a single disease entity, referred to as *GUCY2D*-related recessive retinopathy (MONDO:0100453). Two additional disease entities, cone-rod dystrophy 6 and central areolar choroidal dystrophy 1, were asserted in relation to monoallelic variants in *GUCY2D*, particularly those located in the dimerization domain (PMID: 11115851, PMID: 11709018, PMID: 29061346). While these disease entities are characterized by similar phenotypes, their different mode of inheritance and unique variants suggested a different mechanism of pathogenesis. Thus, *GUCY2D* was separately curated for its relationship to this disease entity, referred to as *GUCY2D*-related dominant retinopathy (MONDO:0100441).\n\nEight suspected pathogenic variants were scored as part of this curation (two nonsense, one frameshift, and five missense), which have been collectively reported in twelve probands in three publications (PMID: 8944027, PMID: 16505055, PMID: 29559409). Eight probands were homozygous for their respective variants (PMID: 8944027, PMID: 16505055), and five were reported to have consanguineous parents (PMID: 8944027, PMID: 16505055). The four other probands were compound heterozygotes within the *GUCY2D* locus (PMID: 16505055, PMID: 29559409). Two families with segregation evidence were available in these publications (PMID: 8944027), and contributed to the scoring of the gene-disease relationship. More case-level data was available (PMID: 23035049, PMID: 29559409), but was not scored as part of this curation as the maximum scoring for this evidence type had already been reached.\n\nThis gene-disease relationship has not been studied in case-control studies at the single variant level or aggregate variant level.\n\nThe mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be biallelic loss of function, characterized in some cases by frameshift or nonsense variants predicted to trigger a decrease in the amount of the gene product (PMID: 8944027, PMID: 29559409). All probands found for this curation harbored two variant alleles within the *GUCY2D* locus.\n\nThis gene-disease association is also supported by experimental evidence that *GUCY2D* expression is dramatically higher in the retina relative to control tissues (PMID: 30239781), particularly along the retinal outer nuclear layer (PMID: 1356371). Proper subcellular localization of GUCY2D protein requires its C-terminus to physically interact with the RD3 protein, which is encoded by a gene that harbors causal variants for Leber congenital amaurosis 12 (PMID: 21078983). Biochemical studies have demonstrated that *GUCY2D* encodes a receptor guanylyl cyclase that catalyzes cGMP production as part of the recovery of the dark state following visual excitation (PMID: 1356371). This helps explain why chickens homozygous for a null variant of the *GUCY2D* ortholog exhibit dramatically reduced cGMP levels within the retina, nondetectable ERG responses from rod and cone photoreceptors, early onset blindness, and optokinetic reflex abnormalities analogous to nystagmus (PMID: 9448321). Similarly, mice with homozygous knockout of *Gucy2e* (the murine *GUCY2D* ortholog) exhibit degeneration and loss of cone photoreceptor cells in the outer nuclear layer, nondetectable cone-based ERG responses, reduced amplitude of rod-based ERG responses, and loss of visual acuity (PMID: 10407028, PMID: 17255100, PMID: 21671801). Rod photoreceptor function has been shown to be relatively preserved in these mice due to their dependence on a gene paralog (PMID: 17255100). These mouse phenotypes can be partially rescued by injection of adeno-associated virus (AAV) delivering wild-type human *GUCY2D* or mouse *Gucy2e*.\n\nIn summary, *GUCY2D* is definitively associated with *GUCY2D*-related recessive retinopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both research and diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time without the emergence of contradictory evidence, leading to a definitive classification.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1b1e968c-59b9-4ae7-8f5c-6d15328a4312","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/dcb8350d-c57f-43e3-9e9f-d059ebbf61c9","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/dcb8350d-c57f-43e3-9e9f-d059ebbf61c9_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10072","date":"2022-03-27T23:22:10.761Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/dcb8350d-c57f-43e3-9e9f-d059ebbf61c9_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10072","date":"2022-03-27T23:22:23.362Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/dcb8350d-c57f-43e3-9e9f-d059ebbf61c9_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a998f954-0559-4471-a22f-c23c66ef075a_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/76d12b78-0dc6-49d4-a13c-5d48e3d7d854","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The variant has been moderately up-scored to reflect its predicted deleterious effect on catalytic activity and its recurrent detection in a homozygous state in affected individuals from multiple families.

The absence of more severe rod defects is explained by a mouse-specific expression pattern of a gene paralog. Mice and humans with loss-of-function both exhibit some defects in retinal morphology as well. By 5 weeks of age, Gucy2e-deficient animals exhibit dramatic reduction/degeneration of cones in the outer nuclear layer (Fig. 3a–d). This was confirmed by disappearance of labeling of cone cell nuclei by the lectin PNA (Fig. 3g-h). ERG showed that rod a-wave and b-wave were markedly reduced by 1 month of age, while cone responses were nondetectable as early as 2 months of age (Fig. 4a-b). A proposed explanation for the absence of more severe rod defects is the continued presence of the Gucy2f paralog in this mouse model, which may compensate for the absence of Gucy2e function in rod cells specifically.
