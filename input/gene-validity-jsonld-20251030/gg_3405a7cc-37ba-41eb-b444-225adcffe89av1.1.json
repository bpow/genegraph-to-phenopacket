OAT encodes ornithine aminotransferase, a mitochondrial enzyme that catalyzes the pyridoxal 5′-phosphate-dependent transformation of L-ornithine to L-glutamate 5-semialdehyde, which spontaneously forms pyrroline-5-carboxylate. Variants in OAT causing gyrate atrophy were first reported in 1988 (Ramesh et al, PMID 3375240; Mitchel et al, PMID 3339136). Hyperornithininemia is a consistent biochemical finding in these patients. Data from 10 patients with 13 unique variants (missense, nonsense, frameshift, splicing, large deletion) from 6 publications were curated (Mitchel et al, 1988, PMID 3339136; Ramesh et al, 1988, PMID 3375240; Mitchel et al, 1989, PMID 2492100; Mashima et al, 1992, PMID 1609808; Doimo et al, 2013, PMID 23076989; Katagiri et al, 2014, PMID 24429551). Additional cases are available in the literature but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. Of note, rare individuals with OAT deficiency have been reported who presented with hyperammonemia and low ornithine in the neonatal period, later developing hyperornithinemia (Cleary et al, 2005, PMID 16151897; Zubarioglu et al, 2016; PMID 27037922). While these individuals had no signs of gyrate atrophy, it is possible that it may develop later in life. \nThe relationship between OAT and gyrate atrophy is supported by extensive experimental evidence including the biochemical function of ornithine aminotransferase, which is consistent with the biochemical features of the disease (Juncosa et al, 2103, PMID 23747282), expression of OAT in the retina (Bernstein et al, 1988, PMID  9815288), functional studies in patient and non-patient cells (Heinänen et al, 1988, PMID 9727717; Montioli et al, 2018, PMID 30251682), as well as the phenotype in naturally-occurring and knock-out mouse models (Bisaillon et al, 2014, PMID 25264521; Wang et al, 1995, PMID  7550347; Wang et al, 2000, PMID 10655512). In summary, OAT is definitively associated with gyrate atrophy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. The classification was approved by the ClinGen Aminoacidopathy Gene Curation Expert Panel.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3405a7cc-37ba-41eb-b444-225adcffe89a","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/edbab666-9ae6-46db-b818-809a4bf8333e","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"},"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/edbab666-9ae6-46db-b818-809a4bf8333e_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10011","date":"2020-09-16T19:23:07.481Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/edbab666-9ae6-46db-b818-809a4bf8333e_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10011","date":"2019-07-10T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/edbab666-9ae6-46db-b818-809a4bf8333e_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/23beb0f0-3e35-4cf1-a585-a32484dc235c_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"This individual is homozygous for a missense variant in OAT, c.162C>A (p.Asn54Lys).

Regarding retinal histology, little information is available for human with gyrate atrophy to compare to the retinal findings reported in this study. However, one report on a 98-year-old patient with B6-responsive OAT deficiency found a small, isolated central area of functional retina surrounded by large areas totally devoid of choroid and retinal layers, consistent with the retinal degeneration noted in the knock out mice.

In addition, analysis of retinas from knock out mice revealed retinal degeneration consistent gyrate atrophy. There were remarkable similarities in plasma amino acid levels with about 10 times increase in ornithine level and about 2 times decrease in lysine in knock mice and humans with OAT deficiency. Particularly striking, the first report of amino acid levels in a human patient with OAT deficiency (younger sibling of an affected patient, diagnosed prenatally), revealed low ornithine early in life (at 2-4 months of age), with mild hyperammonemia by 4 months. Thus, in both knock out mice and humans with OAT deficiency, ornithine is low early in life, but later increases and becomes elevated.
