{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/22bd43ca-2acd-4930-959f-780f8a12c1dev1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"Actinopathy is a musculoskeletal system disorder that covers a wide spectrum of phenotypes and is caused by pathogenic variants in the skeletal muscle α-actin gene, *ACTA1*. These variants lead to a variety of overlapping adult onset and congenital myopathies characterized by muscle weakness, hypotonia, myopathic facies, respiratory dysfunction, and rarely cardiac involvement. While nemaline myopathy is the most common presentation, several other myopathies have been reported in association with *ACTA1* mutations. Specific skeletal muscle structural lesions visible on muscle biopsy include actin accumulations, nemaline and intranuclear bodies, fiber-type disproportion, cores, caps, dystrophic features and zebra bodies. Disorders associated with *ACTA1* pathogenic variants can have autosomal dominant (90%) or recessive (10%) inheritance. Per criteria outlined by the Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found differences in molecular mechanism (dominant negative vs. recessive loss of function) and inheritance pattern actinopathy was split into dominant and recessive curations.\n\n*ACTA1* was first reported in relation to recessive actinopathy in 1999 (Nowak KJ, et al., 1999, PMID: 10508519). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data. Biallelic loss of function variants (splicing, frameshift, nonsense, and missense) in this gene have been reported in at least 7 probands in 5 publications (PMIDs: 10508519, 12921789, 15236405, 17187373, 24447884). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in at least 4 additional family members. More evidence may be available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence has been reached. This gene disease association is supported by its biochemical function in muscle contraction (PMID: 21314430), its skeletal muscle specific expression (PMID: 1743394), and a null mouse model (PMID: 12138199) that partially recapitulates human disease. In summary *ACTA1* is definitively associated with recessive inheritance of actinopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/22bd43ca-2acd-4930-959f-780f8a12c1de","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/098a7b3a-26ab-4915-8187-f6db682cef4f","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/098a7b3a-26ab-4915-8187-f6db682cef4f_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10031","date":"2024-02-26T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/098a7b3a-26ab-4915-8187-f6db682cef4f_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10031","date":"2024-02-26T14:29:53.758Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/098a7b3a-26ab-4915-8187-f6db682cef4f_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e2b761e5-2e7f-4587-b86a-64c35fccdaa8_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b4c97d03-af3e-46a4-8f9f-b035e33d1fe3","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"This maternal frameshift occurs in the penultimate exon and is not predicted to trigger NMD.
