SUGCT catalyzes the succinyl-CoA-dependent conversion of glutaric acid into glutaryl-CoA preventing urinary loss of the organic acid; in patients with deficiency of SUGCT there is a consequent accumulation of glutaric acid. Glutaric aciduria type 3 is a biochemical phenotype with uncertain clinical relevance. Evidence supporting the relationship between *SUGCT* and glutaric acidemia type 3 includes case-level data and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 12 probands in 6 publications (PMIDs: 18926513, 28766179, 29421601, 2779420, 37920852, 39101156). At least 7 unique missense, nonsense, and frameshift variants have been reported in humans. This gene-disease relationship is supported by the biochemical function of *SUGCT* which is consistent with the biochemical abnormalities observed in individuals with glutaric acidemia type 3 (PMID: 23893049) and the biochemical features of a Sugct knockout mouse (PMID: 31722069). In summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged.\n\nThis gene-disease pair was previously evaluated by the Aminoacidopathy GCEP on 09/25/2020. It was reevaluated on 10/14/2022 and 12/10/2024 which identified three additional cases (PMIDs:  37920852, 39101156). As a result of this reevaluation, the classification remained Moderate.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e646d61b-3506-41fd-bb84-6387d614814e","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/10622f19-d307-4fa8-b3ff-a799922e7fea","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","changes":[{"id":"cg:sopChange"},{"id":"cg:newEvidence"},{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"},{"id":"cg:summaryChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/10622f19-d307-4fa8-b3ff-a799922e7fea_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10011","date":"2024-12-13T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/10622f19-d307-4fa8-b3ff-a799922e7fea_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10011","date":"2024-12-13T18:53:23.860Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["RecurationNewEvidence","RecurationTiming"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/10622f19-d307-4fa8-b3ff-a799922e7fea_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f85f0dce-df86-42d0-bcc6-2fdf08f92a72_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f85f0dce-df86-42d0-bcc6-2fdf08f92a72","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28766179","rdfs:label":"Patient 3","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":4,"allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/880ccaa8-d8dd-4cf1-a4b2-55206b4308ff","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001193313.2(SUGCT):c.985C>T (p.Arg329Trp)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA115225"}},"detectionMethod":"unspecified","phenotypeFreeText":"Glutaric acid 9-398 mmol/mol creatinine (reference limit 22).
