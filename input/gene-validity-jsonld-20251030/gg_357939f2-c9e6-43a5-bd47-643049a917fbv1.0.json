TRIM37 encodes a member of the tripartite motif family. Mulibrey nanism is a multi-organ defect affecting the muscles, liver, brain, eye (Braverman et al, 2012, Gene Reviews) and characterized by severe growth failure of prenatal onset, characteristic dysmorphic features, perimyocardial heart disease, metabolic syndrome and hepatomegaly (Kallijarvi et al, 2006; PMID: 16514549). \n\nTRIM37 was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive mulibrey nanism in 2000. (Avela et al, PMID: 10888877). At least 20 nonsense, splice site, frameshift, deletion/duplication and missense variants have been reported in humans in the ClinVar database. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data.  \n   \nSummary of Case Level Data (12 points):\nVariants in this gene have been reported in at least 8 probands in 4 publications (PMID: 27256967, 17100991, 15108285, 10888877). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score (12 points) for genetic evidence is reached. Two founder mutations in the Finnish population have been described: c.493-2A>G, referred to as the Finnish major mutation is most frequently seen, and Glu738fs, referred to as the Finnish minor mutation. \nThe mechanism for disease is expected to be biallelic loss of function.  \n  \nSummary of experimental data (2 points):\nThis gene-disease association is supported by in vitro functional assays and animal models. TRIM37 is shown to partially localize with the proxisome and interact with PEX5 to ubiquitylate it. Depletion of TRIM37 is shown to result in peroxisomal matrix protein import defect (PMID: 28724525). Mouse models of TRIM37 recapitulate the human disease; however no overt peroxisome pathology is noted (PMID: 27044324).  \n  \nIn summary, TRIM37 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive mulibrey nanism. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Peroxisomal Disorders GCEP on May 1, 2020 (SOP Version 7).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/357939f2-c9e6-43a5-bd47-643049a917fb","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0faa569d-4e0c-4809-a1b2-a93d460751e8","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0faa569d-4e0c-4809-a1b2-a93d460751e8_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10049","date":"2021-07-30T16:27:55.691Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0faa569d-4e0c-4809-a1b2-a93d460751e8_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10049","date":"2020-05-01T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0faa569d-4e0c-4809-a1b2-a93d460751e8_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/20df3841-cd07-4dbf-bd45-8c8960f669ab_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The proband was homozygous for the 1-bp duplication in exon 15 that causes a frameshift and early termination at amino acid position 458.

Eye exam revealed visual acuity 20/22; fundus with a slightly hyperemic optic disk in both eyes and blurred margins in the left eye, dystrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium and yellowish dots in the retinal mid‐peripheral region in both eyes.","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0000331","obo:HP_0002007","obo:HP_0002240","obo:HP_0008436","obo:HP_0005280","obo:HP_0002119","obo:HP_0000256","obo:HP_0100039","obo:HP_0004209","obo:HP_0001655","obo:HP_0000307","obo:HP_0000337","obo:HP_0001397","obo:HP_0008897","obo:HP_0003100","obo:HP_0000348","obo:HP_0001511","obo:HP_0000325","obo:HP_0031295","obo:HP_0000268"],"previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c0b9bd18-eb3c-4922-9576-133a3afc9f2c_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27256967","allele":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/09c6d1bd-9d04-4e8c-8022-2d05b7607296","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NC_000017.10:g.57075470_57235248del159779","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/599190"}},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a3be867f-4e42-42fc-8bd5-2d6222b50868","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NR_148347.2(TRIM37):n.2266-12A>G (undefined)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA773551184"}}]}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0faa569d-4e0c-4809-a1b2-a93d460751e8_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0faa569d-4e0c-4809-a1b2-a93d460751e8_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d5d73ff3-79ec-4782-aa96-2de5ee44ccf9","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The evidence is scored reduced points for partial recapitulation of the human phenotype.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e07c58c6-c153-4953-9622-92aadba9daad","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Trim37-/- pups were viable with no visible abnormalities. Mice started to lose weight at 6m (males) to 12m (females). CT analysis revealed 6mo mice had smaller skull size than normal. At 12m, upto 20% weight loss, reduced mobility and behavioral changes were noted, with severity increasing with age.\n\nTrim37-/- mice were infertile due to gonadal degeneration. Males showed histological evidence of testicular degeneration by postnatal day 13. In females, germ cell aplasia and hilus cell hyperplasia were noted in the ovaries, with some 6mo mice showing ovarian lipid cell hyperplasia. Ovarian cysts and Sertoli cell tumors were also seen.\n\nNon-compaction cardiomyopathy was also observed in mice. 22-24mo lice showed enlarged relative liver size with prominent hepatomegaly. Progressive vacuolization was noted in 1-, 4-, 6- and 18-mo mice. Mice >1mo showed neutral lipid accumulation in the liver. FBS was elevated in adult 6mo mice compared to wild-type. No difference was observed between Trim37-/- and control mice in serum triacylglycerol, cholesterol, free fatty acids, long chain fatty acids, very long chain fatty acids, branched chain fatty acid, phytanic acid, docosanoic acid, tetracosanoic acid, hexacosanoic acid or docosahexaenoic acid. Pristanic acid values were below detection levels in KO and wild-type mice. No overt peroxisome pathology (size, shape or abundance) was seen in Trim37-/- mice.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27044324","rdfs:label":"Kettunen_Mouse","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0faa569d-4e0c-4809-a1b2-a93d460751e8_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7e6f58cc-de5a-4d52-abd8-7db8699795b7","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/37dae780-cf4a-4ae4-8db4-2c2b8cfe5a3f","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"TRIM37 is shown to ubiquitylate PEX5 (at K464), and the E3 ligase activity of TRIM37 depended on its RING domain.
