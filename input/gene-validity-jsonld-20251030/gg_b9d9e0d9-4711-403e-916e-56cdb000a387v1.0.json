The NDUFAF4 gene encodes NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) assembly factor 4.\n\nThe NDUFAF4 gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Leigh syndrome spectrum in 2017 (PMID: 28853723). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included one homozygous variant identified in one case in one publication (PMID: 28853723). No segregation data were available. Loss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease association is also supported by known biochemical function, expression, functional alteration in patient cells, and rescue in patient cells (PMIDs: 18179882, 25613900, 23670274).\n\nIn summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on January 13, 2020 (SOP Version 7).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b9d9e0d9-4711-403e-916e-56cdb000a387","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2df4e73b-a8a5-4ce2-bab6-2be732d3c542","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2df4e73b-a8a5-4ce2-bab6-2be732d3c542_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2020-02-12T19:47:34.160Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2df4e73b-a8a5-4ce2-bab6-2be732d3c542_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2df4e73b-a8a5-4ce2-bab6-2be732d3c542_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3274f462-602b-418a-a9b2-7fb87ffbfc9a_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"CI enzymatic activity and CI levels was rescued by complementation with wt-NDUFAF4 but not by mock transfection with V5-tagged GFP.
