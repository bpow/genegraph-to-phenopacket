At least two unique missense variants were reported in three probands with atrioventricular septal defects (PMID: 19506109). This gene-disease relationship is also supported by expression data in mouse embryos and two zebrafish models (PMID: 11533493, 22815472, 22815472). In summary, the evidence supporting the relationship between *UGDH* and autosomal dominant congenital heart disease has been disputed and no valid evidence remains to support the claim. More evidence is needed to either support or entirely refute the role *UGDH* plays in this disease. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Congenital Heart Disease GCEP on the meeting date June 10th, 2024 (SOP Version 10).\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/29890dfa-6e69-46fa-9217-a4258b24e8b0","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ecce1706-83f5-4a2e-8f15-3a2207972a69","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ecce1706-83f5-4a2e-8f15-3a2207972a69_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10130","date":"2024-08-21T12:32:02.353Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ecce1706-83f5-4a2e-8f15-3a2207972a69_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10130","date":"2024-06-10T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"No convincing variants were observed in human patients.","curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ecce1706-83f5-4a2e-8f15-3a2207972a69_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ecce1706-83f5-4a2e-8f15-3a2207972a69_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/07df1ec5-ce9f-4c6e-b51c-b1207d4c0941","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Downgraded as this model is a MO zebrafish model which also is not consistent with the mode of inheritance of disease in human ","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/de63d260-e2a0-4e63-86f6-384f07c975b7","type":"Finding","dc:description":"The AV border cells do not differentiate from their neighbors in jekyll mutants, suggesting that jekyll is required in a cell signaling event that establishes a boundary between the atrium and the ventricle.
