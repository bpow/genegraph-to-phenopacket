Three variants (nonsense and splice donor) that have been reported in 3 probands in 3 publications are included in this curation (PMIDs: 25365219, 32008135, 34868072). The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss of function. Individuals affected with combined immunodeficiency due to BCL10 deficiency present in infancy with severe, recurrent infections. While more evidence is needed to establish the full phenotype, patients reported to date have normal total T cell counts but a deficit of memory T cells combined with impaired effector T cell functions, hypogammaglobulinemia, and decreased memory B cells. Low counts of other T cell subsets and NK cells have been described. Heterozygous carriers are reported as unaffected (PMID: 25365219, 34868072). \n\nThis gene-disease association is supported by biochemical studies, protein interactions, functional and rescue assays, as well as animal models (PMIDs: 10400625, 24074955, 25365219, 32008135, 11163238, 12910267). BCL10 is a part of the CARD11/9–BCL10–MALT1 (CBM) complex. It acts as a signaling molecule transducing the triggering of cell surface antigen receptors to NF-kappaB activation (PMID: 10400625, 24074955). We have previously established other genes within this complex including CARD11 as definitively associated with severe combined immune deficiency. Affected patient cells show altered NF-kappaB signaling that is rescued by wild type (PMID: 25365219, 32008135). BCL10 knockout mice have B cell lymphopenia, reduced B cell proliferation, hypogammaglobulinemia, and impaired immune responses consistent with combined immunodeficiency (PMID: 11163238, 12910267).\n\nIn summary, BCL10 is definitively associated with combined immunodeficiency due to BCL10 deficiency. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen SCID/CID GCEP on the meeting date December 15, 2022 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0c64d294-3591-43cf-b56f-d18305c8c8ed","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2826b3a9-d32b-4d91-8c5d-1a20c408d08d","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2826b3a9-d32b-4d91-8c5d-1a20c408d08d_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10081","date":"2022-12-29T18:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2826b3a9-d32b-4d91-8c5d-1a20c408d08d_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10081","date":"2023-01-25T18:35:57.879Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2826b3a9-d32b-4d91-8c5d-1a20c408d08d_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/102d5a96-f7e0-45d1-8950-3348ed5fc119_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/83b2c777-aae4-4097-bacd-fbe66a7f64d9","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"This variant has 1 allele in gnomAD and is expected to undergo NMD.
