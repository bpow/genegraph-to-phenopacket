Hypomorphic mutations in the SLC39A7 gene, encoding ZIP7, cause a human immunodeficiency syndrome characterized by an absence of circulating B cells, agammaglobulinemia and early-onset infections. Seven missense variants have been reported in five probands, and one additional family member, in one publication (PMID: 30718914). This gene-disease association is supported by its function as a zinc transporter (PMID: 14525538) that contributes to proper signal transduction through the (pre-)BCR for the transition from pre-B cell to immature B cell. Functional alteration is found in patient cells in which constitutive phosphatase activity was indeed higher (PMID: 30718914).  Additionally, there is a knock-in mouse model that recapitulates disease (PMID: 30718914). In summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ad532ecd-4ae8-43ec-9965-87589e2c6560","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/69ebdc60-2bdd-4020-9d20-7c0ea0fd3cdd","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/69ebdc60-2bdd-4020-9d20-7c0ea0fd3cdd_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10080","date":"2021-09-21T13:06:47.864Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/69ebdc60-2bdd-4020-9d20-7c0ea0fd3cdd_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10080","date":"2021-09-21T13:06:38.465Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/69ebdc60-2bdd-4020-9d20-7c0ea0fd3cdd_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/69ebdc60-2bdd-4020-9d20-7c0ea0fd3cdd_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/46cd2f53-ef1d-4f4e-91f6-d6adb223a4e5","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"As in patients, there was a selective and profound failure of B cell development in ZIP7-mutated mice with both the patient identified P190A (P198A in mice) variant and H199QV.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b0e16327-6140-42e7-b31a-819b810b55e7","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Mice with homozygous (ZIP7P198A/P198A or ZIP7H199QV/H199QV) or compound heterozygous (ZIP7P198A/H199QV) hypomorphic mutations demonstrated profound B cell immunodeficiency.
