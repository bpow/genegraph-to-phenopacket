At least ten variants (e.g. missense, in-frame indel, etc) have been reported in\nhumans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data,\nexperimental data. \nVariants in this gene have been reported in at least 17 probands in three publications (PMID: 17932957, 16227997, 26273216). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 24 additional family members. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence and experimental evidence has been reached. The mechanism for disease is heterozygous gain of function, with CNM DNM2 mutations interrupting the normal regulatory pathway and causing overexpression of DNM2 in the skeletal muscle resulting in myopathy phenotypes. Of note, this gene has also been implicated in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, dominant intermediate B and Lethal congenital contracture syndrome 5. These will be assessed separately.\nThis gene-disease association is also supported by shared biochemical function with BIN1, another gene responsible for centronuclear myopathy apparently via DNM2 dysregulation as shown by mouse models. Skin fibroblasts in DNM2 patients also demonstrate modified endocytosis, another factor which can influence the progress of various myopathies. A mouse model displaying the most common CNM variant, R465W, clearly recapitulates the phenotypes observed in human probands. Lastly, expression of siRNAs to block expression of the variant in these same mice fully rescues the disease phenotype.\nIn summary, DNM2 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant centronuclear myopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9b4a8296-5b7e-4a55-a906-d64f059f3914","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e4156721-f6b9-482c-b610-97753f3f722d","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e4156721-f6b9-482c-b610-97753f3f722d_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10031","date":"2019-12-20T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e4156721-f6b9-482c-b610-97753f3f722d_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10031","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e4156721-f6b9-482c-b610-97753f3f722d_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e4156721-f6b9-482c-b610-97753f3f722d_ad_dn_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0fb5895e-ed84-4070-9311-264c5e81140f_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Sufficent phenotypic evidence combined with confirmed de novo inheritance gives this proband a default 2.0 points.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4eed6315-32d7-47ef-85ca-cdc87fba916b","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17932957","rdfs:label":"1","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Days","detectionMethod":"Exons and exon-intron boundaries of DNM2 were PCR-amplified and unidirectionally sequenced with both direction confirmation.","phenotypeFreeText":"No evidence of necrosis or regeneration in biopsies, Mild apex dilation","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0011470","obo:HP_0003803","obo:HP_0003687","obo:HP_0000508","obo:HP_0003324","obo:HP_0001319","obo:HP_0001761","obo:HP_0000218","obo:HP_0002650","obo:HP_0011807","obo:HP_0000194","obo:HP_0100297","obo:HP_0001270","obo:HP_0001771","obo:HP_0002033","obo:HP_0000597"],"previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"Creatine kinase level at 92 uL/L, White blood cells at 6700/mm^3, Neutrophil counts at 54% at 5 yrs 9 months","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0fb5895e-ed84-4070-9311-264c5e81140f_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17932957","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/37b6e200-1c95-4273-bd66-a8cd55163ca9","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001005360.2(DNM2):c.1852G>A (p.Ala618Thr)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA404041079"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:DeNovoAlleleOrigin"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADDeNovoCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a2fbbc72-e4d8-4ca3-a894-e6cb7dddbdc4_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Ample phenotypic evidence combined with confirmed de novo inheritance gives this proband a default 2.0 points.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5d314b93-e6ef-48b9-b7ab-699be6c1a0c8","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26273216","rdfs:label":"2","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Days","detectionMethod":"Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood.

The RW-DNM2 mice display the classic symptoms of increased internal and centralized nuclei, muscle atrophy, abnormal staining, and the resulting muscle weakness due to reduced specific maximal force. Although a few symptoms were not present, this is easily explained due to the method of injection into already developed mouse muscle. WT-DNM2 mice showed similar phenotypes, implying that the dysregulation of DNM2 expression leads to an increase of GTPase activity and the resulting disorder. Defects in sarcomere maintaince and T-tubule organization were also found in the RW-DNM2 model, supporting these structural defects as the pathological mechanism of the disease.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21514436","rdfs:label":"DNM2 Mutant Expression Recapitulates Myopathy","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":3},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b1d2dc8a-b9ef-448e-9fb6-3599bdf4e1e3","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"This siRNA treatment which blocks the action of the pathogenic gain-of-function variant clearly rescues the phenotypes that result from the mutant including the muscle weakness, atrophy, contractile strength, and the histopathological abnormalities displayed in both humans and this mouse model.

Interference in the function of BIN1, such as with cholesterol depletion or expression suppression by siRNA, significantly inhibited myoblast fusion and differentiation and halted the biogenesis of the triad structure.\n\nSeveral publications have also shown that BIN1 and DNM2 have a positive genetic interaction with each other (PMIDs: 12183633, 17676042, 29130937). Normally BIN1 acts as a negative regulator for DNM2 expression which prevents overexpression of the wildtype, however when mutant BIN1 loses the capability to properly function significantly increased DNM2 is observed in conjunction with the centronuclear myopathy phenotypes. Mouse models have further demonstrated that normally homozygous lethal BIN1 -/- knockout mice become viable with normal muscle force and muscle fiber organization when  the DNM2 gene undergoes a heterozygous knockout for a +/- in the same line of mice. This reveals that BIN1 and DNM2 both function through a common pathway and define both these genes as important regulators of muscle/triad development and organization.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31691805","rdfs:label":"DNM2 and BIN1 are Implicated in CNM","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionA"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":6}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":598,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria6","strengthScore":18,"subject":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/eeKK1UqmF7A","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0008048","gene":"hgnc:2974","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"1.0","websiteLegacyID":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/assertion_e4156721-f6b9-482c-b610-97753f3f722d-","@context":{"@vocab":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"},"curationReasons":{"@type":"@vocab","@container":"@set"},"GCISnapshot":{"@type":"@id"},"dc:isVersionOf":{"@type":"@id"},"websiteLegacyID":{"@type":"@id"}}}
