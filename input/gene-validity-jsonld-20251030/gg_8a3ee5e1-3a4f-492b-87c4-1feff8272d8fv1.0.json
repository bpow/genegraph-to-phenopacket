The phenotypes were consistent with other forms of Bardet-Biedl syndrome, including obesity, pigmentary retinopathy, polydactyly, hypogonadism, kidney and heart abnormalities, and/or intellectual impairment. *TRIM32* variants have separately been asserted in relation to autosomal recessive limb-girdle muscular dystrophy as early as 2002 (Frosk et al., PMID: 11822024). Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping & Splitting Working Group, the cases diagnosed as Bardet-Biedl syndrome were found to be distinguishable from the limb-girdle muscular dystrophy cases based on phenotype and disease mechanism, despite their matching mode of inheritance (autosomal recessive). Therefore, a split curation was recommended for Bardet-Biedl syndrome 11 ()MIM# 615988), while *TRIM32* has already been separately curated for autosomal recessive limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (MIM# 254110, MONDO:0015152).\n\nThis curation includes one missense variant identified in the homozygous state in four affected patients from one consanguineous Israeli Bedouin family in one publication (PMID: 16606853). Interestingly, the variant is located in the B-box-2 domain, in which variants have not yet been observed to be involved in the pathogenesis of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (PMID: 16606853,  PMID: 38304327).\n\nThe experimental evidence supporting the relationship of *TRIM32* to Bardet-Biedl syndrome includes data from expression studies and animal models. *TRIM32* is also known as *BBS11* and encodes tripartite motif-containing protein 32, an E3 ubiquitin ligase that is responsible for protein degradation (PMID: 19349376) and known to regulate autophagy (PMID: 33802079). *TRIM32* is expressed in a pattern that matches other BBS-related genes (PMID: 11822024). Knockdown of the *trim32* ortholog in zebrafish results in a phenotype consistent with BBS (PMID: 16606853).\n\nIn summary, *TRIM32* has limited evidence of association with autosomal recessive Bardet-Biedl syndrome 11 (MIM#615988, MONDO:0014439). Additional case evidence will be requried for this gene-disease association to reach a mroe definitive classification. This clinical validity classification was approved by the ClinGen Retina Gene Curation Expert Panel on July 11th, 2024 (SOP version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8a3ee5e1-3a4f-492b-87c4-1feff8272d8f","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4140e7c5-ac53-4748-b20f-07d3877ea0d6","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4140e7c5-ac53-4748-b20f-07d3877ea0d6_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10072","date":"2024-07-11T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4140e7c5-ac53-4748-b20f-07d3877ea0d6_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10072","date":"2025-01-04T22:02:17.703Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4140e7c5-ac53-4748-b20f-07d3877ea0d6_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4140e7c5-ac53-4748-b20f-07d3877ea0d6_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6af50393-3e83-43c8-a777-142da0d812bf","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/53f62a51-10b6-4f81-9280-2c1325bdb469","type":"Finding","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16606853","rdfs:label":"TRIM32 mRNA rescue","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:PhenotypeRescue"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanRescueCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4140e7c5-ac53-4748-b20f-07d3877ea0d6_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/43098dce-f86c-43ed-a18d-a2da7b06fb94","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6bc0003d-58dc-4011-a788-6bb3623cbb2e","type":"Finding","dc:description":"TRIM32 Expression Is Strongly Correlated with Expression of Other BBS Genes.
