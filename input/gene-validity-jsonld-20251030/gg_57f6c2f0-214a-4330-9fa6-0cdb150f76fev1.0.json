{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/57f6c2f0-214a-4330-9fa6-0cdb150f76fev1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"Variants in *DNAH12* were first described as causal for spermatogenic failure in 2021 (Oud et al. 2021, PMID: 34089056). These cases represent one of at least one hundred different forms of spermatogenic failure distinguished by a single monogenic cause. Some of the most commonly reported patient phenotypes are male infertility, short sperm flagella, reduced sperm motility, abnormal sperm head and tail morphology, absent, coiled or bent sperm flagella, and absent sperm axoneme central pair complex. As a member of the *DNAH* gene family of axonemal dynein arm components, *DNAH12* has also been viewed as a candidate gene for primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). Currently, there is no published case level genetic evidence or experimental data to support a gene/disease relationship between *DNAH12* and PCD. Per the recommendations of the ClinGen Lumping & Splitting Working Group, *DNAH12* was recommended for splitting, in order to focus the present curation specifically on the relationship between *DNAH12* and spermatogenic failure.\n\nThis curation includes 15 variants (3 nonsense, 9 missense, and 3 disrupting splicing) that have been collectively reported in 11 male probands in 4 publications (PMID: 40146200, PMID: 39071892, PMID: 34089056, PMID: 34791246). Overall, the mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be biallelic loss-of-function. \n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence showing that *DNAH12* is primarily expressed in the lung, fallopian tube, and testis (PMID: 23715323, PMID: 40146200, PMID: 39071892). A mouse model with a 4-bp deletion in exon 5 recapitulates the abnormal sperm morphology, abnormal sperm motility, male infertility and absent sperm axoneme central pair complex seen in the human probands, as well as no obvious symptoms of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PMID: 40146200). A second mouse model producing a truncated DNAH12 protein showed abnormal sperm morphology and abnormal sperm motility ((PMID: 40146200)). Finally, a mouse model with a targeted excision of exons 3 to exon 5 of *Dnah12* recapitulated the male infertility, abnormal sperm motility, abnormal sperm head morphology and coiled sperm flagella seen in human probands (PMID: 39071892).\n\nIn conclusion, *DNAH12* has a Definitive association with spermatogenic failure. This classification has been clearly demonstrated and confirmed in both clinical and research settings and has been upheld over time without the emergence of conflicting evidence. This classification was approved by the Motile Ciliopathy GCEP on May 8th, 2025 (SOP Version 11).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/57f6c2f0-214a-4330-9fa6-0cdb150f76fe","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2911f00b-c01b-40fb-a82e-38e004eda251","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2911f00b-c01b-40fb-a82e-38e004eda251_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10102","date":"2025-09-25T20:40:06.126Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2911f00b-c01b-40fb-a82e-38e004eda251_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10102","date":"2025-05-08T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2911f00b-c01b-40fb-a82e-38e004eda251_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2911f00b-c01b-40fb-a82e-38e004eda251_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5b9d4090-f14a-4e3d-986f-c5f12ffaad6c","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ca6347b4-ae6a-482c-b17a-0aec53231d70","type":"Finding","dc:description":"The mouse model recapitulates the male infertility, abnormal sperm motility, abnormal sperm head morphology and coiled sperm flagella seen in human probands.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39071892","rdfs:label":"Geng et al. 2024","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3a5bd543-8ee9-4d15-a831-3b744f071a32","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Slightly downscored because all the phenotypes weren't an exact match","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1fc19d27-4570-46c1-8b76-32fe1252aca4","type":"Finding","dc:description":"The abnormal sperm morphology, abnormal sperm motility, abnormal sperm morphology recapitulates the phenotypes seems in the human probands and the abnormal sperm axoneme morphology seen in the mouse model is similar to the absent sperm axoneme central pair complex found in the human proband.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40146200","rdfs:label":"Yang et al. 2025","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8cb234e7-2cc5-46a7-a08f-1d903423c2ff","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cc567acc-8d24-47d7-9c94-20ebe64f45c4","type":"Finding","dc:description":"The mouse model recapitulates the abnormal sperm morphology, abnormal sperm motility, male infertility and absent sperm axoneme central pair complex seen in the human probands.

It remains unclear whether variants in DNAH12 cause DFS-MMAF in this patient.\n\nPatient ARG1 carried two missense variants (p.(Phe1298Ser) and p.(Pro2480Ser)) in DNAH12, which is the closest paralog of the DNAH1 gene. Pathogenic variants in DNAH1 are known to cause classical PCD or DFS-MMAF without any PCD symptoms (Ben Khelifa et al., 2014; Wambergue et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2017; Amiri-Yekta et al., 2016; Sha et al., 2017; Coutton et al., 2018; Sha et al., 2019b; Coutton et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019b; Hu et al., 2019).

And importantly, the RT-PCR experiment also confirmed a significant decrease expression of DNAH12 mRNA. Therefore, based on these evidences, we proposed that biallelic deleterious variants of DNAH12 could be responsible for male infertility in humans, potentially associated with asthenoteratospermia characterized by MMAF.","phenotypes":"obo:HP_0003251","sex":"Male","variant":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/dfb2ba1d-f1a0-4c44-a959-b5ffbfc02b61_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fc63ef05-70df-4691-87b1-43d5add96256_variant_evidence_item"}]}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria","strengthScore":3.0},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ac59c8e7-61fc-40cd-8be9-cd0d0d0a3b07_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0625454b-2db5-4bd8-a520-3379b3b5b7a8","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Upscored for variant recurrence, Downscored for homozygosity, Downscored for consanguinity","calculatedScore":3.0,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0625454b-2db5-4bd8-a520-3379b3b5b7a8_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39071892","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8b4692b5-3208-4498-91d6-e16e672ddfaf"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":1.0},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ac59c8e7-61fc-40cd-8be9-cd0d0d0a3b07","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39071892","rdfs:label":"NJ0278","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":41,"allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8b4692b5-3208-4498-91d6-e16e672ddfaf"},"detectionMethod":"WES.

The results showed that DNAH12 signals were localized along the flagella of the fertile control, however, no DNAH12 signals were observed in sperm flagella of patients P3 (family 1), P5 (family 2), P8 (family 3), P9, P10, and P11 (Figure 2D). Collectively, these findings indicated that all the detected DNAH12 variants cause the absence of DNAH12 protein in the sperm of our patients, reinforcing that these DNAH12 mutations are pathogenic mutations of asthenoteratozoospermia in the patients.\n\nTEM micrographs on P3's sperm.
