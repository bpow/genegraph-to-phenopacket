R274Q, A267V, T385M, and R274W are hotspot mutations identified in nearly 40% of all patients with STAT1-GOF (PMIDs: 27114460, 32852681 and  33777053). *STAT1* GOF mutations underlie AD Chronic Mucocutaneous Candidiasis (CMC), as well as a wide range of other clinical features, including  a variety of infectious and autoimmune diseases, cerebral aneurysms and cancers (PMID: 27114460). Thyroid dysfunction and autoimmune diabetes are among the most frequent autoimmune manifestations reported, at 22% and 4% respectively. 10 missense variants are included in this curation to reach the maximum score for genetic evidence (PMIDs: 21727188, 23541320, 23534974, 22730530, 28139313). Counting disease segregation in 2 families provided a LOD score of 3 and added 1 point to the genetic evidence (PMID: 21727188). More case-level evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts) has been reached.\n\nThe reported *STAT1*-GOF mutations are demonstrated to result in gain of STAT1 phosphorylation and gain of function for GAF-dependent cellular responses (PMID: 21727188). Also, Impaired development and function of IL-17 and IL-22- producing T cells ex vivo are detected in patients with AD CMCD having *STAT1* GOF mutations. IFN-γ induced prolonged STAT1 phosphorylation in gain of function mutants and significant diminution of IL-17+FOXP3−CD4+ cells (Th17) were also shown in patients with autoimmune manifestations. Consistent with the phenotype of patients with GOF-*STAT1* mutations, GOF-*Stat1* mice had increased STAT1 protein levels,  enhanced pSTAT1 upon IFN-γ stimulation and defective IL-17 production after C. albicans inoculation (PMID: 31867619). In a specific pathogen-free model, *Stat1*T385M/+ mice developed sex-biased autoimmunity and exhibited pronounced dysregulation of basal and cytokine-stimulated *Stat1* activation (PMID: 37275873).\n\nJanus kinase inhibitor therapy ruxolitinib was shown to decrease STAT1 phosphorylation in response to stimulation with IFN-β and IFN-γ, reverse dysregulated T helper cell responses and lead to resolution of the chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis and autoimmunity caused by *STAT1*- gain of function mutations (PMID: 28139313). In a multicenter retrospective study (Fischer  et al., 2024 PMID: 37935260), JAK inhibitor treatment resulted in partial or complete remission of clinical symptoms in most investigated patients with STAT1-GOF.\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *STAT1* and autoimmune enteropathy and endocrinopathy - susceptibility to chronic infections syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld overtime.\n\n**Diabetes Addendum (approved by Monogenic Diabetes GCEP 10/23/2024):**\n\nAutosomal dominant *STAT1* GOF variants were first implicated in diabetes in 2013. Three patients with polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy, dermatitis, recurrent mucosal and fungal infections, and autoimmune diabetes were found to have *STAT1* GOF variants. The patients were diagnosed with autoimmune diabetes (two GAD+) between 11 months (presenting with ketoacidosis) and 5 years of age (PMID: 23534974).  A subsequent international case series of 274 patients from 167 kindreds with *STAT1* variants revealed 11 (4%) patients with autoimmune diabetes.  Within this *STAT1* cohort, aneurysms were more common (27% vs. 5%) in patients with autoimmune diabetes (PMID: 27114460).  While diabetes has only been seen in a minority of patients, the prevalence is increased over the general population and cases reported have a young age of onset. Therefore, *STAT1* is appropriate to be included on clinical panels for neonatal diabetes.  Individuals found to have a *STAT1* variant causative of diabetes should be monitored for other autoimmune enteropathy and endocrinopathy and susceptibility to chronic infections, and those with non-diabetes presentations should undergo glycemic screening.\n\n\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c72ad313-c3a9-45d0-8e93-b2311caef599","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e3df6d1b-5611-4814-b283-8a082b725bc0","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10016","role":"SecondaryContributor"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e3df6d1b-5611-4814-b283-8a082b725bc0_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10145","date":"2024-12-17T10:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e3df6d1b-5611-4814-b283-8a082b725bc0_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10145","date":"2024-12-25T09:38:24.700Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e3df6d1b-5611-4814-b283-8a082b725bc0_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9617cf31-fb2c-4424-9170-a9779f009528","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Multiple experiments demonstrated functional alteration of the mutant cells (Delayed STAT1 dephosphorylation, enhanced DNA binding, and transactivation).
