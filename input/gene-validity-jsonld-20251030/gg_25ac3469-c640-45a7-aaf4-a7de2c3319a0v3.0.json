Some of the phenotypes associated with ABCD3 congenital bile acid synthesis defect or include hepatomegaly, jaundice and increased plasma bile acid intermediates and VLCFAs.\n\n*ABCD3* was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive  congenital bile acid synthesis defect in 2015. (Ferdinandusse et al, PMID: 25168382). This is the only report of a genetic defect in *ABCD3* identified in a human patient. Earlier, *ABCD3* was associated with peroxisome biogenesis as mutations were identified in the *ABCD3* gene in patients with Zellweger syndrome. However, it was later shown that a *PEX1* defect was the underlying cause of peroxisome biogenesis disorder in those patients (PMID: 25168382). \n   \nSummary of Case Level Data (1 point):\nA homozygous deletion variant has been reported in 1 proband in 1 publication (PMID: 25168382), wherein a truncated protein product is shown to be made. The mechanism for disease is expected to be homozygous loss of function.  \n  \nSummary of experimental data (4 points):\nThis gene-disease association is supported by a mouse models that recapitulate some of the human disease phenotype (PMIDs 25168382, 34564857) and protein interactions with *ABCD1* (PMID: 10551832) and PEX19 (PMID: 16344115). \n  \nIn summary, there is limited evidence to support the gene-disease relationship of *ABCD3* and congenital bile acid synthesis defect 5. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged.\n\nThis gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the Peroxisomal GCEP on April 27, 2022. It was reevaluated on June 6, 2025 (SOP v 10). No new evidence was added and the classification did not change.
