At least 43 unique variants (including many missense and nonsense, as well as some in-frame indel, frameshift, large deletion, complex rearrangement, etc) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data.\nVariants in the gene have been reported in at least 11 probands in 5 publications (PMIDS: 23859858, 1463019, 1598908, 2365823, 29443755). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached.\nThe mechanism for disease is homozygous loss of function.\nThis gene-disease relationship is supported by the biochemical function of ARG1, catalyzing the final step of the urea cycle (PMID: 16747805), and two knockout mouse models which share the biochemical manifestations of hyperammonemia and hyperargininemia while lacking the clinical phenotypes of humans (PMIDs: 12052859, 23920045).\nIn summary, ARG1 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive inheritance of hyperargininemia. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bd65ccf4-37c3-44e2-808b-d2fa7ed5c3ba","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0157f793-9232-4700-bbf0-dfb16270f688","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":[{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"},{"id":"cg:sopChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0157f793-9232-4700-bbf0-dfb16270f688_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10011","date":"2020-06-29T17:41:01.533Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0157f793-9232-4700-bbf0-dfb16270f688_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10011","date":"2020-09-16T19:23:17.635Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0157f793-9232-4700-bbf0-dfb16270f688_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0157f793-9232-4700-bbf0-dfb16270f688_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8074d2d6-c3b4-4872-9a70-97dd81e34a89","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Catalysis of the reaction: L-arginine + H2O = L-ornithine + urea is evidenced by the conversion of arginine to urea in a concentration dependent manner and the inhibitory effects of L-ornithine on this conversion. \n\nAs reviewed in PMID: 26467175, mutations throughout the ARG1 gene, resulting in partial or complete loss of enzyme function, causes ARG1-deficient patients to exhibit hyperargininemia.
