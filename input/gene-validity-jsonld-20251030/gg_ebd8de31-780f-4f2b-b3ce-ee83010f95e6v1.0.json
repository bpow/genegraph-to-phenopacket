This association was made using case-level data and experimental data. At least 7 missense variants have been reported in humans. TMC1 was first associated with this disease in humans as early as 2002 (Kimura et al.). Association is seen in at least 9 probands in 8 publications (26079994, 19180119, 17250663, 11850618, 26346818, 20447146, 24827932, 25560804). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in >50 additional family members. The mechanism for disease is hypothesized to be that TMC1 and TMC2 are required for mechanoelectrical transmission in cochlear and vestibular hair cells. This gene-disease association is supported by animal models, functional alteration of mechanoelectrical transduction in mouse OHC's, expression studies as well as a rescue in a mouse model. In summary, TMC1 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant nonsyndromic hearing loss. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hearing Loss Working Group on 6/22/2018.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ebd8de31-780f-4f2b-b3ce-ee83010f95e6","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/966d2fa1-5245-420d-9bf0-4a36aab29d74","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/966d2fa1-5245-420d-9bf0-4a36aab29d74_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/966d2fa1-5245-420d-9bf0-4a36aab29d74_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2018-06-22T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/966d2fa1-5245-420d-9bf0-4a36aab29d74_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/966d2fa1-5245-420d-9bf0-4a36aab29d74_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9a375e16-8f2e-4204-8a8d-2eb0ab9ace0d","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/405f7919-ae18-40ef-a4da-56e7d3ce797b","type":"Finding","dc:description":"The TMC1 dominant hearing loss in humans has been identified to be progressive.
