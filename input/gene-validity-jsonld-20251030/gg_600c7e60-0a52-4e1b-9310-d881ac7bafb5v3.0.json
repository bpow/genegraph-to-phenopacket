There were two additional cases of genetic evidence referenced in the curation, but these were not scored due to high allele frequency/evidence for benign impact of the variants (PMIDs: 39414394, 39467953). The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss-of-function. This gene-disease association is also supported by experimental evidence (ie. rat/mouse models, expression-level evidence, biochemical functional evidence, interaction evidence; PMIDs: 21633011, 21047793, 28931751). Expression-level data from GTEx and Humphrey's lab shows expression in the kidney, especially the distal convoluted tubule. Rat/mouse model evidence indicates that mutants have hypotension; excessive urination with hypokalemic metabolic acidosis; and abnormally high levels of potassium, calcium, and magnesium in urine. Biochemical functional evidence shows that the protein forms a heterodimer channel with KCNJ10 to allow potassium into the cell, which helps maintain electrolyte homeostasis. KCNJ10 is definitive for autosomal EAST Syndrome (Epilepsy, Ataxia, Sensorineural Deafness, and Renal Tubulopathy). This is relevant since EAST Syndrome includes salt-wasting renal tubulopathy. There was also an kidney organoid model found (PMID: 39183338), but this was not scored since it is not as informative as a in vivo model. \n\nThis gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the Tubulopathy GCEP on December 7, 2022. It was reevaluated on October 1, 2025 (SOP Version 11). As a result of this reevaluation, the classification increased from strong to definitive with the addition of genetic evidence (PMID: 37466410) that fulfilled the replication over time requirement.

She also had increased serum random aldosterone (1484 pg/mL, reference range: 30-160 pg/mL) and renin activity (4.96 ng/mL.h, reference range 0.15-2.33 ng/mL.h).   ","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0002181","obo:HP_0001959","obo:HP_0001695","obo:HP_0030149","obo:HP_0002013","obo:HP_0001960","obo:HP_0001945","obo:HP_0002148","obo:HP_0000127","obo:HP_0000961","obo:HP_0000847","obo:HP_0011675","obo:HP_0000103","obo:HP_0002901"],"sex":"Female","variant":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e06bba3c-18b6-45bc-982f-f80931ca5082_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37466410","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/32ad0ae5-e8cc-4fda-bb6c-4c2a78879ae8"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"}},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bcda0480-0231-4780-bbf1-a51cec08faa5_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37466410","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/738c56c1-7807-4d0c-b408-74e407e9770b"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"}}]},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e06bba3c-18b6-45bc-982f-f80931ca5082","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e06bba3c-18b6-45bc-982f-f80931ca5082_variant_evidence_item"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":0.1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bcda0480-0231-4780-bbf1-a51cec08faa5","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bcda0480-0231-4780-bbf1-a51cec08faa5_variant_evidence_item"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":0.1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria","strengthScore":0.2},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8f64dbf4-3b33-4084-938e-321ebd5099a7_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8f64dbf4-3b33-4084-938e-321ebd5099a7","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33811157","rdfs:label":"Female: compound heterozygous for p.I132R and p.P250L","ageType":"AgeAtDiagnosis","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":26,"allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/050ffd99-e298-4a22-af59-766d48e1d270","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_170741.4(KCNJ16):c.749C>T (p.Pro250Leu)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA8738567"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"Hypokalemic tubulopathy and deafness; had acidosis, kidney salt wasting, abnormally high levels of renin and aldosterone, and sensorineural deafness\n","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001941","obo:HP_0000407","obo:HP_0000127"],"sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/17e51dbe-24f3-49cf-8e33-982bca555bde_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33811157","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/050ffd99-e298-4a22-af59-766d48e1d270"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"}}},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/17e51dbe-24f3-49cf-8e33-982bca555bde","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/17e51dbe-24f3-49cf-8e33-982bca555bde_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/17e51dbe-24f3-49cf-8e33-982bca555bde_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"Mutant cells had decreased channel activity and surface expression in comparison to the wildtype.
