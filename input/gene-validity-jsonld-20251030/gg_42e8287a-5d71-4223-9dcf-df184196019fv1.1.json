Over 15 individuals with a recurrent *de novo* missense variant, c.892C>T, p.Arg298Trp, have been reported (PMIDs: 27479843, 28132692, 30842647, 31231135, 33057194, 34869110, 35719373, 37667351). They presented with severe to profound developmental delay or intellectual disability, epilepsy, feeding difficulties, and periodic extreme irritability and inconsolability (PMID: 37667351). Other frequent features include hypotonia, microcephaly, bilateral cataracts, brain MRI abnormalities, and sleep disorder. Only 12 probands are included in this curation because the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity of this variant is reported to be dominant negative (PMID: 37533751). Other *NACC1* missense (PMIDs: 31618753, 31785789, 33057194, 35982159, 36028527) or splice (PMID: 31981491) variants have also been reported in individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders, however, they were not scored in the current curation due to a lack of evidence supporting variant pathogenicity.\n \nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by the biochemical function of NACC1 as a transcriptional repressor (PMID: 16033423), protein interactions with key synaptic proteins involved in neurodevelopmental disorders (PMID: 37533751), and in vitro studies in mouse neurons expressing the murine homolog of the human mutant showing that the p.Arg298Trp variant impairs glutamatergic neurotransmission (PMID: 37533751).\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between the *NACC1* recurrent variant p.Arg298Trp and *NACC1*-related neurodevelopmental disorder with epilepsy, cataracts, and episodic irritability. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel on October 4, 2023 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/42e8287a-5d71-4223-9dcf-df184196019f","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bd05706d-fd13-4f5e-9063-f49d7bbefd97","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bd05706d-fd13-4f5e-9063-f49d7bbefd97_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2024-03-13T21:05:09.355Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bd05706d-fd13-4f5e-9063-f49d7bbefd97_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2023-10-04T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bd05706d-fd13-4f5e-9063-f49d7bbefd97_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/53e3cdce-090d-4040-affb-2a25d5f8e2fe","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/53e3cdce-090d-4040-affb-2a25d5f8e2fe_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31231135","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/49305e6d-2d48-4104-99f1-9c04c4ea3113","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_052876.4(NACC1):c.892C>T (p.Arg298Trp)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA16616876"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:DeNovoAlleleOrigin"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:Heterozygous"}},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/53e3cdce-090d-4040-affb-2a25d5f8e2fe_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"Examination of effects of expression of Nacc1-R284W on excitatory synaptic transmission in Nacc1+/− mouse neurons showed 1) Neurons expressing Nacc1-R284W exhibited significantly reduced glutamate-induced currents compared to neurons expressing Nacc1-WT. 2) Glutamate receptors of the kainic acid (KA) type have long been implicated in epilepsy.

Neurons expressing Nacc1-R284W exhibited significantly reduced glutamate-induced currents compared to neurons expressing Nacc1-WT. \n\nGlutamate receptors of the kainic acid (KA) type have long been implicated in epilepsy. KA elicited significantly smaller currents in Nacc1-R284W neurons than neurons expressing Nacc1-WT.\n\nAltered glutamatergic transmission is frequently observed in experimental models of epilepsy, intellectual disability and autism.
