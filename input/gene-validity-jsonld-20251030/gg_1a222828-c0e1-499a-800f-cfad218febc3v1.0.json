Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we did not find a distinct difference between the molecular mechanism, phenotypic variability, or inheritance pattern of distal myopathy/myositis and FTD/ALS 3, nor a distinct difference between the molecular mechanism or inheritance pattern of Paget disease of bone 3 and FTD/ALS 3; therefore, these diseases were lumped for the purposes of gene curation. However, we found a difference in molecular mechanism, inheritance pattern, and phenotypic variability between childhood-onset neurodegeneration with ataxia, dystonia, and gaze palsy and FTD/ALS 3, and these disease entities were split. This split curation for autosomal recessive, childhood-onset neurodegeneration with ataxia, dystonia, and gaze palsy will be curated separately.\n \nThe association between *SQSTM1* and ALS was first established in an aggregate variant case-control analysis that identified an association between non-synonymous rare variants in the gene and ALS based on the Sanger sequencing of *SQSTM1* in 1092 ALS cases and 1448 controls (Fecto et al., PMID: 22084127). This curation also includes one other case-control analysis from 1 publication that was scored (PMIDs: 24899140). Additionally, 28 variants, including missense, nonsense, and splicing variants, reported in 28 probands from 14 publications were scored in this curation. Based on the curation, a genetic evidence score of 5.6 was reached. The majority of variants identified in *SQSTM1* appear to be missense variants.\n\nThe gene-disease association is also supported by experimental evidence describing physical interaction with other known ALS associated genes (PMIDs: 30022074, 30290707, and 19765191); aberrant expression in patient cells (PMID: 14762676); functional alterations in patient and non-patient cells (PMIDs: 31362587, 28490746, 27554286, and 27158844); and establishment of model organisms and rescues (PMIDs: 33557921 and 25410659). An experimental evidence score of 5.5 was reached.\n\nAlthough the final score of 11.1 is typically rounded to the next highest whole number based on SOPv9, the ALS GCEP has chosen to apply standard rounding guidelines resulting in a score of 11 and a classification of moderate association with FTD/ALS 3. Notably, the current literature lacks evidence of variant segregation in *SQSTM1* , which is needed to gain a greater understanding of the involvement of *SQSTM1* in ALS. It is important to understand that in the clinical diagnostic setting, the identification of missense variants of uncertain significance will be common in this gene, and variant interpretation must be completed with caution. \n\nIn summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged.This classification was approved by the ClinGen ALS GCEP on the meeting date Decemeber 13, 2022 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1a222828-c0e1-499a-800f-cfad218febc3","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/dae3327f-6381-44cc-8baa-8fa1fc0d31d5","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Strong","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/dae3327f-6381-44cc-8baa-8fa1fc0d31d5_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10096","date":"2022-12-13T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/dae3327f-6381-44cc-8baa-8fa1fc0d31d5_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10096","date":"2022-12-29T22:10:17.171Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"The ALS GCEP has chosen to round the score of SQSTM1 down to 11, which results in a classification of moderate.

A significant decrease in ΔΨm was observed in p62 KD SH-SY5Y cells compared to either untransfected or cells transfected with scrambled (SCR) siRNA control. Equivalent effects on the ΔΨm were observed in the mutant fibroblasts when compared to age-matched controls. Both, p62 KD SH-SY5Y cells and p62 mutant fibroblasts showed a depolarization in response to the F0-F1-ATP synthase (ATPase or complex V) inhibitor oligomycin, suggesting ΔΨm in p62 KD cells is partially maintained by ATP hydrolysis by the ATPase.\nThe activity of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) and the rate of substrate supply can be estimated by measurement of mitochondrial NADH and FAD autofluorescence. The analysis of the FAD autofluorescence was used to generate the FAD redox index, which was higher in the p62 KD SH-SY5Y cells compared to untransfected and SCR cells. Increased NADH and FAD redox indexes in p62 deficient cells reflects inhibition of complex I-driven respiration and suggest more activated complex II dependent respiration as a compensatory mechanism. Mitochondrial NADH pool obtained was found to be reduced in the p62 KD cells and in the p62 mutant fibroblasts indicating a lack of substrates. Lower FAD pool levels were also found in the p62 KD cells confirming an inhibition in complex I and reduced substrate availability. Further analysis of complex I activity using an activity microplate assay confirmed the inhibition of complex I in the p62 mutant fibroblasts compared to controls.\nAltered mitochondrial function could be linked to an overproduction of cytosolic reactive oxygen species (ROS). The p62 KD cells and p62 mutant fibroblasts showed higher Het rates (representative of cytosolic ROS production) than controls.\nNrf2 directly regulates cellular energy metabolism by modulating the availability of substrates for mitochondrial respiration through a p62 and Nrf2 positive feed-forward regulatory loop. So they evaluated the role of Nrf2 activation on mitochondrial function in p62-deficient cells. The NADH redox index was significantly reduced in p62 mutant fibroblasts treated with Nrf2 activators compared to the same fibroblasts without treatment and the NADH pool was restored reaching equivalent values to the control fibroblasts. Results suggest that Nrf2 activation restores cellular metabolism in the p62-deficient cells by increasing the availability of substrates for mitochondrial respiration.\nDuring an oxidative insult, neurons divert part of their glucose pool towards the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), thereby increasing the production of NAD(P)H. The NAD(P)H levels in the p62 KD SH-SY5Y cells and p62 mutant fibroblasts were significantly increased compared to controls.

As a control the previously characterized PDB-linked UBA domain SQSTM1 mutation, G425R (SQSTM1G425R), also now reported in cases of ALS, was found to selectively impact only on ubiquitin-binding, with no evidence of this mutation affecting LC3B recognition.

They then confirmed the MS data using isothermal titration calorimetry, finding the LIR (L341V) peptide was associated with a ∼3-fold reduction in LC3B binding affinity (10.9 ± 1.1 μM) and a substantially reduced enthalpy of interaction. Using NMR they looked at the structural differences between WT SQSTM1 and the mutant and found 8 residues that were substantially different between the 2 complexes, with the largest effects involving V33, F52, L53, V54 and R70. Finally, in the NSC-34 cell line with the mCherry-EGFP-SQSTM1 mutant construct there were visibly fewer red acidic vesicles in the absence of the autophagy inhibitor, BafA1, than the WT.

Purified fusion MBP (maltose binding protein)-SQSTM1 mutants were incubated with K63 poly-Ub chains, followed by MBP-SQSTM1 pull down. The results showed reduced binding affinity of the SQSTM1-P394L, SQSTM1-G413S, and SQSTM1-G427R mutants to K63 poly-Ub chains compared to WT.\nNext examined the binding between SQSTM1 mutants and poly-Ub proteins in the cells using a procedure that distinguishes SQSTM1-associated poly-Ub proteins from SQSTM1 self-ubiquitination.

Consistent with previous reports using MBP pull-down assays, the G351A KIR mutant was largely unable to capture endogenous Keap1; further, we found that the P348L KIR mutant was also defective in Keap1 binding. The K344E mutation did not affect Keap1 binding of SQSTM1/p62 and likewise the more distant L341V mutant, located within the LIR, bound Keap1 normally.\nEffects of expression of L341V, K344E, P348L and G351A mutant SQSTM1/p62 on activation of basal NF-κB signaling were determined using luciferase reporter assays. All four of the ALS-FTLD mutants failed to activate NF-κB activity, relative to wild-type SQSTM1/p62, whereas the E396X positive control produced strong activation. Thus, this defective NF-κB signaling phenotype does not appear to be a feature of LIR/KIR mutants of SQSTM1/p62. \nGiven the selective effects of the two KIR mutations (P348L, G351A) on the SQSTM1/p62-Keap1 interaction, they assessed the effects of mutant protein expression on activation of Nrf2 signaling in reporter assays. Expression of wild-type SQSTM1/p62 activated Nrf2 signaling relative to empty vector. Nrf2 activity associated with expression of L341V and K344E mutants was not significantly different to wild-type SQSTM1/p62.

Contrary to SQSTM1 overexpression, siRNA knockdown of SQSTM1 caused a significant increase in insoluble MAPT.\nSimilar to that of HEK293 cells, brain lysate from rTg4510, but not from control wild-type mice, induced robust formation of insoluble mutant MAPT deposit in primary neurons from rTg4510 mice, as revealed by MC1 antibody staining.

Moreover, the c.44C>A (p.Arg15Leu) variant in CHCHD10, another ALS-linked gene coding for a mitochondrial protein, was reported to segregate in this family","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Contradicts","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2824e042-435b-44a4-ab50-06c424592742_variant_evidence_item"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":0.1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f277a45e-f06a-45f0-8d69-69e973cf746e","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Absent from GnomAD v2.1 non-neuro and v3.1 non-neuro","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f277a45e-f06a-45f0-8d69-69e973cf746e_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25708934","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/30f104d1-6a13-44b2-bfb0-bb0fb83fe527"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:AlleleOrigin"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"No","zygosity":{"id":"cg:Heterozygous"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":0.1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":5.6}],"evidenceStrength":"Moderate","sequence":5593,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria9","strengthScore":11.1,"subject":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/IDcPkhHruMI","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0014640","gene":"hgnc:11280","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"1.0","websiteLegacyID":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/assertion_dae3327f-6381-44cc-8baa-8fa1fc0d31d5-","@context":{"@vocab":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"},"curationReasons":{"@type":"@vocab","@container":"@set"},"GCISnapshot":{"@type":"@id"},"dc:isVersionOf":{"@type":"@id"},"websiteLegacyID":{"@type":"@id"}}}
