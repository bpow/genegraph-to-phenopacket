The *MTPAP* gene encodes mitochondrial poly(A) polymerase, which functions in mitochondrial transcript processing and modification. \n\nThe *MTPAP* gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive primary mitochondrial disease in 2010 (PMID: 20970105), when a a founder variant, c.1432A>G (p.Asn478Asp), was identified in the Old Order Amish population. While various names have been given to the constellation of features seen in those with *MTPAP*-related disease, including autosomal recessive spastic ataxia 4 (SPAX4) (MIM 613672) in  additional to other mitochondrial disorders, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *MTPAP* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework.  Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included seven unique variants (six missense variants and one stop-gained variant) identified in five individuals from four publications (PMIDs: 20970105, 31779033, 35235001, 27391121). The mechanism of disease appears to be loss of function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by a biochemical function (mitochondrial translation) shared with other genes associated with primary mitochondrial disease, early embryonic lethality and failure of developmental progression in a knockout mouse model, and disrupted expression of mitochondrial proteins and mitochondrial dysfunction following gene knockdown in HeLa cells (PMIDs: 33340416, 32376682, 15769737).\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between *MTPAP* and autosomal recessive primary mitochondrial disease. This relationship has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on August 1, 2022 (SOP Version 9).

Polyadenylation in both carrier parents appeared to be normal. (Fig. 2). PMID 25008111 (Wilson et al. 2014): Confirmed polyadenylation defect in skin fibroblast cell lines and further showed perturbation of de novo mitochondrial protein synthesis. In the homozygous p.N478D lines, a substantial decrease was apparent in the mitochondrially encoded proteins of the respiratory chain, ND1, a component of complex I and COX1–3, members of complex IV. NDUFB8, although nuclear encoded, was also present at decreased steady-state levels. No decreased in complex II. Analysis of the fully assembled OXPHOS complexes by blue native gels (Fig. 1C) reflected the severe decrease seen in components of complexes I and IV. Decreases in transcript polyadenylation and in respiratory chain complexes were effectively rescued by overexpression of wild-type mtPAP. Both mutated and wild-type mtPAP localized to the mitochondrial RNA-processing granules. In vitro polyadenylation assays revealed severely compromised activity by the mutated protein, which generated only short oligo(A) extensions on RNA substrates. PMID 24651433 (Martin et al. 2014): Lymphoblastoid cell lines from affected individuals in a different Amish family also homozygous for the variant showed delayed DNA repair, increased levels of DNA double-strand breaks, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), and increased cell death after irradiation.

There was cystic dilatation of the temporal horns of the lateral ventricles, and the cortex overlying the swollen white matter was stretched and smooth with frontal and perisylvian polymicrogyria.
