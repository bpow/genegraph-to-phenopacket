(Tao et al., PMID: 21276947). At the time of this curation, there were no other single-gene disorders associated with this gene. This curation is based on this disease entity only. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data. 4 variants (missense, nonsense and frameshift) that have been reported in 4 probands in 3 publications (PMIDs: 21276947, 29390993, 34092786) are included in this curation. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be LOF, but it is still unclear. In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Epilepsy Gene Curation Expert Panel on the meeting date 12/06/2022 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/583bdf95-b87b-4838-96ea-b049845af19e","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d1713884-4e19-4810-b73f-871645cfc0c3","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d1713884-4e19-4810-b73f-871645cfc0c3_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10005","date":"2022-12-29T16:41:16.137Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d1713884-4e19-4810-b73f-871645cfc0c3_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10005","date":"2022-12-29T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d1713884-4e19-4810-b73f-871645cfc0c3_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d1713884-4e19-4810-b73f-871645cfc0c3_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/851b0822-f50c-4865-ae42-fc5d5fb665c4","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Even though the Drosophila model showed seizures, the Drosophila has only one prickle gene but does not have a homolog of specific PRICKLE2 of the human genome.
