Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data. At least 3 variants (missense and nonsense) have been reported in humans (PMID: 23936043, 35062939). TNC has a gnomAD pLOF constraint score of 0.45 and lack of funcional assays call into question the pathogenicity of the reported nonsense variant. Therefore the two missense variants that have been reported in 2 probands in 1 publications (PMID: 23936043) are included in this curation. Missense variants in this gene segregated with the disease in 14 additional family members. This gene-disease association is supported by expression studies (PMIDs: 10102501, 22808246). In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the ClinGen Hearing Loss GCEP on 3/20/18. It was reevaluated on 6/15/22. As a result of this reevaluation, new case-level information was incorporated and the overall classification remained at Limited.(SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/21a769e2-2655-458f-b21e-6a9ef1c1cdbe","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fce4988a-fb20-4f95-b73a-799c47b67e3b","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","changes":{"id":"cg:classificationChange"},"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fce4988a-fb20-4f95-b73a-799c47b67e3b_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2022-09-29T13:31:22.120Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fce4988a-fb20-4f95-b73a-799c47b67e3b_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2022-07-13T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fce4988a-fb20-4f95-b73a-799c47b67e3b_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fce4988a-fb20-4f95-b73a-799c47b67e3b_seg_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1a713b70-f10f-44d5-bb49-c5bcf0a20a22_family_segregation","type":"FamilyCosegregation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23936043","rdfs:label":"F013","family":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1a713b70-f10f-44d5-bb49-c5bcf0a20a22","type":"Family","rdfs:label":"F013"},"meetsInclusionCriteria":true,"phenotypeFreeText":"postlingual, symmetrical, and bilateral nonsyndromic sensorineural hearing loss. presented as mild in low frequencies with subsequent gradual progression to severe level involving all frequencies with time.
