{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1deb928f-205f-4cba-a06c-a9b5cddcfaa5v1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"*SS18L1* (HGNC:15592) was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in 2013 (Chesi A et al., PMID: 23708140). *SS18L1* encodes a calcium-responsive transactivator (CREST) that is an essential subunit of a neuron-specific chromatin-remodeling complex (nBAF). *SS18L1* is expressed only in postmitotic neurons and regulates dendritic length. There are 5 variants (one nonsense, three missense, and one in-frame del) that have been reported in 5 probands in 3 publications (PMIDs: 23708140, 24360741, 31522742) that are included in this curation, one of which was not scored due to the patient harboring a variant in another ALS-causing gene and a high minor allele frequency in population databases. ALS-associated *SS18L1* variants are suggested to dysregulate neuronal function by inhibiting dendrite outgrowth and microglial activation through a dominant-negative mechanism, however there is an absence of functional data from primary tissue of *SS18L1* mutation carriers. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence (mouse models, expression, and protein interactions; PMIDs: 30976389, 14716005, 23708140). CREST knockout (Crest +/− ) and Q394X knock-in mice generated through CRISPR/Cas9 system displayed deficits in motor coordination and partially recapitulated ALS phenotypes (PMID: 30976389). In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the ClinGen ALS GCEP on the meeting date May 25, 2023 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1deb928f-205f-4cba-a06c-a9b5cddcfaa5","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6e148a06-50fc-45f3-90ea-023dc8687577","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6e148a06-50fc-45f3-90ea-023dc8687577_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10096","date":"2023-06-30T19:43:41.427Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6e148a06-50fc-45f3-90ea-023dc8687577_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10096","date":"2023-05-25T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6e148a06-50fc-45f3-90ea-023dc8687577_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/785588c1-67bb-494e-b9f3-a6832cc33bea","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"This is an inframe deletion variant which was not found in gnomAD.
