Since then, eight more families with PME and the same variant have been reported in six studies. Patients with this condition initially develop normally, but have generalized tonic-clonic seizures, myoclonus seizures, myoclonus, cognitive and motor decline, and ataxia. The onset varies from 3 to 14 years of age. In addition to PME, KCNC1 is also associated with autosomal dominant complex neurodevelopmental disorder, which is curated separately. The mechanism of pathogenicity of the p.Arg320His variant appears to be dominant negative according to functional studies. The variant was confirmed de novo in 12 probands who received 1 pt each. The other 9 families received 0.5 pts each. One family with a different variant, c.949C>A, p.Arg317Ser, also had PME, and received 0.5 pts, because a functional study of the variant revealed a dominant negative effect. In total, maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts) has been reached. In summary, KCNC1 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant progressive myoclonus epilepsy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time.\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7796e72d-16bc-4778-8ce8-90a30d109a92","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/35d2beba-40f6-472d-842c-41925f486ba9","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/35d2beba-40f6-472d-842c-41925f486ba9_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10005","date":"2022-11-07T20:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/35d2beba-40f6-472d-842c-41925f486ba9_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10005","date":"2022-11-08T05:40:22.384Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/35d2beba-40f6-472d-842c-41925f486ba9_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/49de7e9c-e0cf-4e5d-9c40-06962c8d93ae","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/49de7e9c-e0cf-4e5d-9c40-06962c8d93ae_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"2-electrode voltage clump in Xenopus laevis showed almost zero current at +60mV.

In addition, 1:1 transfections with Kv3.1WT and Kv3.1Arg320His resulted in a significant reduction in the peak current amplitude (approximately 70% at +40 mV) when compared to Kv3.1WT. This indicates that Kv3.1Arg320His works in a dominantly negative manner, which is also supported by others, although the absolute reduction in current amplitude following co-expression of the mutated with the WT Kv3.1 channels is slightly different (80% at +60 mV and 25% at +80 mV, respectively) in these studies. In our hands, there was no significant difference in the current levels between heteromeric and homomeric Kv3.1Arg320His, unlike studies from Xenopus oocytes where currents via Kv3.1Arg320His were barely detectable (Muona et al., 2015). This discrepancy could be caused by differences in amphibian and mammalian intracellular transport, as well as the different experimental conditions. Furthermore, we find a reduced (but not complete absent) plasma membrane localization of the Kv3.1Arg320His channel, which may explain the reduced current amplitude in cells expressing Kv3.1Arg320His or Kv3.1WT+Arg320His.  Our data indicate that the prototype Kv3 channel activator, RE01, enhance both WT and mutated Kv3.1 channel open probability with a concomitant shift in the voltage-dependence of activation in a hyperpolarized direction. Further, both activation- and deactivation (only statistically significant for Kv3.1WT)\nkinetics are altered by RE01, again indicating that the compound act as a gaiting modifier of both WT and mutated Kv3.1 channels. The activation of Kv3.1 channels upon membrane depolarization is significantly faster in the presence of RE01 resulting in a higher K+ conductance at physiological relevant membrane potentials. These observations suggest that small molecule pharmacological modulators of Kv3 channel activity may constitute a plausible treatment option in patients carrying the MEAK mutation where normal Kv3.1 channel function is impaired.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29894724","rdfs:label":"Biophysical Channel Properties"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fd35ff40-2bad-4b07-a482-ac451812b0af","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Variant-level functional evidence","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Inconclusive","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/10bc17eb-d861-47e2-998e-c92475796260","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"In contrast to reported complete or partial reductions in expression in some experi- mental conditions, KV3.1bR320H produced WT-like current amplitude in our conditions.

To explore the molecular mechanism of alleviation of disease symptoms at elevated body temperature observed in some MEAK patients, we measured channel\nproperties at 36C and 39C.  Earlier work has shown that human ether-\u0002a-go-go–related gene (hERG), KV2.1 (KCNB1), and KV4.3 (KCND3) have temperature sensitivity.  No such data could be found for KV3.1 channels, and here we show that elevated temperature causes a hyperpolarizing shift in the voltage dependence of activation and an increase in the rate of inactivation in the WT channel. Interestingly, for both parameters the mutant channels showed blunted changes with elevated temperature.  \n\nWith respect to the mechanism underlying alleviation of symptoms with temperature, the most parsimonious explanation is that the hyperpolarizing shift in the activation voltage of channels comprised only of WT subunits is beneficial. The precise number of such channels in vivo is difficult to predict, but is expected to be approximately 6% assuming equal expression of WT and mutant alleles. A leftward shift in this residuum of WT-only channels will result in increased current magnitude that would directly counter the reduced currents seen in mutant channels.  The blunted temperature-dependent inactivation seen in the mutant channels may also contribute by maintaining channel availability during elevations in temperature.  Thus, in patients harboring mutant subunits, temperature dependent improvement of symptoms could be due to increased availability of WT-only channels in combination with the maintenance of the availability of mutant channels.  A net increase in KV3.1 channel availability would enhance the ability of interneuron firing and consequently reduce network excitability.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28380698","rdfs:label":"In vivo analysis of channel properties"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ec3d7d4f-d7ed-4f13-8a82-f0ec35931c77","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Variant-level functional evidence","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Inconclusive","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bd9ca257-1d89-4eb6-ad48-5ee5e0f9c70e","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"To assess the effects of the p.Arg320His substitution on channel function, we used the Xenopus laevis oocyte expression system and automated two-electrode voltage clamp.

Unlike many other potassium channels which are expressed in a variety of tissues (see review by Chandy and Gutman, 1995), expression of the Kv3.1 gene is restricted to the nervous system, except for a subpopulation of T lymphocytes (Luneau et al., 1991; Drewe et al., 1992; Grissmeret al., 1992).  Studies of the distribution of Kv3.1 mRNAs in the rat central nervous system (CNS) using in situ hybridization and single-cell polymerase chain reaction (PCR) have shown that the Kv3.1gene is expressed in a speciﬁc subset of neurons (Perney et al., 1992b, Drewe et al., 1992; Weiseret al., 1994; Massengill et al., 1997) and that the two splice variants, Kv3.1a and Kv3.1b are coexpressed in the same neurons (Perney et al., 1992b).  Many of the neurons that express high levels of Kv3.1 mRNA and protein have been characterized electrophysiologically to have narrow action potentials and display high-frequency ﬁring rates.  For example, a subset of neurons of the neocortex, the hippocampus, and the striatum that express high levels of Kv3.1 channels were characterized by double labeling to correspond to neurons containing parvalbumin, a calcium-binding protein; Lenz et al., 1994; Weiser etal., 1995; Du et al., 1996).  The presence of parvalbumin is believed to serve as a calcium buffer in neurons with fast-ﬁring properties (Celio and Heizmann, 1981).  Other neurons that express high levels of Kv3.1 include cerebellar granule cells, and neurons in the substantia nigra reticulata, reticular thalamic nuclei, globus pallidus, pontine reticular nucleus, and reticulotegmental nucleus of the pons.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9777733","rdfs:label":"Expression ","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":5321,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria9","strengthScore":12,"subject":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/oZorqY2htn8","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0020074","gene":"hgnc:6233","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"1.0","websiteLegacyID":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/assertion_35d2beba-40f6-472d-842c-41925f486ba9-","@context":{"@vocab":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"},"curationReasons":{"@type":"@vocab","@container":"@set"},"GCISnapshot":{"@type":"@id"},"dc:isVersionOf":{"@type":"@id"},"websiteLegacyID":{"@type":"@id"}}}
