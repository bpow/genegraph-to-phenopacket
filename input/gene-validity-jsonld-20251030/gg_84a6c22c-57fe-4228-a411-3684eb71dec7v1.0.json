Canavan disease is an autosomal recessive leukodystrophy, characterized by fatal spongiform encephalopathy of the brain. For most affected patients, onset of symptoms occurs in the first months of life, with hypotonia, macrocephaly, developmental delays, and seizures. These children usually pass away in early childhood. Later onset, milder forms of the condition have also been described (Matalon et al, 2018, PMID 20301412). Canavan disease is most prevalent in individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, but has been reported in individuals of many different ethnicities (Matalon et al, 2018, PMID 20301412). ASPA, the gene implicated in Canavan disease, encodes aspartoacylase, an enzyme that converts N-acetylaspartic acid (NAA) into acetate and aspartic acid. In patients with Canavan disease, NAA is elevated in patient urine and blood. The disease mechanism is loss of function.\nBiallelic variants in ASPA were first reported in patients with Canavan disease in 1993 (Kaul et al, PMID 8252036). Since then, about 70 variants in ASPA have been associated with Canavan disease (https://databases.lovd.nl/shared/variants/ASPA/unique), including two variants, p.Gla285Ala and p.Tyr231Ter, that together account for 98% of alleles in Ashkenazi Jewish patients, and another variant, p.Ala305Glu, that accounts for 30-60% of alleles in non-Jewish patients (Matalon et al, 2018, PMID 20301412).\nThe relationship between ASPA and Canavan disease is supported by case-level and experimental evidence. Sixteen unique variants (missense, frameshift, and nonsense) in 16 probands from 7 publications were curated (Kaul et al, 1993, PMID 8252036; Kaul et al, 1994, PMID 8023850; Kaul et al, 1996, PMID 8659549; Zen et al, 2002, PMID 12638939; Janson et al, 2006, PMID 16437572; Mendes et al, 2017, PMID 28101991; Froukh, 2019, PMID 30834272). Further information is available in the literature but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. \nExperimental evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes the biochemical function of ASPA, which is consistent with the biochemical findings and disease process in patients (Kaul et al, 1991, PMID 1987315; Kaul et al 1993, PMID 8252036; Hoshino and Kubota et al, 2014, PMID 24977939 von Jonquieres et al, 2018, PMID  29116375), the features of a mouse model, Deaf14, which is homozygous for a nonsense variant in Aspa (Carpinelli et al, 2014, PMID 24682784), and gene therapy studies in mice and humans (Leone et al, 2012, PMID 23253610; Carpanelli et al, 2014, PMID 24682784). Further evidence is available in the literature but the maximum score for experimental evidence (6 points) has been reached.\nIn summary, ASPA is definitively associated with Canavan disease. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This clinical validity classification was approved by the ClinGen Aminoacidopathy Gene Curation Expert Panel.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/84a6c22c-57fe-4228-a411-3684eb71dec7","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/66306eff-659f-4508-a41b-1820e47e0e1d","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/66306eff-659f-4508-a41b-1820e47e0e1d_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10011","date":"2020-10-15T21:06:25.645Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/66306eff-659f-4508-a41b-1820e47e0e1d_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10011","date":"2020-10-08T16:17:01.633Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/66306eff-659f-4508-a41b-1820e47e0e1d_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/66306eff-659f-4508-a41b-1820e47e0e1d_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/97974703-5097-4638-a5e6-594ffb964f97","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The score is increased because the mice are homozygous for a loss of function variant, as is observed in human cases, and several key features of Canavan disease are present.

NAA appears to be synthesized exclusively in neurons. NAA and its related dipeptide N‐acetyl‐aspartyl‐glutamate (NAAG) are transported from the cytoplasm to the extracellular space by transporters, and NAA is taken up by oligodendrocytes through a dicarboxylic acid transporter prior to being hydrolyzed by ASPA (see Figure 4). Of note, the precise function of NAA in the central nervous system remains unknown. Several theories for the pathogenesis of Canavan disease are discussed including that the conversion of NAA to acetate is important in the production of myelin (therefore lack of acetate due to deficiency of ASPA could cause the neurodegeneration see in Canavan disease), and that abnormal acetylation of histones (again due to lack of acetate) may be the cause of previously noted abnormal gene expression within the brain. It has also been suggested that elevated NAA in the brain may result in abnormal osmotic pressure causing the spongy degeneration, fluid accumulation, vacuolation, and swollen astrocytes observed in Canavan disease, but this remains debatable.\nIn summary, this review article not only cites evidence for the biochemical function of ASPA but also discusses how deficiency of ASPA and resultant elevation of NAA and lack of acetate may be involved in the pathogenesis of the disease.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24977939","rdfs:label":"Review of role of ASPA in Canvan disease pathology","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/86f1bfb7-8e33-413a-bc01-a85ca76feea7","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6d0bf597-3274-4fdc-af2a-59f55f2b3545","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Aspartoacylase, which was first described in 1952 (Birnbaum et al, PMID 14927637), catalyzes the breakdown of N-acetyl-L-aspartate (NAA) to L-aspartate and acetate.

Hence, these results are included here, under Biochemical Evidence.\nThe authors showed that ASPA is exclusively expressed in oligodendrocytes and that these cells are at the root of Canavan disease pathology. Transgenic mice with extra copies of the Nat8l gene (involved in NAA synthesis), under the neuronal Thy-1 promoter and in the Aspa WT background (ThyNAT mice), did not show signs of neurotoxicity even though they had higher NAA levels in the cortex than ASPA knock out mice. In these mice, NAA accumulation does not occur in oligodendrocytes due to normal ASPA function. Therefore, elevated NAA in the brain alone does not appear to be responsible for disease pathology. Rather, NAA toxicity appears to depend on the lack of its degradation in oligodendocytes. This indicated that the normal ASPA activity in the oligodendrocytes of ThyNAT mice was able to keep oligodendrocyte NAA at normal concentrations, preventing disease.\nDeletion of the Aspa gene exclusively in oligodendrocytes triggered a Canavan disease-like pathology, with delayed progression and partially attenuated late-stage severity.
