Some of the most common phenotypes observed among patients in this curation are neonatal respiratory distress, bronchitis, bronchiectasis, rhinorrhea, recurrent wet cough, otitis media and rotational ciliary movement rather than planar whiplash ciliary movement. Male and female infertility have been reported, while nasal nitric oxide levels could be either low or near the low end of the normal range. All of the probands found had normal abdominal situs. Electron microscopy findings sometimes included central complex defects but rarely showed inner or outer dynein arm abnormalities.\n\nThis curation has included eight variants (3 missense, 1 splice site, 2 nonsense, 1 start-loss and 1 in-frame deletion) that have been reported in 12 probands in 7 publications (PMIDs: 35046476, 33577779, 31285900, 36873931, 36059358, 19200523, 25789548). The in-frame deletion was a potential founder variant observed among a number of probands of Middle Eastern or Mediterranean origin (PMID: 35046476, PMID: 20070851). *RSPH9* variants co-segregated with PCD in at least two affected families (PMID:36059358, PMID: 19200523). The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss of function as shown by the presence of null variants and the absence of RSPH9 staining in the cells of some of the probands (PMID: 36873931).\n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by multiple forms of experimental evidence. High levels of expression of *RSPH9* were observed in human tissues associated with PCD (fallopian tube, testis and lung, PMID:23715323) and has been confirmed in mouse tissues (PMID:30383886). *RSPH9* encodes a component of the ‘head’ structure of ciliary radial spoke complexes (PMID: 36873931), a role shared by the *RSPH1* gene that has previously been linked to PCD 24. RSPH9 localizes to the kinocilia in zebrafish, indicating that the protein may affect ciliary formation and function in this organism (PMID: 27687975). Depleting *Rsph9* from multiciliated mouse ependymal cells (mEPCs) by RNAi found that the ciliary beat pattern became rotational, similar to the PCD patients (PMID: 19200523). Two different mouse knockouts of *Rsph9* both resulted in hydrocephalus and sinusitis (PMID: 27626380, PMID: 32709945).\n\nIn conclusion, *RSPH9* is definitively associated with autosomal recessive primary ciliary dyskinesia 12. This classification has been clearly demonstrated through both experimental and genetic evidence in a combination of clinical and laboratory settings and has been upheld over time without the emergence of contradictory evidence. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Motile Ciliopathy GCEP on October 12th, 2023 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0854c860-986c-4c9a-b293-e7b7e6c4a00b","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/25b8ea38-8de2-45b7-95a1-51b33affb747","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/25b8ea38-8de2-45b7-95a1-51b33affb747_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10102","date":"2024-01-01T04:16:01.728Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/25b8ea38-8de2-45b7-95a1-51b33affb747_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10102","date":"2023-10-12T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/25b8ea38-8de2-45b7-95a1-51b33affb747_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/58a8e178-b872-461a-85a2-56938774ff9b_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/58a8e178-b872-461a-85a2-56938774ff9b","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25789548","rdfs:label":"OP-1665

Initially, she was on a high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) of eight liters per minute with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 35%. She was treated for clinical sepsis with five days of antibiotics. Her respiratory distress improved with respiratory support. She needed oxygen for a total period of 14 days, and then she was observed for two days without supplemental oxygen before being discharged. The genetic testing was requested based on unexplained respiratory distress with normal chest X-ray and normal echocardiography.\n\nFour months later, the patient was admitted to another hospital with fever and respiratory symptoms for two days. After a month, she presented to the emergency department with fever and increased work of breathing; pneumonia was confirmed and treated with HFNC 14 L/min with FiO2 of 25%. Intravenous antibiotics were continued for ten days, bronchodilators and a 3% normal saline nebulizer with chest physiotherapy were provided. Chest X-ray showed that the right upper lobe had collapsed (Figure ​(Figure2).2). The respiratory culture isolated Streptococcus pneumonia, and the respiratory multiplex was positive for rhino/enterovirus. After completing the antibiotic course, the baby was discharged home. Since then, the baby has done well; she only had to continue chest physiotherapy and hypertonic nebulizer 3%.\n\nAt 12 hours of age, the patient developed tachypnea with desaturation in room air, she had continuous thick whitish oral secretion. Admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) for further management, her initial blood investigation, including blood gas and chest X-ray, was normal. A full sepsis workup was done. Complete blood cell count revealed a white blood cell count of 6,000/mL with a normal differential, hemoglobin of 15.8 g/dL, and platelet count of 250×103/μL.\n\nPatient's appearance, pulse, grimace, activity, and respiration (APGAR) scores were nine and nine at one and five minutes, respectively, and her weight was 4 kg. Her vital signs were stable (temperature of 36.9ºC; heart rate of 150 beats/min; respiratory rate of 55 breaths/min; blood pressure of 66/40 mmHg; oxygen saturation of 96%), and the initial newborn examination presented normal results.\n\nPatient's parents were consanguineous - first cousins. Patient's mother was diabetic. Patient was born at 41+6 weeks of gestation via an emergency Cesarean section due to abnormal fetal heart rhythm and has three siblings diagnosed with bronchial asthma and chronic otitis media.\n\nMaternal laboratory findings are as follows: hepatitis B was negative; group B Streptococcus was positive.","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0031245","obo:HP_0002789"],"sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/30a25bfb-83c0-45a3-8350-0bbded343342_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36059358","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7cbd456b-56cc-45d1-b178-6c396756c236"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"}}},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/30a25bfb-83c0-45a3-8350-0bbded343342","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Half scoring has been performed to account for a potential founder variant.","calculatedScore":0.2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/30a25bfb-83c0-45a3-8350-0bbded343342_variant_evidence_item"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4f61b5cd-594b-499f-a44c-1418636b1051_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Inconclusive","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria","strengthScore":0},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c39c2739-dd30-4839-a3e6-12224dc9d2f9_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c39c2739-dd30-4839-a3e6-12224dc9d2f9","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25789548","rdfs:label":"OP-601 II1","ageType":"AgeAtDiagnosis","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":3,"allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7cbd456b-56cc-45d1-b178-6c396756c236"},"detectionMethod":"Whole-Exome Sequencing, IF microscopy of respiratory epithelial cells, Sanger sequencing.","firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"Patient's consanguinity status is unknown.
