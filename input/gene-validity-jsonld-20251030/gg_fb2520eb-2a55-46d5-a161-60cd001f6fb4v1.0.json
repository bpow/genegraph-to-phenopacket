{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fb2520eb-2a55-46d5-a161-60cd001f6fb4v1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"*MCM4* was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive inheritance of primary immunodeficiency with natural-killer cell deficiency and adrenal insufficiency in 2012 (Hughes et al., PMID: 22354170) and (Gineau et al., PMID: 22354167). This condition is characterized by adrenal failure, short stature, and natural killer (NK) cell deficiency. Affected individuals are also typically susceptible to recurrent infections. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data. The only identified variant (a hypomorphic splice site mutation) in this gene has been reported in 7 probands, segregating with disease in five families from the Irish Traveler community. (PMIDs: 22354170, 22354167, 22499342).\n\nThis gene-disease relationship is supported by its biochemical function, expression studies, functional assays, rescue studies, and a mouse model (PMIDs: 22354170, 22354167, 10567526, 17143284). In healthy subjects, *MCM4* is part of a complex genetic machinery responsible for genome stability and correct DNA replication with a role in single strand DNA binding (PMID: 10567526). In FGD patients, the specific impact of MCM4 variants is not fully understood but in a functional assay supports the hypothesis that the lack of full length *MCM4* results in selective lack of CD56dim in NK cells (PMID: 22354167). The same author detected no full-length *MCM4* protein in patient 1.2 (P1.2) EBV-B cells as well as P1.3 and P2.1 primary and SV40 fibroblasts, by Western blotting (Gineau et al., PMID: 22354167). In addition, Hughes et al, completed another expression study using immunoblotting in which control subjects were observed to have two main protein species, of approximately 96 and 85 kDa, while predicted full-length 96-kDa product is missing in the patients (Hughes et al., PMID: 22354170). Gineau et al., also addressed the impact of the mutated *MCM4* allele on DNA replication itself by investigating the cell cycle and DNA content in SV40 fibroblasts and identified a rescue. WT *MCM4* or the patients’ *MCM4* allele were expressed in patient fibroblasts and authors assessed the breakage phenotype to demonstrate that the observed genomic instability was due to the absence of the full-length MCM4 in the patients’ cells. Expression of the WT allele greatly decreased the number of DNA breaks per metaphase, whereas expression of the mutant allele did not (PMID: 22354167). Lastly, a mouse model with a hypomorphic *MCM4* allele recapitulated the increased genomic instability observed in patients, though it lacked additional features of the disease (PMID: 17143284).\n\nIn summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fb2520eb-2a55-46d5-a161-60cd001f6fb4","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9386eb47-5424-4f27-94d5-0d6709a6587e","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9386eb47-5424-4f27-94d5-0d6709a6587e_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10081","date":"2023-08-17T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9386eb47-5424-4f27-94d5-0d6709a6587e_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10081","date":"2023-09-21T14:39:51.647Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9386eb47-5424-4f27-94d5-0d6709a6587e_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c4558491-402a-4671-a284-0c9e5577e77b_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fe56c395-ff42-4965-9d92-0794a7cf0aee","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Recurrent

In the absence of aphidicolin treatment, the proportion of cells in the G1 and S phases was lower in the patients than in the controls, whereas the proportion of cells in G2/M phase was higher. The DNA content of the patients’ SV40 fibroblasts was also abnormal, with an 8C/2C ratio much higher than that in control SV40 fibroblasts, indicating disruption of the coordination of DNA replication. Treatment with aphidicolin amplified this phenotype. Thus, MCM4 mutation affects DNA replication by disrupting the normal control of the prevention of re-replication and having an impact on the mitotic phase.\n\nComplete and accurate DNA replication is essential for the maintenance of genetic integrity in all organisms. When replication is compromised, the DNA becomes more prone to breakage.  Genomic instability was assessed in the presence and absence of aphidicolin treatment in SV40 fibroblasts from patients and controls, through assessment of chromatid breaks and chromosome exchanges. The mean number of breaks per metaphase differed significantly between patients and controls, with values of 0.82 obtained for control cells and of 9.25 and 10.79 for cells from P1.3 and P2.1, respectively.\n\nThe authors then expressed the WT MCM4 or the patients’ MCM4 allele in patient fibroblasts and assessed the breakage phenotype, to demonstrate that the observed genomic instability was due to the absence of the full-length MCM4 in the patients’ cells. Expression of the WT allele greatly decreased the number of DNA breaks per metaphase (from 9.7 to 3.6 breaks per metaphase for the WT allele), whereas expression of the mutant allele did not.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22354167","rdfs:label":"Genomic instability","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:PhenotypeRescue"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellRescueCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9386eb47-5424-4f27-94d5-0d6709a6587e_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4e00b878-f2bf-43f8-93b2-49b1e9220ba1","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a7f06c27-c489-4636-9714-a72cd7456564","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Gineau et al; utilized single-cell flow cytometry analysis of intracytoplasmic CFSE dilution and 7-AAD staining.
