{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b9c67219-0f3d-4b3b-a4c6-328451e77811v1.1","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"The BANF1 gene is located on chromosome 11 at 11q13.1 and encodes the barrier to autointegration nuclear assembly factor 1 protein, a non-specific DNA-binding protein that plays key roles in mitotic nuclear reassembly, chromatin organization, DNA damage response, gene expression and intrinsic immunity against foreign DNA. BANF1 was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Néstor-Guillermo Progeria Syndrome (NGPS) in 2011 (Puente et al., PMID: 21549337;). NGPS is a unique progeria with a relatively long lifespan with features such as signs of aging, growth delay, reduced subcutaneous fat, decreased diameter of limbs, and stiffening of the joints. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found clear differences in inheritance pattern and phenotypic variability between the following disease entities which have therefore been split: autosomal recessive NGPS and BANF1-related neurodevelopmental disorder. The split curation for autosomal dominant BANF1-related neurodevelopmental disorder has been curated separately.\n\nOne missense variant (possible founder variant in Spanish families) that has been reported in 3 probands in 2 publications (PMIDs: 21549337, 32783369) is included in this curation. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss-of-function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence, including protein interaction and biochemical functional evidence, specifically interaction evidence with lamin, and function in DNA stability/repair activity (PMIDs: 36039758, 33660778). In summary, there is limited evidence supporting the relationship between BANF1 and autosomal recessive NGPS. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Syndromic Disorders GCEP on the meeting date April 3rd, 2024 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b9c67219-0f3d-4b3b-a4c6-328451e77811","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2e2059e5-b7a5-42fe-93b7-182982608431","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","changes":{"id":"cg:sopChange"},"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2e2059e5-b7a5-42fe-93b7-182982608431_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10060","date":"2024-04-03T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2e2059e5-b7a5-42fe-93b7-182982608431_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10060","date":"2024-09-26T14:25:23.351Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2e2059e5-b7a5-42fe-93b7-182982608431_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/53b67842-fd6b-46ef-824f-8ee81fbe4d5c_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/53b67842-fd6b-46ef-824f-8ee81fbe4d5c","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32783369","rdfs:label":"Fisher p.Ala12Thr proband ","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":2,"allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/de92d078-43d2-41a2-a6e5-c5e31200aaa5","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_003860.4(BANF1):c.34G>A (p.Ala12Thr)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA129181"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"respiratory distress in the first 24 hours of life;
