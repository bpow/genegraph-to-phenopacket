Loss of function variants in *BUB1* have been implicated in chromosomal segregation errors and aneuploidy. Biallelic *BUB1* mutations are associated with primary microcephaly-30 (MCPH30). Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found differences in inheritance pattern and phenotypic variability; therefore the autosomal recessive condition has been split and this curation solely focuses on autosomal dominant colorectal cancer. Germline variants in *BUB1* were first reported in humans with colorectal cancer as early as 2013 (de Voer, et al., PMID: 23747338). At least 5 variants (truncating, missense, and splicing variants) identified in 5 individuals with colon cancer from 2 publications  were included in this curation (2.7 points, PMID: 23747338, 29448935). These individuals were noted to have polyposis, mosaic aneuploidy, and/or mild dysmorphic features. However, a case-control study (PMID:27713038) found no evidence supporting *BUB1* and hereditary colorectal cancer (scored as contradictory evidence). Experimental evidence was included in this curation (1 point, PMIDs: 9521327, 11283619). Co-immunoprecipitation assay demonstrated that BUB1 interacts with APC. Colorectal cancer cell lines with *BUB1* mutations showed chromosomal instability. In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship of *BUB1* and autosomal dominant colorectal cancer. This curation was approved by the ClinGen Hereditary Cancer GCEP on 6/23/2023 (SOP Version 9).\nSummary of Genetic Evidence: 2.7 points; \nExperimental Evidence: 1 point; \nTotal: 3.7 points.
