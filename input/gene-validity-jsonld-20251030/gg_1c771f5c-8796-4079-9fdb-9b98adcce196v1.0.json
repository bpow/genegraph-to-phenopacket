{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1c771f5c-8796-4079-9fdb-9b98adcce196v1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"The relationship between *MT-ND3* and primary mitochondrial disease was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of March 6, 2023. *MT-ND3* is located at m.10059-10404 of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) genome and encodes the NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) core subunit ND3. Defects of this protein lead to complex I deficiency. \n\n*MT-ND3* was first reported in relation to primary mitochondrial disease in 2001 (PMID: 11456298). While various names have been given to the constellation of features seen in those with *MT-ND3*-related disease, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *MT-ND3* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework. Of note, *MT-ND3* was previously curated by this panel for its association with Leigh syndrome spectrum (LSS) on March 24, 2021 (SOP v8), with a final classification of definitive. This current curation for the association with primary mitochondrial disease includes cases with LSS.\n\nEvidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation includes five variants (m.10134C>A, m.10158T>C, m.10191T>C, m.10197G>A, m.10254G>A) in 18 probands from 11 publications (PMIDs: 1928099, 14705112, 14764913, 17152068, 20202874, 25118196, 25384404, 11456298, 19458970, 30199507, 29237403). All curated variants were missense and three were recurrent (m.10158T>C, m.10191T>C, m.10197G>A). Affected individuals present with a broad phenotypic spectrum of clinical features including LSS; Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON); mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS); lactic acidosis, epilepsia partialis continua (EPC), epileptic encephalopathy, dystonia, and optic atrophy.  The age of onset is also highly variable, ranging from infantile to adult. Metabolic labs revealed elevated lactate in blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Muscle biopsy showed and complex I deficiency. \n\nHeteroplasmy levels in affected individuals ranged from 76% - homoplasmic in muscle, 10% - homoplasmic in blood, as well as at >98% in various other tissues (fibroblasts, liver).\n\nLoss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease association is also supported by known protein interaction and functional alteration in patient fibroblast cells (PMIDs: 27509854, 14705112).    \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support this gene-disease relationship, including that more than three years have elapsed from the first proposal of the association. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on March 6, 2023 (SOP Version 9).
