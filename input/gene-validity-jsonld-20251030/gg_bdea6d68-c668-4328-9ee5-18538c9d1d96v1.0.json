{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bdea6d68-c668-4328-9ee5-18538c9d1d96v1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"The relationship between *NDUFC2* and primary mitochondrial disease was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of December 18, 2023. The *NDUFC2* gene encodes the NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) subunit C2, which also plays a role in complex I assembly. Defects of this protein lead to complex I deficiency.\n\nThe first and only report of *NDUFC2* in relation to autosomal recessive primary mitochondrial disease was in 2020 (PMID:32969598) in two unrelated probands with Leigh syndrome spectrum (LSS). While various names could be given to the constellation of features seen in those with *NDUFC2*-related disease, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *NDUFC2* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework. Of note, *NDUFC2* was first curated by this GCEP for its association with LSS on November 23, 2020 (SOP Version 7), with a final classification of Moderate. This current curation for the association with primary mitochondrial disease includes cases with LSS.\n\nEvidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included\ntwo variants (homozygous missense and homozygous stop-loss) identified in two cases in one publication (PMID: 32969598). This gene-disease association is also supported by functional implication its known biochemical function (PMID: 27509854) and by complexome profiling in patient cells (PMID: 32969598). \n\nIn summary, there is moderate evidence to support the relationship between *NDUFC2* and primary mitochondrial disease. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on December 18, 2023 (SOP Version 9).
