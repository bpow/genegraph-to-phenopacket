It results in the biochemical phenotype of persistent hypertryptophanemia and hyperserotoninemia, but without any discernable clinical phenotype. Unbiased ascertainment by newborn screening strongly suggests that this is a benign biochemical variant of no clinical significance (PMIDs: 28285122). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Two unique variants (missense and frameshift) have been reported in the single human case (PMID: 28285122). This gene-disease association is supported by its biochemical function in tryptophan metabolism (PMID: 18027945) and a knockout mouse model (PMID: 19323847). In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship.\n\nThis gene-disease pair was previously evaluated by the Aminoacidopathy GCEP on 07/10/2020. It was reevaluated on 10/24/2023. As a result of this reevaluation, the classification remained Limited with no new evidence identified.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a8cefd3d-5896-4710-8ac0-3efeee86c262","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b20a4b6d-c43c-4397-bbd2-3d4c6ea6f0e0","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","changes":[{"id":"cg:sopChange"},{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"},{"id":"cg:summaryChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b20a4b6d-c43c-4397-bbd2-3d4c6ea6f0e0_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10011","date":"2023-12-08T17:40:21.275Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b20a4b6d-c43c-4397-bbd2-3d4c6ea6f0e0_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10011","date":"2023-11-17T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["RecurationTiming"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b20a4b6d-c43c-4397-bbd2-3d4c6ea6f0e0_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b20a4b6d-c43c-4397-bbd2-3d4c6ea6f0e0_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0991c92c-20e4-4505-8e76-e9d94eea3609","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"To quantify the activity of TDO, L-Trp the formation of N-formylkynurenine from L-Trp was followed by optical absorption spectroscopy.","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/dec84978-68bc-4cef-8698-fb7a08d11987","type":"Finding","dc:description":"TDO deficiency results in the biochemical phenotype of persistent hypertryptophanemia and hyperserotoninemia, but without any discernible clinical phenotype.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18027945","rdfs:label":"L-Tryptophan metabolism","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b20a4b6d-c43c-4397-bbd2-3d4c6ea6f0e0_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/33a0352c-1449-4f5f-b35c-8e67ca3beb88","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Knockout mice recapitulated increased plasma levels of tryptophan and serotonin.
