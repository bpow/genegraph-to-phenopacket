The disease mechanism is gain of function. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes genetic evidence (case-level and family data) and experimental evidence (biochemical functions and protein interaction).\n\nSummary of Case Level Data: 10.35 points: Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 13 probands in 12 publications (PMIDs: 9694695, 9425899, 10583217, 18367486, 22194398, 32430933, 19553636, 22453305, 32067437, 37962621, 38548144, 36811253). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 39 additional family members.\n\nSummary of Experimental Data: 1.5 points: This gene-disease relationship is supported by in vitro functional assays. *THPO* is directly involved in megakaryopoiesis and thrombopoiesis, and gain of function variants in *THPO* lead to increase in platelet counts (PMID: 23594368). Chen et al. showed that THPO physically interacts with MPL. (PMID: 20529857).\n\nIn summary, there is Definitive evidence to support the gene-disease relationship of *THPO* and autosomal dominant thrombocythemia 1. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.\n\nThis gene-disease pair was originally approved by the Hemostatis and Thrombosis GCEP on March 23, 2022. It was re-evaluated on May 01, 2024. As a result of this reevaluation, the classification increased from Moderate to Definitive with the addition three new probands (PMIDs: 37962621, 38548144, 36811253).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c0e20e00-5296-4b9f-a7a6-b04e64609739","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e99d3899-efbe-4cb9-9170-748ea92892ce","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":[{"id":"cg:newEvidence"},{"id":"cg:sopChange"},{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},{"id":"cg:classificationChange"},{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e99d3899-efbe-4cb9-9170-748ea92892ce_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2024-05-01T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e99d3899-efbe-4cb9-9170-748ea92892ce_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2024-05-17T20:14:16.320Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["RecurationTiming","RecurationNewEvidence"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e99d3899-efbe-4cb9-9170-748ea92892ce_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e99d3899-efbe-4cb9-9170-748ea92892ce_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9ccebef8-3c66-4205-b31e-f6792ebb6bca","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8bcc089a-58aa-4179-b9af-a7d09b446d66","type":"Finding","dc:description":"MPL is the receptor for TPO.
