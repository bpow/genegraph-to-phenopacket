One missense variant with MAF <=0.0001 was identified. In total, two SMAD1 missense variants with MAF <=0.0001 have been reported in two HPAH/IPAH probands in 2 publications (PMIDs: 21898662, 33007923). Experimental evidence for a relationship between SMAD1 and PAH is  supported by biochemical function from three publications (PMIDs: 18367643, 23478097, 21898662) and in conditional kock out mice in which a subset of KO mice developed pulmonary hypertension. However, the gene-disease relationship betwen SMAD1 and PAH is classified as disputed due to insufficient genetic evidence over multiple years of research. This classification was approved by the ClinGen PH Gene Curation Expert Panel on 8/30/2022 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a82f9aab-6037-4d60-851c-bf937198b10e","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/804f2eeb-7328-45c2-947b-cb9c4da0fecc","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"NoKnownDiseaseRelationship","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/804f2eeb-7328-45c2-947b-cb9c4da0fecc_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10071","date":"2022-11-21T21:20:25.408Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/804f2eeb-7328-45c2-947b-cb9c4da0fecc_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10071","date":"2022-11-21T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"Only two probands reported to have PAH and SMAD1 variants.
