Before the causal gene itself was characterized, examples of demyelinating neuropathies of variable severity with linkage to the \"Duffy Locus\" on chromosome 1 were relatively well-characterized (PMIDs: 6952764, 7130990, 4020397, etc.). Two independent groups examining the region mapped the human gene encoding a primary structural component protein in compact myelin, Myelin Protein Zero, to that region of the genome and verified that the causal variants in many neuropathy cases were in this MPZ gene (PMIDs: 7693129, 7504284). Over 200 unique variants (e.g. missense, in-frame indel, nonsense, frameshift, large deletion, complex rearrangement, etc) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes a more than sufficient amount of case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data. There have been numerous publications describing MPZ patients and the variants they harbor - we detail  11 probands with over 50 family members. Much more evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic and experimental evidence has been reached. The mechanism for disease is heterozygous gain of function, with pathogenic mutations having one of several potential effects on the overall system. Many variants affect specifically myelin compaction, disrupting the myelination process via localization other than the plasma membrane or by dominant-negative alteration of the overall myelin sheath. Notably, MPZ variants can also cause a phenotypically axonal neuropathy, potentially via disruption of Schwann cell - neuron interaction, however the pathomechanism is not fully understood (PMID: 16775378). This gene-disease association is additionally supported by multiple mouse models, expression studies, in vitro functional assays, and MPZ interactions with PMP22, another important structural protein. Multiple mouse models with known pathogenic MPZ mutations have been developed and well-characterized over the years. Functional assays have demonstrated that disruption of MPZ expression via antisense MPZ mRNA causes significantly disrupted myelination. In summary, MPZ is definitively associated with Autosomal Dominant Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5a1ed2e4-46db-414c-920c-0f307f240001","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/11f638d2-d8d2-4fe4-ab79-acff5cf32a18","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/11f638d2-d8d2-4fe4-ab79-acff5cf32a18_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10063","date":"2020-08-25T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/11f638d2-d8d2-4fe4-ab79-acff5cf32a18_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10063","date":"2020-10-05T15:09:12.204Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/11f638d2-d8d2-4fe4-ab79-acff5cf32a18_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/11f638d2-d8d2-4fe4-ab79-acff5cf32a18_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9779728c-d7f4-42a2-8663-0c0e32c683af","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Both of these transgenic mouse lines recapitulate the major phenotypes observed in human CMT probands, including neuromuscular degeneration, weakness and ataxia, and decreased nerve conduction velocities.

Overexpression of transgenic mRNA was <80% of endogenous MPZ, a level where WT overexpression produces no detectable neuropathy. Each line developed a neuromuscular disorder characteristic of CMT within a few weeks, with higher expression correlating with more obvious defects. Sciatic nerve examination confirmed severe hypomyelination and onion-bulb formation in even the low-expressing lines, reflecting severe phenotypes in human probands. Another generated line with similar expression levels to the heterozygous human probands, S63del//MPZ+/− mice, also demonstrated the decreased CMAP and axonal degeneration/demyelination and progressive symptoms characteristic of the human disease. Western blot analysis of mutant protein suggests that the S63del post-translational modification is altered and localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum while the S63C incorporates with WT and localizes to the myelin sheath. XRD analysis of the S63C mutant identified a packing defect even in the presence of WT MPZ, altering the myelination process and causing a dominant-negative effect on the protein. S63del was analysed with BiP and CHOP, mediators of the unfolded protein response, and altered levels showed a signfiicant UPR likely causing the gain-of-function disruption in schwann cells.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16495463","rdfs:label":"Transgenic MPZ Mice","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6812710c-33e2-4e99-ac8b-12418ea3e88f","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"This knock-in mouse model recapitulates many of the features commonly observed in human CMT probands, specifically both the neuromuscular phenotypes and the nerve biopsy signs with decreased myelination and large fiber loss.
