The study reported linkage to WDR36 in 7 families with primary open angle glaucoma and identifed four variants that were predicted to be disease causing. However, the variants are not supported by functional evidence -- they are found at relatively high population frequencies in gnomAD. \n\nThis gene-disease association has been studied in several case-control studies (PMID: 28658128, 29104481, 22025897, 18172102, 16723468, 19347049, 29540704, 17353431, 28282485, 19875670, 16876519); however, statistical significance was not reached in most. A meta-analysis (Liu et al, 2017; PMID: 28658128) including 5 individual studies reported no statistically significant association of WDR36 variants with primary open angle glaucoma.  \n\nWDR36 is expressed ubiquitously, including th eye (PMID: 15677485). The function of WDR36 is not clearly understood, but animal studies suggest a role in eye development. Zebrafish and mouse models show head and eye phenotypes (PMID: 20631153, 18469340); however, they are non-specific and do not support the role of WDR36 variation in glaucoma. With an unclear role for this gene in glaucoma, it is thought to have a modifier effect in disease (PMID: 29104481). \n\nIn summary, the evidence supporting the relationship between WDR36 and autosomal dominant primary open angle glaucoma has been disputed and no valid evidence remains to support the claim. More evidence is needed to either support or entirely refute the role WDR36 plays in glaucoma, but based on the evidence avaialble at this time, the gene is disputed as a monogenic cause of glaucoma.

No human patients with glaucoma are reported in the literature to carry pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants in WDR36. Case-control studies do not show enrichment of variants in cases vs controls and a meta analysis revealed no statistical significance in the association of WDR36 variants with glaucoma. While studies in animal models show that WDR36 may have a functional role in eye development, none of the models develop the expected glaucoma phenotype. Based on these observations, the WDR36-primary open angle glaucoma gene-disease relationship is disputed.","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/173858d9-f695-470f-b8b0-22940c60c074_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bea1c780-a584-4042-945c-b7afa5363be0","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Authors report that the c.1805A>G p.Asp602Gly variant (likely benign in ClinVar) was identified in 13/670 cases and 0/476 controls in this study.

For the variants, I264V: pooled-OR of 1.09 (95% CI: 0.94–1.28, P = .25, I2 = 0) and IVS5+30C>T: pooled-OR of 0.99 (95% CI: 0.71–1.39, P = .97, I2 = 77%). The authors note, \"existing data in the literature do not support a significant role of WDR36 in the genetic susceptibility of POAG or its subtypes\" \n\n","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e552a738-89d3-45bd-8543-dda0a3028bdd_cc_evidence_item","type":"Finding","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28658128","rdfs:label":"Liu_meta analysis","caseCohort":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/38869299-6bcd-44e7-943c-8bfdffab57f7","type":"Cohort","allGenotypedSequenced":1352,"alleleFrequency":0.6612426035502958,"detectionMethod":"This meta-analysis included 5 studies that genotyped individuals for WDR36 variants","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e552a738-89d3-45bd-8543-dda0a3028bdd_cc_evidence_item"}],"numWithVariant":894,"relatedCondition":{"id":"obo:MONDO_0012357"}},"controlCohort":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/50d38e04-f17f-46cc-bf1e-f3bc33260374","type":"Cohort","allGenotypedSequenced":894,"alleleFrequency":0.4384787472035794,"detectionMethod":"This meta-analysis included 5 studies that genotyped individuals for WDR36 variants","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e552a738-89d3-45bd-8543-dda0a3028bdd_cc_evidence_item"}],"numWithVariant":392},"method":{"id":"cg:AggregateVariantAnalysis"},"pValue":0.25,"statisticalSignificanceType":"","statisticalSignificanceValue":1.09,"statisticalSignificanceValueType":"Odds Ratio"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCaseControlAggregateVariantAnalysisCriteria","strengthScore":0},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f19aec77-43a4-4d0b-8b3c-860e87d491be","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"8 variants in 15 patients (12 with high IOP and 3 with low IOP) were determined to be disease-causing; however no functional evidence is available to score the evidence.","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f19aec77-43a4-4d0b-8b3c-860e87d491be_cc_evidence_item","type":"Finding","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18172102","rdfs:label":"Pasutto_German study","caseCohort":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/286f0b15-d5ae-4b74-be6b-ceb7eee43cb7","type":"Cohort","allGenotypedSequenced":399,"alleleFrequency":0.03759398496240601,"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f19aec77-43a4-4d0b-8b3c-860e87d491be_cc_evidence_item"}],"numWithVariant":15,"relatedCondition":{"id":"obo:MONDO_0012357"}},"controlCohort":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c64fbc2f-de0f-473f-82a7-e98d7f8fceea","type":"Cohort","allGenotypedSequenced":376,"alleleFrequency":0.002659574468085106,"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f19aec77-43a4-4d0b-8b3c-860e87d491be_cc_evidence_item"}],"numWithVariant":1},"method":{"id":"cg:AggregateVariantAnalysis"},"pValue":0.00050,"statisticalSignificanceType":"","statisticalSignificanceValueType":"Other"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCaseControlAggregateVariantAnalysisCriteria","strengthScore":0}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallCaseControlEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/173858d9-f695-470f-b8b0-22940c60c074_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/173858d9-f695-470f-b8b0-22940c60c074_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f2b435a3-0baf-4e9d-98c4-b287a5e9fab2","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Mice with WDR36 variants do not show a glaucoma phenotype.
