At least 5 variants (missense and nonsense) have been reported in humans in association with a phenotype consisting of neonatal diabetes, intrauterine growth retardation, cerebellar hypoplasia, sensorineural deafness, visual impairment, and intellectual disability. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Summary of case-level data: 5.25 points. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 8 probands in 4 publications (PMIDs: 29521454, 20573748, 12200761, 30259503). Of note, this gene has also been implicated in autosomal dominant monogenic diabetes (http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0015967), which is being assessed separately. This gene-disease relationship is supported by functional assays, expression studies, and animal models. BETA2 (encoded by NEUROD1) was shown to heterodimerize with the ubiquitous helix-loop-helix (HLH) protein E47 and then bind the INS gene promotor to regulate its transcription through yeast two-hybrid assays and transient transfection assays in HIT cells to measure transcriptional activity (PMID: 7774807). Mice homozygous for disruption of BETA2 developed hyperglycemia by 2 days of age with ketonuria, suggesting severe diabetes and insulin deficiency, with abnormal pancreatic islet morphology, reduction in insulin producing cells, and lack of mature (PMID: 9308961). NEUROD1 expression has been confirmed in pancreatic tissue (PMID: 24309898). In summary, NEUROD1 is moderately associated with autosomal recessive monogenic diabetes with a neurologic phenotype as described above. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f2cd229a-f0d0-4982-aa93-a32b006f93cb","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9ace1b58-44d4-4479-9328-0871a8fb0e9f","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9ace1b58-44d4-4479-9328-0871a8fb0e9f_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10016","date":"2021-03-10T17:28:25.345Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9ace1b58-44d4-4479-9328-0871a8fb0e9f_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10016","date":"2021-03-10T17:27:54.003Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9ace1b58-44d4-4479-9328-0871a8fb0e9f_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a9306170-df69-4f61-895e-502fa26b6dfd_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Variant reported in paper as NM_002500.4:c.364dup (p.Asp122GlyfsTer12);
