Two missense variants reported in two probands in a publication were included in this curation (PMID: 32380971). This gene-disease relationship is supported by expression studies and mouse models (PMIDs: 15591049, 11514558, 15169892, 15569937, 15929941). In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship.

Cardiac-specific ablation of SRF resulted in embryonic lethality due to cardiac insufficiency during chamber maturation. At 10.5 dpc, mutant hearts exhibited less constriction in the atrial ventricular canal and poorly developed intraventricular groove with several mutant embryos arrested at heart-looping stage thus suggesting that SRF could alter early morphological movement. The breadth of the mutant ventricular wall compact layer was greatly reduced, cellular wall expansion was blocked and the intraventricular septation was less developed. At 11.5 dpc, SRF cardiac-conditional knock-out embryos lost rhythmic beating and displayed severe pericardial effusion. Examination of transverse sections revealed the appearance of a hypoplastic ventricular wall in the mutant. Conditional ablation of SRF also reduced cell survival concomitant with increased apoptosis and reduced cellularity.
