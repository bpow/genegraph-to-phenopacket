MTHFR encodes methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase which converts 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate to 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, a cosubstrate for homocysteine remethylation to methionine. Deficiency of MTHFR is associated with elevated homocysteine and decreased methionine,  Variants in MTHFR were ﬁrst reported in humans with this deﬁciency in 1994 (Goyette et al., PMID 7920641. At least 109 unique variants (missense, nonsense, frameshift, splicing, deletion) have been identiﬁed in humans (Froese et al., 2016; PMID 26872964). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level and experimental data. This gene-disease relationship is supported by biochemical assays, in vitro studies and a mouse model. In summary, MTHFR is deﬁnitively associated with autosomal recessive homocystinuria due to methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase deficiency. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Aminoacidopathy Gene Curation Expert Panel on 6/18/19 (SOP Version 6).\n\nOf note, MTHFR polymorphisms have been associated with susceptibility to neural tube defects, schizophrenia, thromboembolism, and vascular disease. However, at this time, these entities are not included for analysis using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/27d5c1c8-6a79-4834-99ed-afcf11008912","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cbfc5297-ed0d-4d7c-bca6-747114ed2b17","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cbfc5297-ed0d-4d7c-bca6-747114ed2b17_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10011","date":"2019-06-18T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cbfc5297-ed0d-4d7c-bca6-747114ed2b17_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10011","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cbfc5297-ed0d-4d7c-bca6-747114ed2b17_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cbfc5297-ed0d-4d7c-bca6-747114ed2b17_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7b9d0da0-c38e-451b-9002-abcde4eb3a32","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/18180b91-3858-495a-b1b6-34c9ea252179","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Plasma homocystein levels in heterozygous and homozygous KO mice were 1.6- and 10-fold higher than wild type littermates.
