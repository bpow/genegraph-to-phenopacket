Numerous variants have been reported in TSC1 in relation to tuberous sclerosis complex, including missense, nonsense, indels and small deletions that result in frameshift, as well as intragenic deletions (Hasbani and Crino, 2018 PMID: 29478616). The  TSC1 database in LOVD (http://chromium.lovd.nl/LOVD2/TSC/home.php?select_db=TSC1) shows a total of  928 unique variants associated with TSC. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation and experimental data. This gene-disease relationship has been studied for 20 years, therefore a significant amount of case-level data and segregation is available, however the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. This gene-disease relationship is supported by functional studies including expression and protein interaction, as well as animal models and rescue experiments, thus the maximum score for experimental evidence (6 points) has been reached.\n\nTP53 has been associated with several disease entities and/or phenotypes through germline inheritance, including:\n(1) Tuberous sclerosis-1 (MIM:191100) and (2) Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (MIM:606690)\n\nEvidence in the literature supports that Lymphangioleiomyomatosis occurs in individuals with TSC and mutations in TSC1. Additionally, a sporadic form of Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (S-LAM) can occur through by the two hit model, in which the wildtype allele of TSC1 incurs loss of heterozygosity (LOH) specifically in the lung (Murphy et al., 2017 PMID:  28643793). Of note, the involvement of TSC1 in Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (sporadic) is rare, and the TSC2 gene is more frequently shown to have a relationship with S-LAM. Hamartin, the protein product of the TSC1 gene, is a known tumor suppressor, therefore loss of function results in uncontrolled cell proliferation. Consistent with this model the molecular mechanism for TSC1 is loss of function, as indicated by deletion and nonsense variation, as well as biochemical loss of tumor suppressor activity (Hasbani and Crino, 2018 PMID: 29478616). \n\nPer the criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we have found no difference in molecular mechanism, inheritance pattern, or phenotypic expressivity, and therefore Lymphangioleiomyomatosis due to germline mutations in TSC1 alone that occur in TSC patients has been lumped into the disease entity, Tuberous sclerosis complex. However, the somatically occurring Lymphangioleiomyomatosis due to one (or two) somatic mutations in TSC1 is not covered under the current Gene Disease Validity Classification matrix, asit is restricted to germline inheritance, therefore no evidence for somatic mutations in TSC1 were included in the current curation. \n\nIn summary, TSC1 is DEFINITIVELY associated with autosomal dominant tuberous sclerosis complex. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d9430a4b-c7dd-4ac4-89ef-f88010f782e0","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/61b07bb0-1385-4344-8b6c-571f6a271000","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/61b07bb0-1385-4344-8b6c-571f6a271000_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10026","date":"2019-01-23T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/61b07bb0-1385-4344-8b6c-571f6a271000_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10026","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/61b07bb0-1385-4344-8b6c-571f6a271000_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/61b07bb0-1385-4344-8b6c-571f6a271000_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a0c44bb6-1bba-49d1-ac8c-55cce8ff203f","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/68b757a1-5bee-48ae-906d-128835d08594","type":"Finding","dc:description":"The development of renal carcinomas in the TSC1^+/- mice validates that these mice recapitulate the development of kidney tumors as observed in humans with tuberous sclerosis.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15888477","rdfs:label":"TSC1-beta gal mouse model","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/dcb6f9b0-ae84-4a12-a0c1-052f3cd0e858","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Because this is a rescue in an animal model, the default score is 2 points.","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c9ea4b30-fe92-4ef2-b698-175abd431a56","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Neurons expressing the TSC1-WT-2A-mCherry had reduced neuronal soma size, equivalent to control mCherry expressing cells, and normal phosphorylation levels of S6.
