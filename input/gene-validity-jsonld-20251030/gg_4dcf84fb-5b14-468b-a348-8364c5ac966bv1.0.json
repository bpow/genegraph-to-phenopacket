Two unique frameshift variants that have been reported in one proband in one publication are included in this curation. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by a biochemical function study (Koike et al, PMID: 19473117) and multiple animal models (PMIDs: 21901110, 27405802, 3015814). After discussion with the expert panel, although the point total is consistent with Moderate, since only one clinical case has been reported, this gene-disease relationship has been downgraded to Limited. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation GCEP on the meeting date April 3, 2025 (SOP Version 11).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4dcf84fb-5b14-468b-a348-8364c5ac966b","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/72f70309-971d-4adf-8409-8aab95aad5e6","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/72f70309-971d-4adf-8409-8aab95aad5e6_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10135","date":"2025-04-11T20:36:41.155Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/72f70309-971d-4adf-8409-8aab95aad5e6_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10135","date":"2025-04-03T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"Only one clinical case has been reported, therefore this classification was downgraded to Limited.","curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/72f70309-971d-4adf-8409-8aab95aad5e6_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/72f70309-971d-4adf-8409-8aab95aad5e6_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/59021218-35bf-4d57-9b7f-120f0269aa40","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Reducing due to conditional knockout in specific tissue.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d76b04d9-cd24-49f7-9a7f-fdf905411cba","type":"Finding","dc:description":"The skeletal abnormalities are quite similar to what is observed in humans.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27405802","rdfs:label":"Ma Mouse Model","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4b124679-260a-459e-9f80-d9b0719df621","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Phenotype was focused on craniofacial abnormalities and did not completely recapitulate the human phenotype, but the rescue adds additional support to this model.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4fdd656f-5ad3-4b2f-9f09-0091526dfc8a","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Craniofacial abnormalities are similar to what has been observed in humans.
