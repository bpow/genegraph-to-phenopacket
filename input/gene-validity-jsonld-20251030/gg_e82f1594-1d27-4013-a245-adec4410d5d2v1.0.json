NDUFS3 was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Leigh syndrome spectrum in 2004 (Benit et al., PMID 14729820). Several variants have been reported in ClinVar, but mostly with limited evidence of pathogenicity. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data (PMIDs 14729820, 22200994) to reach a case-level evidence score of 3.5 points. This gene-disease association is further supported by the function of the gene product, complex I alterations in cell lines, expression studies, and animal models reaching an experimental score of 5.5 points. The mechanism for disease is complex I deficiency.  In summary, NDUFS3 is moderately associated with autosomal recessive Leigh syndrome spectrum. This classification was approved by the NICHD U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on June 10, 2019 (SOP Version 6).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e82f1594-1d27-4013-a245-adec4410d5d2","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4ae2af25-4fc1-48c3-a289-fae04977b192","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4ae2af25-4fc1-48c3-a289-fae04977b192_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4ae2af25-4fc1-48c3-a289-fae04977b192_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2019-06-20T16:25:02.779Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4ae2af25-4fc1-48c3-a289-fae04977b192_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7739b144-725d-43a0-8a8f-a882efcca395_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c8474290-41b3-45be-a4e4-a16de56dad6a","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22200994","rdfs:label":"Index
