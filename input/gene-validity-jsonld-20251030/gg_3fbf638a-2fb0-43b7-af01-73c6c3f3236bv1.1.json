Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in molecular mechanism, inheritance pattern, and phenotypic variability. Therefore, atrioventricular septal defect and congenital heart disease have been lumped into one disease entity. Two unique variants, a missense and a CNV, have been reported in two probands in two publications (PMIDs: 27058611, 31552105). However, the missense variant had a high minor allele frequency (> 0.00001) in gnomAD v2.1.1 and a very low REVEL score, and was, therefore, not scored. The gene-disease relationship is supported by a knockout mouse model and functional alteration data (PMIDs: 12098698, 16222293, 16794040). Although there is sufficient experimental evidence, the genetic evidence is not convincing enough to support the relationship. In summary, the evidence supporting the relationship between *ATE1* and autosomal recessive congenital heart diseases has been disputed, and no valid evidence remains to support the claim. More evidence is needed to either support or entirely refute the role *ATE1* plays in this disease. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Congenital Heart Disease GCEP on the meeting date 8/14/2023 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3fbf638a-2fb0-43b7-af01-73c6c3f3236b","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/091bbd85-831a-4628-92f4-b2487d837eb6","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","changes":{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/091bbd85-831a-4628-92f4-b2487d837eb6_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10130","date":"2023-08-14T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/091bbd85-831a-4628-92f4-b2487d837eb6_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10130","date":"2023-09-18T17:39:58.685Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"The curation includes only one proband with a variant that has a high minor allele frequency.

In vivo oxidation of N-terminal cysteine, before its arginylation, requires nitric oxide, and reconstituted this process in vitro as well. The levels of regulatory proteins bearing N-terminal cysteine, such as RGS4, RGS5, and RGS16, were greatly increased in mouse Ate1-null embryos, which lack arginylation. Stabilization of these proteins, the first physiologic substrates of mammalian N-end rule pathway, may underlie cardiovascular defects in Ate1-null embryos. ","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16222293","rdfs:label":"Hu functional alteration "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/091bbd85-831a-4628-92f4-b2487d837eb6_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6efd1394-ba97-47f2-a6f6-f2528eda6a8a","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e1b2c14a-9600-4bcb-a993-6b52c779aa77","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Ate1 -/- embryos died with defects in heart development.
