This association was made using case-level data. At least 8 missense variants have been reported in humans. GJB6 was first associated with this disease in humans as early as 2000 (Lemartine et al.​). Association is seen in at least 13 probands in 8 publications (11017065, 23219093, 11874494, 18717672, 27137747, 25808784, 19416251, 26620415). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 65 additional family members. The GJB6 and autosomal dominant Clouston syndrome association is supported by expression studies. Of note, this gene has also been implicated in nonsyndromic hearing loss. Autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss has been​ assessed separately. There was not enough evidence to split out and curate for autosomal dominant nonsyndromic hearing loss, however it should be noted this curation did not score any AD nonsyndromic hearing loss cases. Expert review upgraded the GJB6-Clouston syndrome association to Definitive. In summary, GJB6 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant Clouston syndrome. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hearing Loss Working Group on 4/17/18.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e055960a-a364-4c03-85ff-30f93730c380","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ff18d307-80a8-44b8-8b1a-e26e8a7d912a","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ff18d307-80a8-44b8-8b1a-e26e8a7d912a_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2018-04-17T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ff18d307-80a8-44b8-8b1a-e26e8a7d912a_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"Expert review upgraded the GJB6-Clouson syndrome association to Definitive after reviewing the available evidence.","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ff18d307-80a8-44b8-8b1a-e26e8a7d912a_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ff18d307-80a8-44b8-8b1a-e26e8a7d912a_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/70a2c39d-07ab-4c89-8fee-585d896e94d7","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Upgraded because expression was shown in multiple tissues","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/68af6ad5-22e9-4230-857e-b6cb6b6c10e7","type":"Finding","dc:description":"GJB6 is expressed in human hair follicles, nails, and palmoplantar epidermis","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23219093","rdfs:label":"Fujimoto Expression","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/023eb9de-db2a-4e43-8ffb-ba782c85e9b1","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Upgraded for multiple expression experiments","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ac9562e0-5407-41cd-ac58-75bf483171e6","type":"Finding","dc:description":"-T5M and G59R, reported in nonsyndromic HL  and HL with PPK, respectively, did not change protein expression levels while two HED variants, V37E and A88V reduced expression. \n-T5M did not affect localization of Cx30 nor gap junction formation according to IF labeling.
