Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data. \n\nFour variants (missense, nonsense, frameshift) that have been reported in four probands in four publications (PMIDs: 25205112, 30018422, 30237576, 36561016) are included in this curation. Patients with recessive *SLC9A1* variants have mainly been reported to exhibit early-onset cerebellar ataxia, seizures, cerebral atrophy and variable hearing loss (PMID: 25205112, 30018422, 36561016). Recently Pellerin, Ceravolo, and colleagues reported individuals from consanguineous families carrying recessive *SLC9A1* variants presenting with amelogenesis imperfecta in addition to early-onset cerebellar ataxia associated with cerebellar atrophy, developmental delay, and variable sensorineural hearing loss (Journal of the Neurological Sciences, Volume 455, 121930).  \n\nThis gene-disease relationship is supported by animal model and expression studies. *SLC9A1* is shown to be ubiquitously expressed in various tissues throughout the body (PMID: 23715323, dbGaP Accession phs000424.v10.p2). Homozygous SLC9A1 null mutant mice models showed reduced postnatal growth, ataxia, and epileptic-like seizures without cerebellar atrophy (PMID: 10199808). \n\nIn summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Cerebellar Ataxia GCEP on the meeting date July 9th, 2025 (SOP Version 11).\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5432cae2-4f84-4184-9bdc-16695efdb358","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e1333b89-1442-460f-9fab-11e7b4322117","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e1333b89-1442-460f-9fab-11e7b4322117_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10155","date":"2025-07-17T10:56:00.857Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e1333b89-1442-460f-9fab-11e7b4322117_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10155","date":"2025-07-09T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e1333b89-1442-460f-9fab-11e7b4322117_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f0f0fb93-ca19-48b1-9b50-e88908a0f490_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f7488cbc-2ed3-477c-9794-de2eaea7a7d7","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Score reduced.
