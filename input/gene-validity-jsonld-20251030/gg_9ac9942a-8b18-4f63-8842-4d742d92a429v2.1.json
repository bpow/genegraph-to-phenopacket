The clinical presentation varies, but the condition is characterized by recurrent vomiting, lethargy, seizures, metabolic acidosis, and developmental delay. Patients are responsive to treatment with Vitamin B12 (Hörster, et al, 2007,  PMID: 17597648). Bilallelic variants in MMAA were first reported in humans with methylmalonic academia (MMA) in 2002 (Dobson et al, PMID 12438653). Since then, about 60 different variants in MMAA have been published (Plessl et al, 2017, PMID 28497574), including p.Arg145Ter which accounts for about 43% of disease-causing variants (Lerner-Ellis et al, 2004, PMID 15523652). \nEvidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level and experimental data. Seven unique variants (nonsense, frameshift, missense) from 8 probands from 4 publications were curated (Lerner-Ellis et al, 2004, PMID 15523652; Keyfi et al, 2016, PMID 28536607; Plessl et al, 2017, PMID 28497574; Lin et al, 2018, PMID 29996803). Further evidence is available in the literature but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached.\nThe gene-disease relationship is supported by the biochemical function of MMAA (Takahashi-Iñiguez et al, 2017, PMID 28943303), it’s physical interaction with methylmalonyl CoA mutase (MUT) which is encoded by another gene involved in methylmalonic acidemia (Froese et al, 2010), and functional alteration studies (Plessl et al, 2017, PMID 28497574).\nIn summary, MMAA is definitively associated with methylmalonic aciduria, cblA type. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9ac9942a-8b18-4f63-8842-4d742d92a429","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5b81bb9e-5f71-47bf-b187-5eef83d91d57","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":[{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"},{"id":"cg:classificationChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5b81bb9e-5f71-47bf-b187-5eef83d91d57_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10011","date":"2022-07-13T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10084","role":"SecondaryContributor"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5b81bb9e-5f71-47bf-b187-5eef83d91d57_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10011","date":"2022-07-13T17:19:31.587Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5b81bb9e-5f71-47bf-b187-5eef83d91d57_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5b81bb9e-5f71-47bf-b187-5eef83d91d57_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/27c9847e-605a-42bc-9a78-3841a6a4c259","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/dacfecf9-3926-4b70-a055-bfe1dca2b8c6","type":"Finding","dc:description":"On analytical size-exclusion chromatography, human MUT and human MMAA migrated at 196 kDa and 78 kDa, respectively, consistent with homodimeric assembly in each case.

In addition, a progressive loss of MCM activity had been observed during catalysis. A possible accessory function for MMAA, that would impact the activity of MCM, was suggested. MMAA-GTP was noted to protect MCM against loss of activity, and MMAA-GTP hydrolysis restored activity from the inactive enzyme (see introduction of this paper for references). This study presents evidence for the oxidative inactivation of AdoCbl of MCM during catalysis, and showed that the presence of human MMAA prevents formation of hydroxocobalamin (inactive form). Human MMAA was shown to promote the replacement of hydroxocobalamin (inactive form of cofactor) by AdoCbl (active form) in the presence of GTP, thereby restoring the activity of MCM. \nThis function is consistent with the biochemical findings in patients with biallelic loss of function variants in MMAA because, without MMAA function, MCM (mut) would be unable to perform it's function of the isomerization of methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA, thus resulting in methylmalonic acidemia.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28943303","rdfs:label":"MMAA impact on MCM function","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5b81bb9e-5f71-47bf-b187-5eef83d91d57_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5ac1892e-eb0f-446b-9613-ede9bc5db08c","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The score is increased based on the number of missense variants analyzed (n=22), and the multiple studies performed showing alteration in various processes required for MMAA to function correctly.","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5d151523-3134-4bf0-b382-d2fc3efe5ee1","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"22 missense variants were identified in patients with MMA, CblA type, as part of this and previous studies. Seven of these missense variants resulted in severe instability of the recombinant protein when it was expressed in HEK293 cells and E.coli. The remaining 15 variants were expressed in E.coli and purified. The following functional alterations were noted:\n1) Normally, the chaperone/gating function of MMAA depends on GTP‐binding and GTPase activity. Ligand binding, with GDP and GMPPNP (non‐hydrolysable analogue of GTP), showed that all variants resulted in increased Tm, similar to wild type protein, except for p.Asp292Val, indicating that Asp292 is involved in GDP binding. Lys290 was also identified as a residue directly involved in nucleotide binding based on the crystal structures of human MMAA and bacterial MeaB. A double mutant, p.Lys290Ala + Asp292Ala, showed severely reduced nucleotide binding and impaired protein stabilization. \n2) Wild type MMAA has low intrinsic GTPase activity, but this is highly stimulated by incubation with MUT. All variants had similar intrinsic GTPase activity to wild type.\n3) Analytical size‐exclusion chromatography was done to assess physical interaction between MMAA and MUT. Six of nine mutants retained the ability to physically interact with MUT, although to a lesser extent than wild type. The other nine variants, including the four with the lowest GTPase activity stimulation (p.Arg98Gly, p.Gly188Arg, p.Gly218Glu, p.Thr243Asn), produced no detectable interaction peak.\n4) Normally, MMAA is involved in the transfer of AdoCbl to for MMAB to MUT. The release of AdoCbl from MMAB was analyzed. In mutants unable to physically interact with MUT, Kd values were similar to those in the absence of MMAA. Mutants still able to interact with MUT showed intermediate Kd values compared to the absence or presence of MMAA wild type.
