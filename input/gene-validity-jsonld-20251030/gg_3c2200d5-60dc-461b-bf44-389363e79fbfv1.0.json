UNC13A was first reported in association with congenital nervous system disorder by Engel et al. (2016), who described a proband with a homozygous stop-gained variant presenting with microcephaly, cortical hyperexcitability, and myasthenia (PMID 27648472). Based on the limited number of reported cases, a distinct mode of inheritance, mechanism of disease, and phenotypic spectrum have not been determined; for this reason, the gene was curated for the broad term congenital nervous system disorder, undetermined inheritance mode. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. At least three variants including missense and stop-gained variants have been reported in association with a neurodevelopmental syndrome characterized by variable features of developmental delay, seizures, microcephaly, and myopathy/movement disorders (PMIDs: 27648472, 28192369, 28771251). These variants were all considered and totaled 3 points, but can't be given points in the GCI due to the unknown MOI. Biallelic loss of function has been associated with developmental delay, microcephaly, cortical hyperexcitability, hypotonia, and myopathy, whereas heterozygous gain of function has been associated with hyperkinesia, developmental delay, and autism. This gene-disease association is supported by animal models, expression studies, and in vitro functional assays. Munc13-1 is highly expressed in the brain and at the neuromuscular junction, where it localizes to presynaptic terminals and plays a critical role in synaptic transmission by regulating release site assembly, synaptic vesicle priming, activity-dependent refilling of the readily releasable vesicle pool, calcium channel proximity, and short-term synaptic plasticity (PMIDs: 17167095, 30690332). In vivo and in vitro experiments have demonstrated that variation in the UNC13A gene can alter various properties of neuronal and neuromuscular synaptic transmission and lead to muscle weakness, respiratory insufficiency, and perinatal lethality (PMIDs: 10440375, 11792326, 27648472, 28192369). In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Syndromic Disorders GCEP on the meeting date October 15th, 2021 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3c2200d5-60dc-461b-bf44-389363e79fbf","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8cbf5d81-6724-47ab-900c-2adef7095431","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"NoKnownDiseaseRelationship","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8cbf5d81-6724-47ab-900c-2adef7095431_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10060","date":"2024-10-10T18:34:51.595Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8cbf5d81-6724-47ab-900c-2adef7095431_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10060","date":"2021-10-17T04:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"Because an inheritance pattern was not specified, genetic evidence could not be formally scored.

Whole-cell patch-clamp analysis revealed a marked phenotypical change in Munc13-1-deficient cultures. Excitatory post-synaptic currents (EPSCs) in mutant cells were reduced by more than 90%, whereas inhibitory currents (IPSCs) were unaffected (Fig. 1 a, b, c). This was not due to a change in the density of voltage-gated conductances (data not shown) or changes in calcium influx (Fig. 1 d, e). The observed specific reduction in glutamatergic transmission was not due to loss of synapses, as the density of total synaptic contacts (not shown) and the density of glutamatergic synapses were not altered by the mutation (Fig. 1f). Additional experiments ruled out a contribution of postsynaptic glutamate receptor sensitivity but suggested the deficits in glutamatergic synaptic transmission result from a decrease in the size of the readily releasable pool (RRP) of vesicles (Fig. 2). Experiments designed to assay functionally silent excitatory synapses using NMDA receptor blockade suggested that in KO neurons, at least 70% of all synapses do not release neurotransmitter under experimental stimulation; however, a subset of synapses functioned independently of Munc13-1 (Fig. 3). The ultrastructure of Munc13-1-deficient synapses was very similar to that of wild-type controls (Fig. 4) despite the reduction in the RRP, suggesting a deficit in fusion competence rather than vesicle docking.
