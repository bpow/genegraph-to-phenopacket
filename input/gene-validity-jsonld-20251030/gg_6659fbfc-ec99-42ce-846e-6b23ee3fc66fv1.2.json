Celestino-Soper et al. (2011, PMID: 21865298) identified a deletion of exon 2 of *TMLHE* resulting in enzyme deficiency in a male with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Subsequently, Celestino-Soper et al. (2012, PMID: 22566635) reported a total of 16 male ASD probands, 6 affected male siblings, and 24 healthy adult males with deletions of exon 2, indicating that this is a relatively common variant. The frequency of TMLHE deficiency in probands from simplex autism families (9 in 2,904 or 1 in 323) was not increased compared to control males (24 in 8,787 or 1 in 366). In agreement with these findings, *TMLHE* is not constrained for truncating variants (pLI = 0 in gnomAD v2.1.1). Therefore, these deletions were not scored. Three sequence variants resulting in TMLHE deficiency (nonsense, frameshift, and missense) have been reported in males with ASD (PMID: 23092983, 25943046). These variants were also not scored given the lack of evidence regarding their implication in ASD. \n\nNo experimental evidence was applicable to the relationship between *TMLHE* and autism. Reduced Tmlhe expression caused diminished neural stem cell pools in the mouse embryonic neocortex and carnitine supplementation rescued this phenotype (PMID: 26832401). In the absence of human genetic evidence linking *TMLHE* to autism, this experimental evidence was not scored. In summary, the genetic evidence reported thus far does not provide convincing evidence to support a role for *TMLHE* in ASD, so this gene-disease relationship was classified as disputed. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability/Autism GCEP on the meeting date March 2, 2021 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6659fbfc-ec99-42ce-846e-6b23ee3fc66f","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7a780ea6-ad4e-417a-a596-27188e327aad","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"NoKnownDiseaseRelationship","changes":[{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},{"id":"cg:classificationChange"},{"id":"cg:newEvidence"},{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7a780ea6-ad4e-417a-a596-27188e327aad_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2022-09-30T20:17:45.422Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7a780ea6-ad4e-417a-a596-27188e327aad_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2021-03-02T05:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"The authors identified a total of 16 male autism probands, 6 affected male sibs of probands, and 24 healthy adult males with deletions of exon 2, indicating that this is a relatively common variant.
