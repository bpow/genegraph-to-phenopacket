{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5821b659-28c1-4c4f-acba-30a667614c17v1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"The relationship between MT-CO3 and Leigh syndrome spectrum was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of May 24, 2021. The MT-CO3 gene encodes cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV) subunit 3. Defects of this protein lead to complex IV deficiency.\n\nThe first and only report of maternally inherited Leigh syndrome spectrum related to the MT-CO3 gene was in 2000 (PMID: 11063732). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included one variant (m.9537dupC) in one case from one publication (PMID: 11063732). Other variants in this gene have been related to other mitochondrial diseases outside the scope of this curation. Segregation information is scored as case level evidence according to the criteria established by the Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel. Loss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease association is also supported by known protein interaction, expression, and functional alterations in patient cells (PMIDs: 27977873, 25613900, 11063732). \n\nIn summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on May 24, 2021 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5821b659-28c1-4c4f-acba-30a667614c17","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/996428ee-5af2-458b-afb7-6e29348c585a","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/996428ee-5af2-458b-afb7-6e29348c585a_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2021-06-28T14:47:16.059Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/996428ee-5af2-458b-afb7-6e29348c585a_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2021-06-28T14:47:26.514Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"Only one case with LSS, must downgrade to limited until more cases are reported","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/996428ee-5af2-458b-afb7-6e29348c585a_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/996428ee-5af2-458b-afb7-6e29348c585a_ad_dn_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2b7f39d8-6112-4507-8c68-41ff1ba98c27_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"0.5 points for de novo + 0.5 points for egregation (virtually homoplasmic in muscle, fibroblasts, lymphocytes, oral epithelial cells, urine epithelial cells from patient; absent in lymphocytes of healthy brother and MGM; absent in lymphocyte hair, oral epithelial of mother\n\n2 points for additional cybrid testing (fused patient cytoplasts with rho0 cells; collected 20 clones homoplasmic for mutant _one clone is cy7 and this was used for studies - homoplasmic mutant (0.5 points for high heteroplasmy in cybrids); mutant cybrids were COX deficient like patient fibroblasts (biochemical deficiency in cybrid - 1point and biochemical deficiency in patient cell line 0.5 points); COX activity restored when HeLa cytoplasts fused with patient rhoO derivative","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6d5b5e37-2340-4828-8cfc-67389df5f767","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11063732","rdfs:label":"Case","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":4,"phenotypeFreeText":"symmetric necrotic lesions of basal ganglia (putamina), consistent with LS per Rahman et al 1996 paper\nMild disease course, mild ID, severe lactic acidosis\n\nabsence of histochemical reaction to COX in muscle and ; other RC enzymes and CS were normal","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2b7f39d8-6112-4507-8c68-41ff1ba98c27_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11063732","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/30173d92-d563-4ebb-86ef-2e20675ac38a","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"m.9537dupC","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA120602"}},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"none"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADDeNovoCriteria","strengthScore":3}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalDominantDeNovoVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":3}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":3},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/996428ee-5af2-458b-afb7-6e29348c585a_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/996428ee-5af2-458b-afb7-6e29348c585a_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3a006e79-3003-434f-81ca-f3fcff808424","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Functional validation done in cells from patient with LSS","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/932f1d96-7c19-499b-acb0-638754b01d6c","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Western blot/blue native gel electrophoresis done on patient fibroblasts, cybrids (generated from patient fibroblasts and rho-0 osteosarcoma cells), and HeLa cells.
