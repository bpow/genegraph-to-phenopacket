Previously, only 1 missense variant has been reported in an individual that presented with HCM and long QTc (LQTS) (PMID: 24183960). This individual also carried variants in two other genes associated with HCM. The re-curation of *KCNQ1* presented 1 missense variant (c1781G>A, p.(Arg594Gln)  in an individual with HCM and long QTc intervals (Cava et al., 2021 PMID: 33777698). This individual also carries a variant in *TNNI3* (c.592C>G, p.Leu198Val). This variant in *TNNI3* is considered likely pathogenic and segregated in individuals in the family presenting with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Variants in *KCNQ1* have been shown to be pathogenic in individuals and families with Long QT. The current ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework is for Mendelian inheritance and does not support classifications for disease in which multiple genes may be contributory. At this time there is no clinical or experimental evidence to support association of *KCNQ1* to HCM pathogenicity. \n\nThis curation was previously published by the Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy GCEP in 2017 with a classification of No Known Disease Relationship. At this time, during recuration, the relationship of KCNQ1 with autosomal dominant hypertrophic cardiomyopathy has now been classified as DISPUTED  by the Hereditary Cardiovascular Diseases GCEP as of April 13, 2022.
