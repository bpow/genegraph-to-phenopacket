At least 19 unique variants (e.g. missense, in-frame indel, nonsense, frameshift, etc) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and some experimental data.\nVariants in this gene have been reported in at least 26 probands in six publications (PMIDs: 21785126, 26915364, 30740739, 26827111, 27604308, 21841779). All of these probands show evidence of the biochemical abnormalities characteristic of this disorder, however many of them do not demonstrate any additional phenotypic abnormalities. Additionally, many of these variants have high population frequencies that would not befit a deleterious function when affected as well as a high recorded pLOF (https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/gene/ENSG00000176715). As such, this disorder has been asserted to be a benign metabolic phenotype in the literature (PMIDs: 21841779, 30740739). Functional studies into the effects of these variants in vitro or to determine any residual enzyme activity have not yet been performed.\nThe mechanism for disease is biallelic loss of function, with disruption of the encoded mitochondrial malonyl-CoA and methylmalonyl-CoA synthetase causing a backup in intramitochondrial fatty acid synthesis and resulting buildup of malonic and methylmalonic acid in urine and tissues. \nThis gene-disease association is supported by functional studies performed on patient tissue, with MMA production significantly lowered in patient fibroblasts compared to controls and the expression of WT ACSF3 cDNA, but not GFP, rescuing the metabolic phenotype and returning the production levels to near the controls. A natural canine model exhibiting the deficency also exists with homozygous variants in this gene, although there are other unexplained severe neurological symptoms in the line as well.\nIn summary, ACSF3 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive combined malonic and methylmalonic acidemia (CMAMMA). Although more functional data examining the residual activity of variants and more experimental data could be acquired, the evidence currently provided is sufficent and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2362862a-e7a6-4611-a15b-e73ac23f9bff","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b215e20c-7781-49a0-b473-9219cb07e0b9","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b215e20c-7781-49a0-b473-9219cb07e0b9_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10011","date":"2020-11-03T19:48:56.477Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b215e20c-7781-49a0-b473-9219cb07e0b9_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10011","date":"2020-10-09T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b215e20c-7781-49a0-b473-9219cb07e0b9_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/adaa2662-61d8-417a-baa7-95f456315543_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Compound heterozygous missense variants with no variant-level evidence yields decreased points.","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b49b171c-f0be-429e-a325-9275ef729fe7","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26915364","rdfs:label":"SVDVA","ageType":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/","ageUnit":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/","detectionMethod":"Diagnostic exome sequencing was performed and identified compound heterozygous missense mutations in ACSF3.","phenotypeFreeText":"Diffusely increased T2 signal in the white matter, Malonic acidemia/uria","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001944","obo:HP_0002329","obo:HP_0001269","obo:HP_0000969","obo:HP_0002013"],"previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"Both patients improved clinically after treatment with lorazepram; MMA concentrations were consistently elevated in urine as well as plasma; The range of urine MA excretion was 15–201 and 13–226 μmol/mmol creatinine in patient A and patient B, respectively; Control values vailable in Fig 2 and 3; Treated with acyclovir, methylprednisolone, and haloperidol without clear clinical benefits; Free carnitine, acylcarnitines (including C3DC-carnitine and C4DC-carnitine), amino acids, and total homocysteine were normal","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/adaa2662-61d8-417a-baa7-95f456315543_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26915364","allele":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/757d30e5-b19e-4327-8825-924c0d6730ab","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001243279.3(ACSF3):c.311A>T (p.Asn104Ile)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA397133842"}},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/476d1c8f-e23b-40a0-be06-a17c5ecda2aa","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001243279.3(ACSF3):c.1075G>A (p.Glu359Lys)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA129707"}}],"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"}}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.25},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d15ecae5-34ca-4726-8035-2d48dc4a04d6_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"A homozygous missense variant without variant-level evidence yields minimum points.","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8240e649-1b50-40dc-8631-38989857eeb6","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21841779","rdfs:label":"SL6","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":66,"detectionMethod":"DNA was isolated from subjects via whole blood.

Since this metabolic pathway is disrupted, the substrates are unable to be processed and each accumulate in tissues or in the urine as demonstrated with every human proband with CMAMMA. Unlike other methylmalonic acidurias, such as those caused by MMAA, the MMA/MA ratio is still typical to what you would see in a control proband. Other potentially harmful phenotypes have been observed in probands with CMAMMA, however the biochemical abnormality is the only phenotype linking each proband known.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21846720","rdfs:label":"ACSF3 as a Malonate/Methylmalonate Synthetase","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":5}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":1425,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria7","strengthScore":12.4,"subject":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8YXmGp7juWc","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0013661","gene":"hgnc:27288","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","websiteLegacyID":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/assertion_b215e20c-7781-49a0-b473-9219cb07e0b9-","@context":{"@vocab":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"},"curationReasons":{"@type":"@vocab","@container":"@set"},"GCISnapshot":{"@type":"@id"},"dc:isVersionOf":{"@type":"@id"},"websiteLegacyID":{"@type":"@id"}}}
