SLC17A5 encodes solute carrier family 17 member 5 (also known as sialin), a lysosomal membrane transporter protein that exports sialic acid (the majority of which is N-acetylneuraminic acid, Neu5Ac) and other acidic hexoses from lysosomes (PMID: 2010546). Among patients with free sialic acid storage disease, deficient SLC17A5 function results in impaired sialic acid export from lysosomes and lysosomal accumulation of sialic acid (PMID: 15557321), leading to a spectrum of clinical manifestations including urinary excretion of free sialic acid, neurological and developmental symptoms with severity ranging from the milder phenotype, Salla disease (SD), to the most severe phenotype, infantile free sialic acid storage disease (ISSD) (as reviewed in PMID: 20301643, 33862140).\n\nLumping and splitting: Variants in *SLC17A5* have been reported in individuals with Salla disease (MIM# 604369) and Sialic acid storage disorder, infantile (MIM# 269920). Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in the molecular mechanism or inheritance pattern for these conditions. Salla disease and Sialic acis storage disorder, infantile represent a clinical continuum (PMIDs: 20301643, 33862140). Therefore, the two entities have been lumped as free sialic acid storage disease.\n\nThe disease mechanism for free SASD is loss of function. ISSD was first reported by Tondeur et al. in 1982 (PMID: 7151835); first report of biallelic variants in SLC17A5 among ISSD patients by Verheijen in 1999 (PMID: 10581036). Both case-level (genetic) and experimental evidence support the relationship between SLC17A5 and ISSD. Reported causal variants include missense, nonsense, frameshift, and splice-altering variants (PMID: 15172005, PMID: 23900835, PMID: 15805149, PMID: 10581036). In total, ten variants from seven probands in four publications were curated. Although there is additional published case-level evidence available, the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has already been reached. \n\nExperimental evidence (4 points total) for the relationship between SLC17A5 and free SASD includes: the biochemical function of the gene product (solute carrier family 17 member 5) being consistent with the clinical and biochemical findings identified in individuals with ISSD (PMID: 2010546, PMID: 15557321, PMID: 33862140; PMID: 10581036) and the biochemical and clinical features of *SLC17A5* knockout mice (PMID: 28189729). \n\nIn sum, *SLC17A5* is definitively associated with free SASD. The association has been repeatedly demonstrated in both clinical and research settings, and has been upheld over time.

solute carrier family 17 member 5 (also known as sialin), a lysosomal membrane transporter protein that exports sialic acid (the majority of which is N-acetylneuraminic acid, Neu5Ac) and other acidic hexoses from lysosomes (PMID: 2010546). Among patients with infantile sialic acid storage disease (ISSD), deficient SLC17A5 function results in impaired sialic acid export from lysosomes and lysosomal accumulation of sialic acid (PMID: 15557321), leading to disease manifestations including urinary excretion of free sialic acid, intrauterine hydrops, failure to thrive, global developmental delay, coarse facial features, hepatosplenomegaly, cardiomegaly, nephrosis, and early demise (under 2 years of age) (as reviewed in PMID: 33862140). Thus, the function of SLC17A5 as a lysosomal transport protein that exports sialic acid is consistent with the impaired sialic acid transport seen in ISSD patients.
