Two unique variants (heterozygous missense) that have been reported in one proband in one publication are included in this curation (PMID:  33006316). However, these variants were not scored due to a high minor allele frequency in gnomAD v.4.This gene-disease relationship is supported by an animal model (PMID: 26822476). No evidence for a causal role for *LRP2* in autosomal recessive congenital heart disease has been reported. Although this gene-disease relationship is supported by an animal model, no reports have directly implicated the gene in humans.This classification was approved by the ClinGen Congenital Heart Disease GCEP on the meeting date September 9th, 2024 (SOP Version 11).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/631cf239-bb4c-445b-a36c-dd5a2a876a30","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/291857b3-399a-42fa-86f7-d4077f97accd","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"NoKnownDiseaseRelationship","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/291857b3-399a-42fa-86f7-d4077f97accd_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10130","date":"2024-09-09T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/291857b3-399a-42fa-86f7-d4077f97accd_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10130","date":"2024-10-16T18:05:14.255Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/291857b3-399a-42fa-86f7-d4077f97accd_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/291857b3-399a-42fa-86f7-d4077f97accd_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/291857b3-399a-42fa-86f7-d4077f97accd_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e1c33e88-b368-42bb-bfd2-d27f219ab9aa","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b48de616-91d7-4219-9d18-3d23221fdf6f","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Similar congenital heart disease phenotypes and specifically that related to aortic arch anomalies  have been seen in a human report.
