Evidence of the association of this gene with DCM was re-evaluated using SOP v10 on 11/15/2024. As a result, the classification did not change. A summary of the information contributing to the classification of this gene at the time of re-evaluation is summarized herein. \n\nSylvius et al. (2001, PMID: 11085912) were the first to identify LAMA4 within the genetic locus associated with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Human genetic evidence supporting the relationship between LAMA4 and autosomal dominant DCM includes case-level reports. \n\nMarston et al. (2015, PMID: 26406308) identified a missense variant in LAMA4 classified as Likely Benign in a patient with DCM, no segregation data were available, and it was not scored. \n\nAdditionally, Abdallah and colleagues (2019, PMID: 30650640) described a pediatric case of infantile DCM that carried two variants: one in LAMA4 (inherited from the father, who had a normal heart evaluation) and one in MYH7 (inherited from the mother, who exhibited mild DCM). Consequently, there was insufficient evidence to conclude that the LAMA4 variant caused the DCM phenotype; it was more likely that the MYH7 variant was the contributing factor.\n\nKnoll and colleagues (2007, PMID: 17646580) identified three variants in LAMA4, which included two missense variants of unknown significance and one stop codon variant, in 3 DCM patients. Immunohistochemical analysis of myocardial biopsies revealed a significant loss of endothelial cells carrying the stop codon variant (p.R1073X). \n\nFindings from animal models also support this gene-disease association. Wang and colleagues (2006, PMID: 16204254) demonstrated that adult LAMA4 knockout mice exhibited a higher frequency of sudden death during noninvasive procedures, such as anesthesia induction. At 36–40 weeks of age, these mice showed a significant increase in left ventricular end-diastolic diameter and left ventricular end-systolic diameter. Over time, the mutant hearts displayed widening of the extravascular space, cardiomyocyte degeneration, and fibrosis.\nMore recently, Barati and colleagues (2021, PMID: 36317039) described a case of DCM in a 42-year-old woman and evaluated variants in different genes coding crucial proteins in cardiac muscle structure i.e LAMA4. However, no variants were reported to be scored.\n\nFinally, Shen and colleagues (2022, PMID: 35284542) investigated genetic variants in Chinese patients with sporadic dilated cardiomyopathy. However, most of variants were VUS, Likely Benign, Benign and Authors did not include high impact genes for DCM i.e. TTN and FLNC. Since, the presence of LP o P variants in these genes cannot be excluded, this study was not scored.\n\nIn summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. More evidence is needed to support the relationship of LAMA4 and AD DCM. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Dilated Cardiomyopathy Working Group on 11/15/2024 (SOP Version 10).
