Numerous variants have been reported in humans per ClinVar. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Summary of case-level and experimental data: 14.5 points. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 16 probands in 4 publications (PMIDS: 25604618, 31240149, 17905308,10767344, 9326940, 22156782, 9326939, 28681609). This gene-disease association is supported by animal models and in vitro functional assays. In summary, *PHYH* is definitively associated with autosomal recessive phytanoyl-CoA hydroxylase deficiency. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4f9607bf-4e7a-462c-b701-5e2af00568f4","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8c50f8ab-65d8-493d-a800-52af1fa13339","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8c50f8ab-65d8-493d-a800-52af1fa13339_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10049","date":"2020-02-07T05:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8c50f8ab-65d8-493d-a800-52af1fa13339_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10049","date":"2022-04-23T00:43:36.408Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8c50f8ab-65d8-493d-a800-52af1fa13339_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d104734a-2a58-4f6d-9886-b0d717ed8aa6_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a30cc053-c2f9-4372-9707-8d794e396d41","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"gnomAD
