Three unique variants (missense and frameshift) in three individuals with congenital heart disease that have been reported in three publications (PMIDs: 23665959,  28991257, 33084842) were included in this curation. No experimental evidence has been reported in the literature supporting this gene-disease relationship. In summary, there is limited evidence supporting the relationship between *KDM5A* and autosomal dominant congenital heart disease. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Congenital Heart Disease GCEP on the meeting date 1/8/2024 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3e3bd640-bb52-4f5b-b5c0-6bda1e7af653","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e3e727da-2ddf-418d-830d-b1da8850c93d","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e3e727da-2ddf-418d-830d-b1da8850c93d_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10130","date":"2024-01-08T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e3e727da-2ddf-418d-830d-b1da8850c93d_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10130","date":"2024-01-09T16:27:56.915Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e3e727da-2ddf-418d-830d-b1da8850c93d_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e3e727da-2ddf-418d-830d-b1da8850c93d_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c17dda42-fe91-4faa-8267-a2a24b5ab668","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c17dda42-fe91-4faa-8267-a2a24b5ab668_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33084842","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7e9e8024-35b1-414c-8c59-57a78eeb8888","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001042603.3(KDM5A):c.1119del (p.Phe373LeufsTer17)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA2571725677"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:AlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Heterozygous"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/48e3b297-28d4-4fcb-8289-a853b476ca75","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"MAF in gnomAD v4 was 0.000033 (2/60000 alleles in Admixed American) which is too common for CHD.
