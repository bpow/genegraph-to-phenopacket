PMID: 1401056). At least 84 variants (including many missense, nonsense and splicing defects, as well as deletions) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data.\n\nSummary of Case Level Data: 12 POINTS\nVariants in this gene have been reported in at least 16 probands in 5 publications (PMIDs: 22884142, 8318997, 7550234, 7942842, 8162054). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached.\n\nSummary of Experimental Evidence: 5 POINTS\nThe gene-disease association is supported by the biochemical function of FAH, which catalyzes the cleavage of fumarylacetoacetate to fumarate and acetoacetate (PMID: 7296877); its absence results in the accumulation of fumarylacetoacetate and maleylacetoacetate, which are alkylating agents presumed responsible for the liver damage observed in Tyrosinemia Type I. Expression of FAH occurs primarily in the liver (and to a lesser degree kidneys and adrenals), which is the primary organ system affected by Tyrosinemia I, and is absent or reduced in acute and chronic patients respectively (PMID: 2378356). Mouse models have been generated both by targeted disruption of FAH and ENU-induced mutation (PMIDs: 8253378, 1129059). Both of these mouse models have been rescued by a variety of methods, including adenoviral vectors to introduce the human FAH gene and CRISPR to correct the mouse gene (PMIDs: 9095403, 26829318).\n\nIn summary, FAH is definitively associated with autosomal recessive Tyrosinemia Type I. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7b41c3fc-d4ab-4da7-9892-4b61aee22941","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/39c50699-f422-4bae-89ac-af13ef7cb8cc","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":[{"id":"cg:sopChange"},{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/39c50699-f422-4bae-89ac-af13ef7cb8cc_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10011","date":"2020-06-29T17:41:49.440Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/39c50699-f422-4bae-89ac-af13ef7cb8cc_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10011","date":"2020-09-16T19:23:17.645Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/39c50699-f422-4bae-89ac-af13ef7cb8cc_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6a56b0a3-0a8d-4519-8a0e-e53857f45e80_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The c.1062+5G>A variant leads to aberrant splicing causing either insertion of a 105 base-pair fragment due to a cryptic splice site, or skipping of exon 12, or skipping of both exons 12 and 13.
