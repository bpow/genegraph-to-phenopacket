Two variants (missense variants that cause loss of function) that have been reported in two probands in two publications (PMIDs: 26676105, 26865696) are included in this curation. Variants associated with isolated dilated cardiomyopathy are excluded. The mechanism of pathogenicity is reported to be loss of function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence (mouse models, expression studies, biochemical functional evidence, and interaction evidence; PMIDs: 9171826, 9878849, 10675351, 11812799, 15576406, 26676105). In summary, there is moderate evidence supporting the relationship between *HAND2* and autosomal dominant structural congenital heart disease. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Congenital Heart Disease GCEP on the meeting date 7/17/2023 (SOP Version 9)","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/296638fd-61a1-4f65-bb5f-b884e76f100a","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/29254c37-49c2-4d29-918f-c106989eadba","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","changes":{"id":"cg:sopChange"},"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/29254c37-49c2-4d29-918f-c106989eadba_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10130","date":"2023-07-17T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/29254c37-49c2-4d29-918f-c106989eadba_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10130","date":"2024-01-08T17:06:08.461Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration","DiseaseNameUpdate"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/29254c37-49c2-4d29-918f-c106989eadba_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7feb3136-f228-4ddb-b75c-afb439ce928f","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"This is a missense variant scored as a null due to the functional study.
