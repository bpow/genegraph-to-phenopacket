For this curation, variants in FOXP1 have been reported in individuals with the following phenotypes: atrioventricular septal defect and hypoplastic left heart syndrome. Of note, this gene has also been implicated in intellectual developmental disorder with language impairment with or without autistic features (OMIM:613670) and congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT). These will be assessed separately. At least 3 variants (missense, deep intronic deletion, and a large deletion) have been reported in humans (23766104, 33084842). Evidence disputing this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data. Of the three variants reported, one is too frequent to cause disease, another is a deep intronic deletion with unknown functional consequence, and the third is a large deletion that encompasses microRNA hsa-miR-1284 and was inherited from an unaffected parent; therefore, none of the published genetic evidence was scorable. This gene-disease relationship is supported by animal models and expression studies (15342473). In summary, due to the lack of convincing genetic evidence, the evidence supporting the relationship between *FOXP1* and autosomal dominant congenital heart disease has been disputed and no valid evidence remains to support the claim. More evidence is needed to either support or entirely refute the role *FOXP1* plays in this disease. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Congenital Heart Disease GCEP on the meeting date December 11, 2023 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/82aed9d1-861b-45a6-92ce-cb78753b6b15","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e0d2a272-afc2-49df-aa73-0b2f82ce11d6","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"NoKnownDiseaseRelationship","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e0d2a272-afc2-49df-aa73-0b2f82ce11d6_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10130","date":"2023-12-11T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e0d2a272-afc2-49df-aa73-0b2f82ce11d6_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10130","date":"2024-02-20T15:43:49.722Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"Variants in FOXP1 were identified in four individuals with congenital heart disease.
