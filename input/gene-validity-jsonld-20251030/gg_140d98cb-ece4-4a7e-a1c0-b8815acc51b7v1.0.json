Although neuromyotonia was initially defined as a core feature of the disorder, reports of probands without neuromyotonia indicated incomplete penetrance for this phenotype. At least twelve unique variants (e.g. missense, nonsense, frameshift, etc.) have been reported in humans, with the most common pathogenic variant c.110G>C (p.Arg37Pro) being a founder variant observed mainly in patients of Slavic origin (PMID: 31848916). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data.\nVariants in this gene have been reported in at least ten probands in five publications (PMIDs: 26059562, 24105373, 25342199, 30001929, 22961002) and segregated with disease in four additional family members. These probands generally present with a primary axonal neuropathy characterized by gait impairment, progressive distal muscle weakness and atrophy, facial/foot deformities, and neuromyotonia. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism for disease is biallelic loss of function, as the mutant proteins are unable to fulfill HINT1's signalling role in the central and peripheral nervous system (PMID: 33404983).\nThis gene-disease association is supported by expression evidence, HINT1's biochemical function in the nervous system, and a series of functional studies performed on pathogenic variants in cell and animal models. Primary expression in the CNS and PNS indicates the crucial role that the protein fulfills, while loss of the sumolayse activity that HINT1 provides matches with the primary motor neuropathy phenotypes observed in probands (PMID: 31088288). Additionally, functional evaluation of all known pathogenic variants demonstrated a variety of altered functions including impaired thermal stability, disrupted dimer formation, and loss of interaction with SUMO1, CaM, and ICD Teneurin 1 (PMID: 33404983).\nIn summary, HINT1 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/140d98cb-ece4-4a7e-a1c0-b8815acc51b7","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/170aae71-9b16-49b1-be29-44f98db2f72e","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/170aae71-9b16-49b1-be29-44f98db2f72e_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10063","date":"2021-03-22T20:11:09.360Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/170aae71-9b16-49b1-be29-44f98db2f72e_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10063","date":"2021-03-22T20:12:18.837Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/170aae71-9b16-49b1-be29-44f98db2f72e_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6f6de114-b72c-416d-9e87-dddd4b1e3f24_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Compound heterozygous missense variants w/o variant-level evidence","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a7357775-462a-4ec4-be08-f7bba3028651","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30001929","rdfs:label":"ME3","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":16,"detectionMethod":"Genomic DNA was extracted and next generation sequencing used to identify HINT1 mutations and sanger sequencing to confirm them.

In an interaction with SUMO1, R37P and G93D behaved as the WT and G89V increased the association, while the other mutants reduced the level of interaction. When interacting with CaM, mutants C38R and those in the 84-89 region increased the association with the others showing reduced interactions. The evaluation between HINT1 and the NR1 subunit of the glutamate NMDA receptor demonstrated increased association with G38V and G89V, but diminished interactions for all other human HINT1 mutants. Binding to the MOR c-terminal cytosolic tail showed the same pattern, with only G89V not displaying a reduced interaction. RGSZ2, which normally forms stable complexes with HINT1 and MOR, showed a disparate pattern of strengthening or weakening the association with the mutants. Finally, interactions were reduced with ICD Teneurin 1 for all except the 84-89 region and all but C38R and G89V displayed very weak interaction with σ1R. All of these interactions are normally observed at the plasma membrane, with disruption substaintially altering the HINT1-regulated signalling pathways in human probands.\n\nFurther supporting evidence is provided in PMID: 29787766. This publication uses a subset of the variants utilized here and further confirms the structural alteration of mutant HINT1, specifically that R37P, G93D, and W123* exist as monomers rather than forming dimers like the WT. Both the mutant monomers and dimers also suffered from impaired thermal stability compared to the WT. The catalytic activity of the homodimers were comparable to the WT, but all monomers tested showed significantly reduced hydrolysis activity. These futher support the inability of mutant HINT1 to interact with signalling proteins properly.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33404983","rdfs:label":"HINT1 Mutant Protein Interactions"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/170aae71-9b16-49b1-be29-44f98db2f72e_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2a4dc835-b1e4-44f2-9293-9419ebbcd179","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"HINT1's function as an essential signalling protein via isopeptidase activity in the CNS and peripheral nervous system supports both the primary motor neuropathy and neuromyotonia present in the majority of probands.
