Biallelic disease of two fully pathogenic *PKD1* variants results in embryonic lethality and so viable biallelic cases must have at least one hypomorphic allele. This biallelic disease is a significant cause of very early onset PKD and can arise in a family with otherwise typical ADPKD (monoallelic family members). Individuals with a negative family history can have two hypomorphic alleles. At least seventeen unique variants (missense, nonsense, frameshift) that have been reported in thirteen probands in four publications (PMIDs: 19165178, 23624871, 30631912, 33168999) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached (PMIDs: 26139440, 20558538). This gene-disease relationship is also supported by two mouse models, biochemical function data, and expression data (PMIDs: 9326937, 23064367, 11106764, 31427367, 8981910, 11891195). In summary, *PKD1* is definitively associated with autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD-*PKD1*). This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Kidney Cystic and Ciliopathy GCEP on the meeting date 1/11/2023 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2445d9ae-ceb2-4f5e-811c-596cf36322e4","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d38c5bda-7182-403f-a99b-4f8492afb24f","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d38c5bda-7182-403f-a99b-4f8492afb24f_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10066","date":"2023-01-11T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d38c5bda-7182-403f-a99b-4f8492afb24f_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10066","date":"2023-07-05T12:46:42.562Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d38c5bda-7182-403f-a99b-4f8492afb24f_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d38c5bda-7182-403f-a99b-4f8492afb24f_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/57af4fb0-e542-4539-8661-457a582746b6","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cd4b55a2-4cb1-4a91-8f24-424c1b1a1ed7","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Heterozygotes had no discernible phenotype, while homozygotes died during the perinatal period with massively enlarged cystic kidneys, pancreatic ductal cysts, and pulmonary hypoplasia.
