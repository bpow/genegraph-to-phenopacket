The gene is associated with low magnesium levels due to a loss of kidney magnesium, as well as hypokalemia, hypocalciuria, and renal failure. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no relevant differences in molecular mechanism, inheritance pattern or phenotypic variability (there is only one disease assertion for this gene). Therefore, no pre-curation was needed. One variant (the missense variant Gly41Arg) has been reported in 18 probands from one family in 2 publications (PMIDs: 25765846, 11062458) included in this curation. The mechanism of pathogenicity is reported to be loss of function. This gene-disease association is also supported by experimental evidence (biochemical functional evidence, expression level data, functional alteration evidence, and a mouse model; PMIDs: 18787637, 18448590, 18448590, 15755730). In summary, FXYD2 is moderately associated with autosomal dominant renal hypomagnesemia 2. The disease is only associated with one variant in the gene, but there is case-level data (including lots of segregation) and various experimental evidence to support the relationship. Thus, a moderate classification, which was reached based on the point system (7.0 points were reached), felt appropriate. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fe16fb78-9342-40e6-9c7a-5184bdb256d3","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/aef2e6fc-52d8-4077-a5c9-0f70bbebea36","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/aef2e6fc-52d8-4077-a5c9-0f70bbebea36_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10067","date":"2023-06-29T17:50:49.099Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/aef2e6fc-52d8-4077-a5c9-0f70bbebea36_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10067","date":"2023-06-29T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/aef2e6fc-52d8-4077-a5c9-0f70bbebea36_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d748594a-dac2-41ac-8224-86b30b628694","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d748594a-dac2-41ac-8224-86b30b628694_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"Infection of Sf9 insect cells was done with recombinant baculovirus cells.

Unlike in the wild-type cells, the inward rectifying FXYD2 (Na/K ATPase gamma subunit) cation current was triggered by hyperpolarization in oocytes with the Gly41Arg mutation. Administering EDTA to the oocytes with the variant stopped the inward flow, but EDTA did not impact the inward current flow in the normal FXYD2 oocytes. Extracellular ions, Ca2+, Ba2+, and La3+, prevented both wild-type and mutant FXYD2 currents. Site-directed mutagenesis of the Glycine 41 residue showed that a positive charge at this point is necessary for the inward flow. Mutating the 41 residue to a hydrophobic amino acid like leucine or valine allowed FXYD2 channel activity but such that was notably lower than the wild type. However, mutating the residue to glutamine or proline, or negatively charged glutamate, did not substantially change channel function. Yet, changing the residue to lysine, a positively charged amino acid, led to a channel with lots of inward rectification (0.5 points).\n\nWith normal FXYD2 protein, within Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (MDCK), in the conditions of a sizable apical-to-basolateral Mg2+ gradient and at negative potentials, there was an increase in the transepithelial current in comparison to controls or cells with the Gly41Arg mutant. Also, this current can be impeded by extracellular Ba2+ on the basolateral surface. The findings show that FXYD2 may regulate basolateral extrusion of magnesium from renal epithelial cells in culture. \n\nThe findings suggest that the Gly41Arg mutation activates a channel in X. laevis oocytes and MDCK cells that is different than the wild-type FXYD2 channels. The Gly41Arg variant led to substantial inward currents but the outward currents were less than those of the wild type, showing that mutant-activated channels have substantial inward rectification (0.5 points).\n","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18448590","rdfs:label":"Madin-Darby Canine Kidney Cells and Xenopus oocyte cells "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/aef2e6fc-52d8-4077-a5c9-0f70bbebea36_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/31089625-f188-4461-9945-f57534d23f3f","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/038ccd31-895e-4496-ab0d-6307efccb339","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Due to the observations about the gamma subunit, it, not merely alpha/beta, then seems essential for the long-term adaptation to the hypertonic environments.
