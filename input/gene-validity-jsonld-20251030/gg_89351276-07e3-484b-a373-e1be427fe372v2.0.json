PAI-1 is encoded by SERPINE1, a serpin protease inhibitor. Complete plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 deficiency is characterized by moderate bleeding, however life-threatening bleeding events have been documented.  Most commonly, bleeding is delayed after trauma or surgery; spontaneous bleeding does not occur. Evidence supporting this gene-disease curation includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data.   \n\nSummary of Case Level Data (9.0 points): Four unique variants have been reported in humans; three frame shift variants and a missense variant.   Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 3 probands in 3 publications (PMID: 9207454; 21486382; 28229167; 32278876).  Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 6 additional family members.  \n\nSummary of Segregation (LOD Score) (1.5 points): Using candidate gene sequencing, 7 affected individuals and 18 unaffected individuals from an Old Order Amish community were included in the LOD score (PMID: 1435917; 9207454).\n\nSummary of Experimental Data (4 points): This gene disease relationship is supported by biochemical function (PMID: 1435917), Expression (PMID: 1435917), and model systems (PMID: 9529269) experiments.  \n\nIn summary, SERPINE1 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive complete plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) deficiency. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and the clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time.\n\nThis gene-disease pair was originally approved by the HT GCEP in January of 2021.  Subsequent curation was completed in October of 2023 using Gene-Disease Validity Standard Operating Procedures, Version 9.\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/89351276-07e3-484b-a373-e1be427fe372","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/33baf899-f63b-42ed-b2fd-689cca44a7b6","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":[{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},{"id":"cg:newEvidence"},{"id":"cg:classificationChange"},{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"},{"id":"cg:sopChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/33baf899-f63b-42ed-b2fd-689cca44a7b6_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2024-01-25T13:27:00.306Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/33baf899-f63b-42ed-b2fd-689cca44a7b6_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2023-11-06T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["RecurationNewEvidence","RecurationTiming"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/33baf899-f63b-42ed-b2fd-689cca44a7b6_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/07eb17df-ce5b-4471-9ff4-fda03a39dbfa_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/07eb17df-ce5b-4471-9ff4-fda03a39dbfa","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9207454","rdfs:label":"VII-10","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":15,"allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0c21d135-b384-4053-8970-54c5e9e6d729","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000602.4(SERPINE1):c.697_698TA[3] (p.Thr234fs)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA576469413"}},"detectionMethod":"The entire coding sequence, intron-exon junctions and promoter region of SERPINE1 was PCR amplified from genomic DNA and Sanger sequencing was performed.","firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0000978","obo:HP_0100310","obo:HP_0000132","obo:HP_0005261"],"previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"Clinical and laboratory data included family and personal history, physical examination, complete blood counts, prothrombin time, factors VIII, IX, XIII, VWF antigen and activity, platelet aggregation, and bleeding time.","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a23565b7-0d50-49e5-8eac-ea7ffb2ff98e_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9207454","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0c21d135-b384-4053-8970-54c5e9e6d729"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"}}},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a23565b7-0d50-49e5-8eac-ea7ffb2ff98e","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The frameshift variant, c.697_698ins, p.Thr234fs causes a premature stop codon in exon 4 and is expected to undergo NMD.
