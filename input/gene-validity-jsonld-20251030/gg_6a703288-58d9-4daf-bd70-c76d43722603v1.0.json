At least 1 variant (missense) has been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 1 proband in 1 publication (PMID: 27657680). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 10 additional family members. Of note, this gene has also been implicated in other diseases including neurodevelopmental disorders; these will be assessed separately. This gene-disease association is supported by animal models and expression studies (PMID: 27657680, 22875945). In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6a703288-58d9-4daf-bd70-c76d43722603","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/746b46e8-0621-4879-80a1-4fb1679975be","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/746b46e8-0621-4879-80a1-4fb1679975be_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2020-02-06T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/746b46e8-0621-4879-80a1-4fb1679975be_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/746b46e8-0621-4879-80a1-4fb1679975be_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/746b46e8-0621-4879-80a1-4fb1679975be_ad_other_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5bf8c254-6a0f-43a5-847d-642f5274702c_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fb9f108a-8296-4bb1-a56a-43852eaef736","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27657680","rdfs:label":"Individual II-1","ageType":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/","ageUnit":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/","detectionMethod":"Linkage analysis in 10 affected (II-2 not included) and 11 unaffected.
