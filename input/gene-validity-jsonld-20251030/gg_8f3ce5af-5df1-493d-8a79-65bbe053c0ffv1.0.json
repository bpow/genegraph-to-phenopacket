{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8f3ce5af-5df1-493d-8a79-65bbe053c0ffv1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"The *DNAI1* gene was first reported in relation to primary ciliary dyskinesia in 1999 (Pennarun et al, PMID: 10577904). The specific disease entity, primary ciliary dyskinesia 1 (MONDO:0009484, OMIM #244400), is one of at least 45 different primary ciliary dyskinesias distinguished by a single monogenic cause. Affected patients can have onset of symptoms at birth but can also be diagnosed at least as late as during the 3rd decade of life (PMID: 11713099). Frequent features among well-characterized patients are neonatal respiratory distress, sinusitis, otitis media, bronchiectasis, and decreased nasal nitric oxide. Approximately 50% of cases exhibit situs inversus or another form of heterotaxy. Biopsies of the airway epithelium show ciliary ultrastructure with an absence of outer dynein arms and to a lesser degree absence of inner dynein arms. Cilia are largely or completely immotile. Adult patients can exhibit infertility.\n \nThis curation has scored thirteen suspected pathogenic *DNAI1* variants (three missense, three frameshift, four nonsense, and three disrupting splicing), which were collectively reported in thirteen probands in six publications (PMID: 10577904, PMID: 21143860, PMID: 16858015, PMID: 11713099, PMID: 21270641, PMID: 29363216). All of the probands harbored biallelic variants confirmed to be present in trans. No probands were reported to be from consanguineous parents, but two harbored *DNAI1* variants in the homozygous state, while the other eleven probands were compound heterozygous. The molecular mechanism appears to be biallelic loss-of-function with an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance, characterized in at least some cases by variants predicted to trigger the absence of a gene product. More genetic evidence was available (PMID: 11231901, PMID: 21143860, PMID: 16858015, PMID: 11713099) but was not included as the maximum for this category of evidence had already been reached. Large families with segregation data were not found for inclusion in this gene curation. Please note that the genetic evidence scored in this curation has relied heavily on the best-characterized *DNAI1* variants from the literature, while an urgent need remains for additional published data to evaluate the pathogenicity of many other emerging variants.\n \nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence that high levels of *DNAI1* expression in humans are specific to tissues known to harbor multi-ciliated cells, particularly the testis, pituitary gland, fallopian tube, lung, and endocervix (PMID: 23715323). Biochemical studies of the *Chlamydomonas* ortholog of DNAI1 indicate that the protein product is an intermediate dynein chain positioned at the base of the alpha-beta dimer of the outer dynein arms (PMID: 2147183). Its direct interaction with alpha-tubulin (PMID: 1827120) indicates that it may function to link the outer dynein arms with axonemal microtubules, consistent with the ultrastructural defects characteristic of the human patients. The protein also interacts with the *Chlamydomonas* ortholog of DNAI2 (2147183), a related intermediate dynein chain that is associated in humans with primary ciliary dyskinesia 9. Human patient phenotypes such as ciliary immotility and absence of outer dynein arms are recapitulated by *Chlamydomonas* (PMID: 7698982) and other cellular models (PMID: 32823934) of DNAI1 loss of function. More complex patient phenotypes are recapitulated by a combination of conventional (PMID: 24306492) and conditional (PMID: 19675306) mouse models of *Dnai1* loss of function.\n \nIn summary, *DNAI1* is definitively associated with primary ciliary dyskinesia 1. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both research and diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time without the emergence of contradictory evidence, leading to a Definitive classification. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Motile Ciliopathy GCEP on June 9th, 2022 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8f3ce5af-5df1-493d-8a79-65bbe053c0ff","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/396be572-5b2c-4859-90dd-434a91c1ce96","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/396be572-5b2c-4859-90dd-434a91c1ce96_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10102","date":"2022-06-30T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/396be572-5b2c-4859-90dd-434a91c1ce96_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10102","date":"2022-06-30T17:42:17.665Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/396be572-5b2c-4859-90dd-434a91c1ce96_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/396be572-5b2c-4859-90dd-434a91c1ce96_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d58365e5-3225-42c8-8cd6-0f31410ad0b5","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The mouse model partially recapitulated the human patient phenotype at both the cellular and organ levels.
