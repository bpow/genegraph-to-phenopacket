Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data. At least 15 unique variants (missense, nonsense, frameshift, in-frame deletion, and splicing) have been reported in humans. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 14 probands in 5 publications (PMIDs: 28454995, 31144778, 32282878, 15571623, 32705143). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in additional family members. This gene-disease association is supported by its function in glutamate decarboxylase activity (PMID: 1549570), its expression in the brain (PMID: 9177246), and zebrafish model (PMID: 30200754) as well as three mouse models (PMIDs: 9177246, 9326630, 20333300) that partially recapitulate disease. In summary, GAD1 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive epileptic encephalopathy.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5fea0e93-7b81-4b99-aa56-7e95f2de0222","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/20fdee08-81b0-4957-a18a-8f622e0ab054","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/20fdee08-81b0-4957-a18a-8f622e0ab054_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10011","date":"2021-05-13T15:22:39.014Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/20fdee08-81b0-4957-a18a-8f622e0ab054_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10011","date":"2021-05-13T15:22:50.490Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/20fdee08-81b0-4957-a18a-8f622e0ab054_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/20fdee08-81b0-4957-a18a-8f622e0ab054_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/dd1a24c5-05a8-4a36-9b1a-c8af8efb7169","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"gad1b morphant fish displayed abnormal craniofacial features, as reported in 6/14 patients.
