The observed phenotypes in affected males include autism spectrum disorder and/or intellectual disability; attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder is also reported in some individuals. Carrier females are typically unaffected.\n\nNine variants (nonsense, frameshift, splice, missense, and exonic deletion) that have been reported in nine probands in eight publications (PMIDs: 12669065, 14963808, 16648374, 18231125, 19726642, 23352163, 26350204, 28263302) are included in this curation. Variants in this gene were reported to segregate with disease in a large family with 13 affected males (PMID: 14963808). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is loss of function. \n\nIn humans, neuroligin 4 (NLGN4) is encoded by two genes, *NLGN4X* and *NLGN4Y*, that are localized on the sex chromosomes. NLGN4 is a member of the neuroligin family of neuronal cell-adhesion molecules that are localized postsynaptically, interact with presynaptic neurexins, and play a key role in the maturation and function of synapses. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by mouse models displaying neurodevelopmental phenotypes consistent with autism, functional studies, and protein interaction with neurexins (PMIDs: 21278334, 23183221, 24104404, 29106499). In humans, NLGN4 is preferentially expressed in the cortex, whereas mouse Nlgn4 is primarily expressed in the brainstem, retina, and spinal cord. Additionally, in human neurons NLGN4 is preferentially localized to excitatory synapses and only a subset of inhibitory synapses, whereas in mice Nlgn4 is primarily present in glycinergic and GABAergic synapses. These differences, along with the poor conservation of the mouse ortholog of *NLGN4*, called Nlgn4-like (*Nlgn4l*), should be considered when interpreting the relevance of the results obtained in knockout mice.\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *NLGN4X* and X-linked complex neurodevelopmental disorder.

The variant entered is serving as a proxy for the real variant, which may be a deep intronic variant. For now, the variant is thought of as a deletion of exon 4. The score was downgraded because heterozygous female affected status is uncommon in this disorder and because the deletion was identified through candidate gene sequencing rather than with a genome-wide method.","calculatedScore":2.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e51fae85-8144-469c-9839-26a673407975_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16648374","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/94ad0b5c-6aa3-419e-9fec-5749f081d60c","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_181332.3(NLGN4X):c.626-1G>T","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA412012211"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:DeNovoAlleleOrigin"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:Heterozygous"}},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e51fae85-8144-469c-9839-26a673407975_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"Analysis of genomic DNA showed exon 4 skipping, with an in-frame exclusion of 62 amino acids.
