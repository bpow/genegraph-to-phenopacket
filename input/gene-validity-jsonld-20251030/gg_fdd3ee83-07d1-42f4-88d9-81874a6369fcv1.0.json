Variants in PCSK9 were first reported in humans with this disease as early as 2003 (Abifadel et al., PMID: 12730697). At least 15 variants (missense) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 17 probands in 6 publications (PMIDs: 12730697, 15772090, 22683120, 26541928, 29127338, 20006333). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in at least 31 family members. The mechanism for disease is heterozygous gain of function (Maxwell et al., 2005; PMID: 16577715), while heterozygous loss of function variants are associated with low levels of LDL cholesterol (Cohen et al., 2005, PMID: 15654334). This gene-disease association is supported by animal models, expression studies, and in vitro functional assays. In summary, PCSK9 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant familial hypercholesterolemia. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fdd3ee83-07d1-42f4-88d9-81874a6369fc","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bf710ddc-c189-419f-ab70-25300b067db2","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bf710ddc-c189-419f-ab70-25300b067db2_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10026","date":"2020-09-16T19:22:58.208Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bf710ddc-c189-419f-ab70-25300b067db2_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10026","date":"2018-11-14T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10018","role":"SecondaryContributor"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bf710ddc-c189-419f-ab70-25300b067db2_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bf710ddc-c189-419f-ab70-25300b067db2_ad_other_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f2631871-3ffb-42fb-9703-68cedec90f60_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"This variant was identified in families 1 and 2, also from the UK.
