Two variants (at the promoter site) that have been reported in 2 probands in one publication (PMID: 19666657) are included in this curation. A second publication details an affected individual with a homozygous missense variant, although heterozygous familial carriers are unaffected (PMID: 33615071). The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss of function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by expression in podocytes, interaction with CD2AP, and a knockout model demonstrating conditionally stimulated nephrotic syndrome along with podocytes showing impaired actin filament reformation in vitro (PMIDs: 15841212, 16628251, 33615071). In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Glomerulopathy GCEP on the meeting date November 13, 2023 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9cd6b4c3-304d-4252-a815-7a7f01dfd968","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/12a82f02-cc6b-41a0-b2b7-7d8c18ff470b","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/12a82f02-cc6b-41a0-b2b7-7d8c18ff470b_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10068","date":"2023-11-13T19:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/12a82f02-cc6b-41a0-b2b7-7d8c18ff470b_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10068","date":"2025-09-24T21:58:34.386Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/12a82f02-cc6b-41a0-b2b7-7d8c18ff470b_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/12a82f02-cc6b-41a0-b2b7-7d8c18ff470b_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/34333472-ff30-4bbb-a620-d20c16b1f486","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The score of this model was downgraded to 1 point given that phenocopying was stimulation dependent.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/adee9731-ead1-48e4-8b60-18178a15f984","type":"Finding","dc:description":"This mouse model displays nephrotic syndrome under stimulated conditions.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15841212","rdfs:label":"Mouse Model","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/12a82f02-cc6b-41a0-b2b7-7d8c18ff470b_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/37385257-dd03-4d32-b301-7535eb9cdd0a","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/18588fba-c459-4e77-857e-1f30c9c9fcab","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Synpo -/- podocytes showed impaired actin filament reformation in vitro.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15841212","rdfs:label":"Impaired actin filament reformation in vitro"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/12a82f02-cc6b-41a0-b2b7-7d8c18ff470b_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e0815153-1448-4ffc-96e5-ec76a6afbc9c","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7e18abc1-dd72-4556-98ea-70dd1c65f51b","type":"Finding","dc:description":"To test for an interaction between Synpo and CD2AP, immunoprecipitates were prepared from podocyte cell lysates using Synpo antibodies.
