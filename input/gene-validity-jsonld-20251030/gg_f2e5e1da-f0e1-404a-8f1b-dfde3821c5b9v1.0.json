It is characterized by progressive adult-onset myopathy without facial weakness. Heterozygous ariants in the *BIN1* gene have been reported in seven patients with autosomal dominant centronuclear myopathy in three publications (PMIDs: 25260562, 27854204, 29103045). Seven unique variants have been reported, falling into two types either missense or single amino acid deletions in the N-terminal amphipathic helix, where a dominant negative effect has been observed (PMID: 25260562), or frameshifts near the C-terminus which extend the protein and may impact SH3 domain folding or interaction with other proteins. This gene-disease relationship is further supported by its biochemical function in the t-tublue system (PMID: 31857086), enhanced expression in skeletal muscle (PMID: 9182667), protein-protein interaction with *DNM2* (PMID: 15483625), and functional alteration in patient cells (Böhm J, et al., 2014, PMID: 25260562). In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship.\n\nOf note, *BIN1* has also been reported in relation to autosomal recessive centronuclear myopathy. Due to the proposed difference in mechanism, loss of function, those cases were considered in a separate curation.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f2e5e1da-f0e1-404a-8f1b-dfde3821c5b9","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8bb963a9-ec8a-4966-93bb-4f8ef6f8f8a1","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8bb963a9-ec8a-4966-93bb-4f8ef6f8f8a1_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10031","date":"2024-06-10T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8bb963a9-ec8a-4966-93bb-4f8ef6f8f8a1_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10031","date":"2024-06-10T16:41:21.251Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8bb963a9-ec8a-4966-93bb-4f8ef6f8f8a1_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ce6bf2e1-c2ac-440e-91fe-d6d5a1ef376f","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ce6bf2e1-c2ac-440e-91fe-d6d5a1ef376f_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"The single nucleotide deletion is predicted to shift the reading frame of the regular stop codon and generate an extended amphiphysin 2 protein containing 52 supernumerary C-terminal amino acids (p.Ter594AspfsTer53).
