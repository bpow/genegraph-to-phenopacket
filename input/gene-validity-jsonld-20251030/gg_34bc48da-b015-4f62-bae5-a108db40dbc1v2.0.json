At least four unique truncating variants identified by exome sequencing have been reported in humans in four consanguineous families (PMIDd: 27816943, 36217027). Evidence ​supporting this gene-disease relationship includes ​case-level genetic evidence suggesting loss of *MAP3K20,* as well as expression studies suggesting enhanced protein expression in affected tissues (PMID: 27816943). Additionally, MAP3K ZAKβ was established as a kinase activated upon cellular compression, with a particularly pronounced function in skeletal muscle, where it mediates contraction‐induced activation of p38 and JNK and a knockout mouse model recapitulated disease (PMID: 35899396). ZAKβ knockout zebrafish provided further disease modeling with age-related reduced locomotion (PMID: 37427997). In summary, there is strong evidence supporting the relationship between *MAP3K20* and ​autosomal recessive centronuclear myopathy.\n\nThis gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the CM GCEP on 06/08/2020. It was reevaluated on 10/21/2024. As a result of this reevaluation new genetic (PMID: 36217027) and experimental evidence (PMID: 35899396, PMID: 37427997) was identified increasing the classification from Moderate to Strong (SOP Version 11).\n\nOf note, biallelic loss-of-function variants in the kinase domain lead to centronuclear myopathy 6, whereas biallelic variants in the SAM domain, which have been associated with increased kinase activity (Vind et al. 2020), have been associated with limb anomalies and hearing loss. Per lumping and splittling guidelines these were considered distinct disease entities and only centronuclear myopathy 6 is included in this curation.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/34bc48da-b015-4f62-bae5-a108db40dbc1","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/03628749-51d6-437e-9816-1e32852645cf","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":[{"id":"cg:newEvidence"},{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},{"id":"cg:sopChange"},{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"},{"id":"cg:classificationChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/03628749-51d6-437e-9816-1e32852645cf_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10031","date":"2024-10-28T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/03628749-51d6-437e-9816-1e32852645cf_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10031","date":"2024-11-25T15:16:04.789Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"The Congenital Myopathies GCEP has modified the classification from Definitive to Strong due to the low number of case reports available and the lack of specificity in disease recapitulation of animal models.","curationReasons":["RecurationNewEvidence","RecurationTiming"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/03628749-51d6-437e-9816-1e32852645cf_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/03628749-51d6-437e-9816-1e32852645cf_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/989f14ea-7ac0-4e7b-b167-a42f990571e4","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"This expression data is in agreement with the Human Protein Atlas, which suggests enhanced expression in skeletal muscle.","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/213c6bb2-43c8-4695-b9b9-c150c95495ad","type":"Finding","dc:description":"RT-PCR detection of MAP3K20 in a variety of mouse tissues and differentiating mouse and human cells revealed expression in multiple tissue types with enhanced expression observed in type I skeletal muscles (diaphragm and soleus), as well as increased expression in dividing myoblasts compared to differentiating myotubes.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27816943","rdfs:label":"MAP3K20 expression in mouse tissue and mouse and human cells","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/614c93d4-fadb-4b65-968e-9395aee4a97a","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0c2edd1c-f5f8-45f8-b964-96547eb791e1","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Here, the authors show that the ubiquitously expressed MAP3K20 splice form ZAKβ is activated by osmotic shock and mechanical compression of cells.
