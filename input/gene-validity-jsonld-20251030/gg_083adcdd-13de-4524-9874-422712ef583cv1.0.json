{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/083adcdd-13de-4524-9874-422712ef583cv1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"*ANO5* was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant gnathodiaphyseal dysplasia (GDD) in 2004 (Tsutsumi et al., PMID: 15124103). The condition is characterized by bone fracture susceptibility, reduced bone density, abnormal trabeculae, diaphyseal cortical thickening, dental anomalies, and jaw lesions and enlargement. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting guidelines, we found differences in inheritance pattern, molecular mechanism, and phenotypic variability. Therefore, the following disease entities have been split into two disease entities: autosomal dominant GDD (OMIM: 166260) and autosomal recessive limb girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD, OMIM: 611307). The split curation for autosomal recessive LGMD has been performed separately. Ten variants (all missense) that have been reported in at least 40 probands in 6 publications (PMID: 15124103, 23047743, 27541832, 28176803, 32902009, 35758145) are included in this curation. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be either gain-of-function or partial loss-of-function, but is unclear; a gain-of-function of phospholipid scramblase activity is the main mechanistic hypothesis (PMIDs: 29124309, 32112655). This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence (mouse models, biochemical functional evidence; PMIDs: 30557634, 34841576, 35982081). The mouse models show altered bone density and volume, trabecular anomalies, and impaired bone development. In summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *ANO5* and autosomal dominant GDD. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Skeletal Disorders GCEP on the meeting date 2/3/2025 (SOP Version 11).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/083adcdd-13de-4524-9874-422712ef583c","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ef25799d-71a4-414c-8826-6d90c5b24d4b","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ef25799d-71a4-414c-8826-6d90c5b24d4b_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10065","date":"2025-02-03T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ef25799d-71a4-414c-8826-6d90c5b24d4b_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10065","date":"2025-04-08T15:33:16.476Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ef25799d-71a4-414c-8826-6d90c5b24d4b_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5c8a8af0-1957-45fb-b429-cd96e0b595e1","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Upgrading 0.5 pts. due to radiographic imaging showing bilateral and relatively symmetric lesions of maxilla with calcification in some regions.
