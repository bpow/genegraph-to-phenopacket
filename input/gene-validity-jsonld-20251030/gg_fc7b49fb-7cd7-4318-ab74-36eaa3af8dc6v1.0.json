{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fc7b49fb-7cd7-4318-ab74-36eaa3af8dc6v1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"The relationship between MFF and Leigh syndrome spectrum was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of September 21, 2020. The MFF gene encodes mitochondrial fission factor, which plays an important role in mitochondrial fission. Mitochondria are dynamic organelles constantly moving along the cell cytoskeleton and form functional networks in many cells. Mitochondria undergo frequent fusion and fission events, which allow formation of these networks. Defects in MFF lead to abnormal mitochondrial morphology and dynamics.\n\nThe MFF gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Leigh syndrome spectrum in 2016 (PMID: 26783368). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included five variants identified in four cases in three publications (PMIDs: 26783368, 30581454, 32181496). No segregation data were available. Loss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease association is also supported by known biochemical function, expression, and functional alteration in patient cells (PMIDs: 27977873, 25613900, 26783368).\n\nIn summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on September 21, 2020 (SOP Version 7).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fc7b49fb-7cd7-4318-ab74-36eaa3af8dc6","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4484881f-277f-47a2-b1dd-70072ec941e0","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4484881f-277f-47a2-b1dd-70072ec941e0_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2021-04-09T14:18:47.498Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4484881f-277f-47a2-b1dd-70072ec941e0_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2021-04-09T14:18:36.756Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4484881f-277f-47a2-b1dd-70072ec941e0_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4484881f-277f-47a2-b1dd-70072ec941e0_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e3e0deb2-4905-4e87-bebe-b18b84832e6d","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"LoF variants in MFF result in mitochondrial (porin) and peroxisomal biogenesis defects (catalase)","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/40f12bac-a6f9-4ad0-9706-33b5818c822c","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"DRP1, catalase and porin amounts were normal in patient fibroblasts compared with controls (Fig 3).

Epileptic seizures emerged at the age of 18 months and were characterized by oro-buccal automatisms, lids myoclonias, hyperventilation with cyanosis and slow anteflexion of the head. At that time, critical EEGs showed rapid activity with rhythmic anteriorly dominant spikes and atypical spike-wave complexes. On evaluation, at 20 months of age, the child presented with  microcephaly, failure to thrive, mild dysmorphic features and exotropia. He appeared hyporeactive and inconstantly responsive, with reduced finalistic movements, and showed severe axial hypotonia, with poor head and trunk control, and spasticity with distal dystonic postures of the limbs. In the following years the epileptic phenotype changed into clonic and tonic-clonic seizures. Mild hepatic steatosis and cholestasis were also detected at 4 years of age, which improved later. \nBrain MRIs showed bilateral lesions of putamen, globus pallidus, caudate, and dentate nuclei, compatible with the diagnosis of Leigh Syndrome (Figures 1A–C). On examination at the age of 5 years he showed: severe intellectual disability, microcephaly, spastic-dystonic tetraparesis, severe optic atrophy, and ophthalmoplegia. An extensive metabolic work-up showed lactic acidosis (maximum value: 3.2 mmol/l; reference values 0.5–1.2 mmol/L), and increased lactate in CSF (26.23 mg/dL; reference values 2.25–10 mg/dL). \nOver time his clinical conditions progressively worsened, with severe reduction of the child’s reactivity to outer stimuli, a progressive worsening of the spasticity with loss of head and trunk control and a reduction of the spontaneous finalistic movements. Likewise, serial MRIs showed a progressive worsening of brain lesions, with extension of the previously described alterations and severe atrophy of corpus callosum and cerebellum (Figures 1D–F). He suffered from epileptic seizures and asleep EEGs showed multifocal epileptic discharges.","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3149cc18-60ad-4a13-a6b7-1553b525c860_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30581454","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/128dac33-672a-4d85-94ec-3805fcc22111","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001277062.2(MFF):c.739C>T (p.Arg247Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA2148063"}}}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/dcbcd835-111f-414e-897b-a3365abe4150_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d0d1cbdf-58a4-4d3d-a788-242a3c6e61e4","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26783368","rdfs:label":"Patient 1","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":7,"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"At age 7 months he was admitted to hospital due to infantile spasms, and a subsequent EEG showed hypsarrhythmia.
