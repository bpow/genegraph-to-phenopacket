At least 21 unique variants (including missense, nonsense, frameshift, and splicing) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 9 probands in 2 publications (PMIDs: 12717434, 17610559). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence has been reached. This gene disease association is supported by its biochemical function as a cargo receptor for the ER-to-Golgi transport of factor V and factor VIII ( PMID: 15886209), its interaction with LMAN1 (PMID: 12717434) which is also implicated in this disease, and a knockout mouse model (PMID: 29735583) that also exhibits reductions of both factor V and factor VIII. In summary, MCFD2 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive inheritance of factor V and factor VIII, combined deficiency. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7725525c-d88a-4edd-9180-fb8200ed5fd9","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/afa4ae2a-c40d-4f25-affe-852a67144cdd","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/afa4ae2a-c40d-4f25-affe-852a67144cdd_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2021-11-03T13:27:52.854Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/afa4ae2a-c40d-4f25-affe-852a67144cdd_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2020-06-24T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/afa4ae2a-c40d-4f25-affe-852a67144cdd_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/afa4ae2a-c40d-4f25-affe-852a67144cdd_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/47b8283f-c4c7-4e10-a946-ad222b6774db","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"F5F8D is recapitulated in mild form in this KO mouse model.
