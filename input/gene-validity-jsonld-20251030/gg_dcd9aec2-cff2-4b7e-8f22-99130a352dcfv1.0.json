TCF12-related craniosynostosis most often involve the fusion of coronal sutures and individuals can present with other syndromic features including dental malocclusion, blepharoptosis, dysmorphic appearance of the face and external ears, and minor limb anomalies (PMID: 23354436). Eleven variants (frameshift, nonsense, splice) that have been reported in 11 probands in 4 publications (PMIDs: 23354436, 25271085, 24736737, 30858722) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature but the maximum points for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is reported to be haploinsufficiency (heterozygous loss of function). This gene-disease association is also supported by animal models, expression studies, and protein interaction with TWIST1 (PMIDs: 23354436, 30375332, 32179550). In summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between TCF12 and autosomal dominant TCF12-related craniosynostosis. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Craniofacial Malformations GCEP on the meeting date 1/28/21 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/dcd9aec2-cff2-4b7e-8f22-99130a352dcf","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/11e46ed0-dbfb-4151-ba1c-cc56214d6ca6","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/11e46ed0-dbfb-4151-ba1c-cc56214d6ca6_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10059","date":"2021-04-02T18:48:46.718Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/11e46ed0-dbfb-4151-ba1c-cc56214d6ca6_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10059","date":"2021-01-28T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/11e46ed0-dbfb-4151-ba1c-cc56214d6ca6_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/11e46ed0-dbfb-4151-ba1c-cc56214d6ca6_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9241381b-fabf-4d64-b458-6e283ee871d0","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7491fb86-8e5e-4097-ad65-35630af9a2a2","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Both humans and mice develop coronal craniosynostosis.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23354436","rdfs:label":"Mouse model","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ca9997b7-b9d6-4348-bea1-933ab26ee839","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cb147c2b-f9b7-4e59-a4bf-7ae48f1df9c6","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Both zebrafish and humans experience coronal synostosis.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30375332","rdfs:label":"Zebrafish model","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/11e46ed0-dbfb-4151-ba1c-cc56214d6ca6_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d37eeb1d-54d2-4690-be2f-ef36114b54d0","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Upgraded because shown in two different cell lines","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9a9af183-cf2e-4080-b4f5-9f1d31e61250","type":"Finding","dc:description":"3 biological replicates of an immunoprecipitation using an anti-TWIST1 antibody in parallel with a mouse IgG control was conducted in an over-expressing human TWIST1 Madin-Darby Canine Kidney cell line\nTCF12 was identified as a binding partner (Figure 1E)\nEngineered mouse embryonic stem cells in which TWIST1 expression was inducible were differentiated into embryoid bodies (EBs)\nCoimmunoprecipitation experiments performed with these EBs showed that TWIST 1 interacted with endogenous TCF12 (Figure 1F)","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32179550","rdfs:label":"Co-Immunoprecipitation","demonstrates":{"id":"obo:MI_0915"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5ac787b3-8afe-4929-bf2c-edc2d6a93966","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c25f1e84-521b-4fab-bb50-482c9ac766e1","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Tcf12 expression was observed within the mesenchyme of not only the coronal but also the metopic and sagittal sutures.
