At least 1 variant (missense) has been reported in 1 proband (PMID:17847009). A Cd96 -/- mouse model did present any neurodevelopmental phenotype and the mice were mainly, phenotypically normal (PMID: 24658051). Therefore this mouse model was not scored. In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal relationship, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the Craniofacial Malformations Gene Curation Expert Panel on meeting date 01/16/2025 (SOP Version 11) ","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9d6c22df-6a81-42f7-93ab-cb8c4965c776","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fdae504e-96de-425c-a175-8934a38510de","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fdae504e-96de-425c-a175-8934a38510de_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10059","date":"2025-01-16T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fdae504e-96de-425c-a175-8934a38510de_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10059","date":"2025-04-08T18:45:45.245Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fdae504e-96de-425c-a175-8934a38510de_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fdae504e-96de-425c-a175-8934a38510de_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3ea1884b-c3dc-4a80-bbb1-17fe1e7e5e5a","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Cd96−/− mice do not present any neurodevelopmental phenotype and are, mainly, phenotypically normal","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4167f87c-16f6-46a9-ab8e-04ba7bb388c6","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Not similar to phenotype observed in humans ","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24658051","rdfs:label":"Cd96−/− mice","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":0}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fdae504e-96de-425c-a175-8934a38510de_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/aacff287-8a48-4a66-940c-2a39d7881d66","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/aacff287-8a48-4a66-940c-2a39d7881d66_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"Cells with T280M mutated CD96 protein lost adhesion and growth activities in vitro","functionalDataSupport":"Yes"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/aacff287-8a48-4a66-940c-2a39d7881d66_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17847009","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/206418be-ca90-4b72-9138-d9995122bbdb","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_005816.5(CD96):c.791C>T (p.Thr264Met)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA116979"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:Heterozygous"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"evidenceStrength":"Limited","sequence":10209,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria11","strengthScore":0.5,"subject":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/BBmbohrRK1Q","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0008893","gene":"hgnc:16892","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"1.0","websiteLegacyID":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/assertion_fdae504e-96de-425c-a175-8934a38510de-","@context":{"@vocab":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"},"curationReasons":{"@type":"@vocab","@container":"@set"},"GCISnapshot":{"@type":"@id"},"dc:isVersionOf":{"@type":"@id"},"websiteLegacyID":{"@type":"@id"}}}
