GM2A encodes the GM2 activator protein (GM2AP), a small glycolipid transport protein which is essential for the lysosomal breakdown of GM2-gangliosides, sialic acid-containing glycosphingolipids which are components of the plasma membrane, by hexosaminidase A. A deficiency of the GM2AP results in accumulation of GM2-ganglioside and related glycolipids in the lysosomes of neurons, resulting symptoms indistinguishable from the classical Tay-Sachs phenotype. This includes developmental regression, seizures, exaggerated startle response, and presence of a cherry red spot in the retina (Toro et al, 2020, PMID 20301397). \n\nBiallelic variants in GM2A were first reported in patients with Tay Sachs disease, AB variant, in 1991 (Schröder et al, PMID: 1915858). Since then, fifteen families with biallelic variants in GM2A and features of Tay Sachs disease, AB variant, have been reported (İnci et al, 2021, PMID: 33819415, Table1). The mechanism of disease is loss of function.\n\nIn this curation, data on 10 unique variants (3 nonsense, 1 frameshift, 1 canonical splice site, 3 missense, 2 in frame indels) from 8 probands from 7 publications were collected (Schröder et al, 1991, PMID: 1915858; Schröder et al, 1993, PMID: 8244332; Schepers et al, 1996, PMID: 8900233; Chen et al, 1999, PMID: 10364519; Sheth et al, 2016, PMID: 27402091; Martins et al, 2017, PMID: 28417072; İnci et al, 2021, PMID: 33819415). Further information is available in the literature but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. \n\nExperimental evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes the biochemical function of the GM2 activator protein, which is consistent with the biochemical and clinical findings in patients (Smiljanic-Georgijev et al, 1997, PMID: 9187239; Mahuran 1998, PMID: 9714704; Mahuran 1999, PMID: 10571007). The gene product of GM2A is known to interact with the gene product of HEXA, a gene definitively associated with Tay Sachs disease. Lastly, the phenotype of a Gm2a knock out mouse recapitulates the GM2 ganlioside accumulation and some clinical features of Tay Sachs disease (Liu et al, 1997, PMID 9223328). \n\nIn summary, GM2A is definitively associated with Tay Sachs disease, AB variant. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This clinical validity classification was approved by the Lysosomal Diseases GCEP on August 12, 2022 (SOP v9).\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c80a707b-6c4b-487a-99f6-28317455dfd2","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7c793bd3-8433-4632-a571-a3fc07e84c10","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7c793bd3-8433-4632-a571-a3fc07e84c10_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10110","date":"2022-09-29T13:53:36.850Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7c793bd3-8433-4632-a571-a3fc07e84c10_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10110","date":"2022-08-12T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7c793bd3-8433-4632-a571-a3fc07e84c10_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7c793bd3-8433-4632-a571-a3fc07e84c10_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/497e2cb5-248a-4d36-9388-7a2c9edfff22","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/387b2242-2918-4295-87f0-be56bf7a1826","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Like humans with GM2 activator deficiency, Gm2a −/− mice had normal levels of β-hexosaminidase activity, but they accumulate GM2-gangliosides in neuronal tissues which results in neurological symptoms.\nGm2a −/− mice, analyzed at 5 mo, accumulated GM2 ganglioside in their brains at a level comparable to Hexa −/− mice. GM2-ganglioside storage was predominately in large pyramidal neurons (Fig. 4 A and B). Storage was most pronounced in the piriform, entorhinal cortex, and amygdala as well in the hypothalamic nuclei. Prominent storage material was also present in the glial cells, and Purkinje and granular cell neurons (Fig. 4 D and E). There was little storage in the spinal cord and visceral organs.\nRotorod performance was significantly impaired in Gm2a −/− mice when compared with controls (P = 0.033). This was not due to decreased mobility, indicating problems with motor coordination and balance. In the passive-avoidance task there was a small, but significant, difference in latency to enter the dark chamber 24 hr after a foot shock in that location indicating a possible memory deficit in the Gm2a −/− mice. Further studies suggested that the deficit in passive-avoidance learning was not due to shock or pain insensitivity.

The functional assay used purified placental Hex A and GM2 labelled with tritium in the terminal beta-linked GalNAc residue. Incubation was performed at 37C with varying amounts of GM2A protein (Table 1). They then used a fluorescence dequenching assay specific for only the hydrophobic binding pocket and showed that various glycolipids inhibit transport between liposome, by the activator protein, of a self-quenching fluorescent lipid probe. The level of inhibition produced by each glycolipid was used to characterize the oligosaccharide-binding specificity of the activator. It was found that the activator binds GM2 ganglioside with the highest affinity, nearly totally inhibiting the transfer reaction (Table 2).\nA truncated form of the activator protein, containing residues 32–157 plus an additional 13 unrelated amino acids at its C-terminus, did not enhance the hydrolysis of GM2A by Hex A and it was also inactive in the fluorescent dequenching assay. This showed that the hydrophobic binding site was either incomplete or non-functional. \nThis study is part of a large body of evidence (reviewed in Mahuran 1998, PMID: 9714704; Mahuran 1999, PMID: 10571007).) showing that the GM2A proteins is important for the function of  hexosamininase A (HexA), a lysosomal enzyme involved in the breakdown of GM2 ganglioside. Without HexA activity, GM2 ganlioside accumulates in tissues, particularly neuronal cells, resulting in developmental regression, seizures, and other neurological symptoms as well as cheery red spot in the macula, a classifc features of Tay Sachs disease and some other lysosomal storage disorders.

This data is included here, rather than in the “rescue” section, as evidence supporting the diagnosis of this patient.\nResults from pulse-chase showed that patient B synthesized a shorter, low-molecular-weight GM2AP precursor which was N-glycosylated, but which was unstable and was not secreted (Fig 3).\nIn the presence of BFA, the normal 21.9-kD GM2AP precursor accumulated in the normal cells but no cross-reactive material was present in the cells of patient B, suggesting that the mutant protein is retained and degraded within the ER.\n","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/558ef540-f460-455d-ae04-2e9c2c79afd8_variant_evidence_item"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/88ab98bc-260d-449a-91c9-2d6ced0d49f9_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e4e998d1-4701-44af-8309-3cf4b3267d68","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e4e998d1-4701-44af-8309-3cf4b3267d68_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28417072","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f27064da-4b17-4589-8fd8-de8b2106fec9","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000405.5(GM2A):c.259G>T (p.Glu87Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA361807522"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e824d0e5-8c34-4090-b343-7e394bcba82d","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e824d0e5-8c34-4090-b343-7e394bcba82d_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"Also reported in Salih et al, 2015, (PMID: 26203402)","functionalDataSupport":"No"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e824d0e5-8c34-4090-b343-7e394bcba82d_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28417072","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/001a8e5e-20d6-4cca-b5db-cf066d4e2d2d","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000405.5(GM2A):c.164C>T (p.Pro55Leu)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA186039"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":0.1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/88ab98bc-260d-449a-91c9-2d6ced0d49f9","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28417072","rdfs:label":"Martins_2017_juvenile case","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":9,"allele":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f27064da-4b17-4589-8fd8-de8b2106fec9"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/001a8e5e-20d6-4cca-b5db-cf066d4e2d2d"}],"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"“unusual juvenile clinical onset”, likely had motor dysfunction before 12 months old, presented with possible absence seizures at age 3 years, first generalized seizures at 5 years old Brain MRI detected a rapid onset of diffuse atrophy.
