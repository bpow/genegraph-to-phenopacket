Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in molecular mechanism, inheritance pattern, or phenotypic variability. Therefore, the following disease entities have been lumped into one disease entity, Immunodeficiency 49, severe combined (OMIM:617237) and Intellectual developmental disorder with dysmorphic facies, speech delay, and T-cell abnormalities (OMIM:618092). Affected individuals have delayed psychomotor development, intellectual disability, speech delay, dysmorphic features, dental anomalies, recurrent infections, low or poor proliferation of T-cells, and allergic disease in some. 15 variants (missense, nonsense, and frameshift) that have been reported in 15 probands in four publications (PMIDs: 27959755, 29985992, 37860968, 33194885) are included in this curation. All of variants occurred likely de novo with confirmed parental relatedness and 12 of the 13 truncations occurred in the last exon. The mechanism of pathogenicity is known to be loss of DNA binding function either by dominant negative or haploinsufficiency. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by animal models, rescue studies, expression studies, and functional alteration studies (PMIDs: 27959755, 22588081, 20538915, 28951542). BCL11B is expressed in T-cells and is required for T-cell development. Knockout mice have reduced neuronal progenitor cell proliferation and impaired neuronal differentiation. Introduction of human BCL11B rescued the arrest in T-cell development and corrected the craniofacial abnormalities caused by bcl11ba knockdown in Zebrafish. BCL11B forms a homodimer and a heterodimer with BCL11A. BCL11B pathogenic variants interfere with the function of both BCL11A and BCL11B in suppressing NK cell-related gene expression. In summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between BCL11B and autosomal dominant BCL11B-related BAFopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.This classification was approved by the ClinGen SCID-CID GCEP on the meeting date December 19, 2024 (SOP Version 11).\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cba744cb-afab-4506-a501-77e19cc0387c","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8ca4f24f-78dd-4dda-a50d-07dd3d1cef07","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8ca4f24f-78dd-4dda-a50d-07dd3d1cef07_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10081","date":"2025-02-04T18:40:30.396Z","role":"Publisher"},{"agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","role":"SecondaryContributor"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8ca4f24f-78dd-4dda-a50d-07dd3d1cef07_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10081","date":["2025-01-18T17:00:00.000Z","2024-12-19T17:00:00.000Z"],"role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["ErrorClarification"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8ca4f24f-78dd-4dda-a50d-07dd3d1cef07_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8ca4f24f-78dd-4dda-a50d-07dd3d1cef07_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9ba94f2f-81a1-47ef-a2aa-15455ef4faab","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/465494e7-8815-486e-8cc4-4e2d02f681fa","type":"Finding","dc:description":"To determine Bcl11b expression in T cells at the single-cell level, we produced and analyzed a Bcl11b-tdTomato knock-in mouse (fig.

In contrast, the majority of thymic NK cells, identified by CD127 (9), expressed Bcl11b (figs. S2D and S3E). Moreover, using quantitative real-time PCR (QRT-PCR) analysis, we showed that, in both CD4+ and CD8+ splenic T cells, Bcl11b transcription in naïve (CD44−CD62L+) T cells was roughly two times that in activated T cells (CD44+CD62L−) (figs.

gain further insight into the molecular effects of the four premature termination codon mutations likely escaping NMD [i.e. p.(Tyr455*), p.(Glu499*), p.(Thr502Hisfs*15), p.(Arg518Alafs*45), p.(Asp534Thrfs*29), p.(Gly64 9Alafs*67) and p.(Gly820Alafs*27)] we turned to a previ- ously-established mouse model (Simon et al., 2012; Venkataramanappa et al., 2015) and analysed the influence of the most C-terminally located frameshift mutation p.(Gly820Alafs*27) on hippocampal neurogenesis. As expected, hippocampal slice cultures derived from Bcl11b homozygous mutant mice displayed severely reduced progenitor cell proliferation at 11 days in vitro (Simon et al., 2012). This phenotype was completely rescued upon re- introduction of a cDNA construct (pIRES2-EGFP) into the Bcl11b mutant hippocampus containing either wild- type BCL11B (human) or Bcl11b (murine), but not by an equimolar amount of cDNA bearing the mutation as identified in Patient A:II-3 (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. 3).","functionalDataSupport":"No"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":10}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":9899,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria11","strengthScore":16,"subject":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/n-cVsBoVAKI","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0060763","gene":"hgnc:13222","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"1.2","websiteLegacyID":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/assertion_8ca4f24f-78dd-4dda-a50d-07dd3d1cef07-","@context":{"@vocab":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"},"curationReasons":{"@type":"@vocab","@container":"@set"},"GCISnapshot":{"@type":"@id"},"dc:isVersionOf":{"@type":"@id"},"websiteLegacyID":{"@type":"@id"}}}
