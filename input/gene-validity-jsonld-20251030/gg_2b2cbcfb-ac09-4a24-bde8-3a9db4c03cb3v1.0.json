{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2b2cbcfb-ac09-4a24-bde8-3a9db4c03cb3v1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"The relationship between PEX7 and peroxisome biogenesis disorder (type 9B and type 1 Rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata included), an autosomal recessive disorder, was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of January, 2020. PEX7 encodes a receptor for some of the peroxisomal matrix proteins and is involved in the PTS2 import pathway. Peroxisomal biogenesis disorders are caused by defects in various stages of peroxisomal protein import and/or peroxisome biogenesis, involving at least 14 PEX genes. PEX7 belongs to complementation group 11, and mutations in the gene result in peroxisomes devoid of PTS2 import (Braverman et al, 2012, Gene Reviews). \n\nPEX7 was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Peroxisome biogenesis disorder in 1997. (Braverman et al, PMID: 9090381; Motley et al, PMID: 9090382; Purdue et al, PMID: 9090383). At least 38 nonsense, splice site, frameshift, deletion/duplication and missense variants have been reported in humans in the ClinVar database. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data.  \n   \nSummary of Case Level Data (12 points):\nVariants in this gene have been reported in at least 8 probands in 6 publications (PMID: 9090381, 12325024, 26587300, 28742517, 10083738, 25800479). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score (12 points) for genetic evidence is reached. The recurring founder variant, Leu292Ter is most frequently reported and accounts for 51% of disease alleles.      \nThe mechanism for disease is expected to be biallelic loss of function.  \n  \nSummary of experimental data (5 points):\nThis gene-disease association is supported by in vitro functional assays and animal models. PEX7 interacts with PEX5, which is involved in the PTS1 import pathway  but also acts as a coreceptor for the PEX7-cargo protein complex in the PTS2 pathway (PMID: 26450166, 25538232). Mouse models of PEX7 recapitulate the human disease (PMIDs: 12915479, 20060764) and wild-type PEX7 restores peroxisome import in patient-derived PEX7-deficient cells (PMIDs: 9090381).  \n  \nIn summary, PEX7 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive Peroxisome biogenesis disorder.\t This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Peroxisomal Disorders GCEP on February 14, 2020 (SOP Version 7).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2b2cbcfb-ac09-4a24-bde8-3a9db4c03cb3","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d0796d69-b304-4670-b4a2-8785ff6fd161","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d0796d69-b304-4670-b4a2-8785ff6fd161_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10049","date":"2020-02-14T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d0796d69-b304-4670-b4a2-8785ff6fd161_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10049","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d0796d69-b304-4670-b4a2-8785ff6fd161_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a866416d-23bc-4672-a5cd-c574a45ce0c2_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The proband was homozygous for the intron 2 splice donor variant, c.188+1G>C.

They showed smaller skeleton, but no obvious skeletal abnormalities, visible cataracts. Tissue plasmalogen levels were 30% of the controls, DHA levels were 66%, plasmalogen biosynthesis was reduced. Reduced amounts of mature thiolase and AGPS were found in whole fibroblast cell lysates, indicating impaired PTS2 import. Phytanic acid oxidation was also reduced in Pex7-neo mice. Mice on phytol diet showed phytanic acid accumulation similar to RCDP patients.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20060764","rdfs:label":"Braverman_Mouse","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7fb20ed8-2a06-4a87-8b1d-43c5db131da7","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/04ea5a01-49e6-4618-82db-64918a4f352b","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Pex7-/- is not embryonic lethal and null mice were viable. However, 50% pups died on P0.5, and 20% before weaning. Pups weighed less than wild-type mice, showed varying degree of dwarfism, hypotonia poor feeding and decreased movement. Mutant mice reaching adulthood were not fertile and testicular atrophy in males was seen. Cataracts were often seen when mice first opened their eyes. Primary murine embryonic fibroblasts showed punctate staining indicating normal peroxisomes, but PTS2-import defect was revealed by detection of thiolase precursor and absence of alkyl-DHAP synthase precursor (due to degradation) in protein extracts from liver and brain tissues. Plasmalogen levels were markedly reduced, β-oxidation of C26:0 and pristanic acid was reduced. VLCFA levels were high in newborn pups, but became normal in 2m old pups. Neuronal migration defect and loss or reduction in ossification of cartilage-based structures was noted.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12915479","rdfs:label":"Brites_Mouse model","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1f66aa0f-cf73-4f82-ae2b-6f7e3e6410c0","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/652407e2-8b94-4a01-b372-a65d949ef7fb","type":"Finding","dc:description":"The model PTS2 protein localized to the cytoplasm in fibroblasts from CG11 patients, wherein staining with anti-IPMP70 revealed punctate pattern.
