At least 6 unique variants (nonsense, splicing, frameshift, and large deletion) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 5 probands in 5 publications (PMIDs: 21107324, 21511967, 27879994, 37455884, 38492852). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 1 additional family member. The mechanism for disease is homozygous loss of function. This gene-disease relationship is supported by the biochemical function of *ANO6* as a transmembrane protein essential for the calcium-dependent exposure of phosphatidylserine  (PMID: 21107324), defects in which are responsible for a reduced catalytic platelet surface, which leads to reduced thrombin generation and impaired clot formation in patient cells (PMID: 27879994). Both dog and mouse models recapitulate the defect in phosphatidylserine exposure and bleeding abnormalities (PMIDs: 11895776, 23021219). In summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged.\n\nThis gene-disease pair was previously evaluated by the HT GCEP on 05/27/2020 and 06/22/2022. It was reevaluated on 05/28/2025 and two new cases were identified (PMIDs: 37455884, 38492852) however the classification did not change.\n\nOf note, an additional patient has been identified but is not yet reported in the literature or ClinVar. The patient has reduced/absent thrombin generation and is compound heterozygous for p.R67X/p.E669Dfs*41.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1764f459-a6e0-4657-a8f3-37745312dfd3","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c2d3c125-1938-4295-82bb-b2851a3b2c8d","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","changes":[{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},{"id":"cg:sopChange"},{"id":"cg:newEvidence"},{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c2d3c125-1938-4295-82bb-b2851a3b2c8d_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2025-06-04T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c2d3c125-1938-4295-82bb-b2851a3b2c8d_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2025-06-04T12:49:56.180Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["RecurationTiming","RecurationNewEvidence"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c2d3c125-1938-4295-82bb-b2851a3b2c8d_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c2d3c125-1938-4295-82bb-b2851a3b2c8d_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ea9b4f92-43fe-47c0-aab8-971316c080f0","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"When Ba/F3 cells expressing wild-type ANO6 were treated with A23187, phosphatidylserine was exposed without a lag time, reaching saturation more quickly than the vector-transformed Ba/F3 cells.
