Parkinson´s disease is a progressive degenerative disorder of the central nervous system characterized by loss of dopamine-producing neurons in the substantia nigra, and the presence of specific protein aggregates, termed Lewy bodies, in the substantia nigra and locus coeruleus. In these Lewy bodies, alpha-synuclein forms the major filamentous protein component (Spillantini et al. 1998, PMID: 9600990). Further, the mRNA expression of *SNCA* is increased in mid-brain tissue of sporadic patients with Parkinson´s disease (Chiba-Falek et al. 2006, PMID: 16795004). Signs and symptoms of Parkinson´s disease include tremor which is most pronounced during rest, muscle rigidity, slowing of the voluntary movements (bradykinesia), and a tendency to fall back (postural instability). Several clearly pathogenic, missense variants and *SNCA* gene multiplication have been reported in ~150 patients in ~50 publications (for review see Trinh et al. 2018, PMID: 30357936, www.mdsgene.org). Of these, 17 publications are included in this curation. The additional evidence from the literature was not included in this curation because the maximum score for genetic evidence of gene-disease relation for *SNCA* and Parkinson´s disease was reached  (12 pts.). The *SNCA*-linked phenotype due to missense variants and gene triplications often includes cognitive decline in addition to Parkinson´s disease, has an earlier age at onset and a faster disease progression when compared to idiopathic Parkinson´s disease. In contrast, *SNCA* gene duplication carriers usually resemble idiopathic Parkinson´s disease. The disease follows a dominant mode of inheritance with age-dependent reduced penetrance. Penetrance seems to be the lowest for carriers of the *SNCA*  gene duplication (Chartier-Harlin et al. 2004, PMID: 15451224, Farrer et al. 2004, PMID: 14755720). In addition to the pathogenic variants affecting the coding region of *SNCA*, many candidate and genome-wide association studies have identified non-coding variants within or near the *SNCA* locus as risk factors for Parkinson´s disease, likely through an over-expression paradigm  (Nalls et al. 2019, PMID: 31701892; http://pdgene.org/view?gene=SNCA). One general mechanism of pathogenicity within Parkinson’s disease appears to be the toxic accumulation and aggregation of alpha-synuclein protein (Wong and Krainc 2017, PMID: 2817037). This gene-disease association is further supported by recurrent experimental evidence in animal models, cultured non-human cells, and patient-derived cells demonstrating a tendency for increased accumulation of mutant protein and linked mitochondrial dysfunction, which both are key findings in Parkinson´s disease (Giasson et al. 2002, PMID: 12062037; Kuo et al. 2010, PMID: 20106867; Zhou W 2000, PMID: 10825478; Li et al. 2013, PMID: 24392030; Dettmer et al. 2015, PMID: 26076669; Diao et al. 2021, PMID: 34572052). In summary, pathogenic variants in *SNCA* are definitively causing autosomal-dominant Parkinson´s disease. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Parkinson’s Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on April 19th, 2022.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/33a9732f-3b8f-4743-9e1d-b1ea206a0ba0","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d21593ae-ed10-4442-8167-24f96f917302","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d21593ae-ed10-4442-8167-24f96f917302_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10079","date":"2022-05-03T13:49:31.425Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d21593ae-ed10-4442-8167-24f96f917302_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10079","date":"2022-05-03T13:49:49.423Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d21593ae-ed10-4442-8167-24f96f917302_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c6c4c139-bbd5-40ad-a643-b20c9ade6d54","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c6c4c139-bbd5-40ad-a643-b20c9ade6d54_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"Alpha-synuclein is a major component of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites of both familial and sporadic PD. \nCortical neurons were generated from iPS cells of patients harboring α-syn mutations, including A30P.

Thus, a-synuclein represented an excellent candidate gene for PD.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9197268","rdfs:label":"Italian kindred","estimatedLodScore":4.82,"family":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/969828c3-bf56-4d8e-a703-da8e1e87a93d","type":"Family","rdfs:label":"Italian kindred"},"meetsInclusionCriteria":true,"phenotypePositiveAllelePositive":6,"sequencingMethod":{"id":"cg:CandidateGeneSequencing"}},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/12b5a52e-e8ca-4ccb-9370-679294228b87_family_segregation","type":"FamilyCosegregation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9197268","rdfs:label":"GR2","family":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/12b5a52e-e8ca-4ccb-9370-679294228b87","type":"Family","rdfs:label":"GR2"},"phenotypePositiveAllelePositive":1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/58a6c96a-624c-4cbc-b3fa-4e7045780d66_proband_segregation","type":"FamilyCosegregation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11376188","rdfs:label":"German family","family":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/58a6c96a-624c-4cbc-b3fa-4e7045780d66","type":"Family","rdfs:label":"German family","member":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/15a76804-3bc0-498f-a0f1-51554c97a56a","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11376188","rdfs:label":"IV-3","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fd6b8dc6-b47f-4e31-912d-083409d4043f"},"detectionMethod":"Single strand conformation polymorphism (SCCP) analysis of the coding exons 3 to 7 was performed, and a band shift was detected.

is a major component of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites of both familial and sporadic PD. Human SNCA-Tri NPCs displayed overall normal cellular and mitochondrial morphology, but showed substantial changes in growth, viability, cellular energy metabolism and stress resistance especially when challenged by starvation or toxicant challenge. Knockdown of α-synuclein in the SNCA-Tri NPCs by stably expressed short hairpin RNA resulted in reversal of the observed phenotypic changes. These data show that the SNCA gene triplication set the stage for decreased developmental fitness, accelerated aging, and increased neuronal cell loss (PMID: 25390032). The SNCA triplication lines exhibited a reduced capacity to differentiate into dopaminergic or GABAergic neurons and decreased neurite outgrowth and lower neuronal activity compared with control cultures. This delayed maturation phenotype was confirmed by gene expression profiling, which revealed a significant reduction in mRNA for genes implicated in neuronal differentiation such as delta-like homolog 1 (DLK1), gamma-aminobutyric acid type B receptor subunit 2 (GABABR2), nuclear receptor related 1 protein (NURR1), G-protein-regulated inward-rectifier potassium channel 2 (GIRK-2) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). The differentiated patient cells also demonstrated increased autophagic flux when stressed with chloroquine. We conclude that a two-fold overexpression of α-synuclein caused by a triplication of the SNCA gene is sufficient to impair the differentiation of neuronal progenitor cells, a finding with implications for adult neurogenesis and Parkinson's disease progression, particularly in the context of bioenergetic dysfunction (26610207).

The H50Q mutation affected neither the structure of free or membrane-bound α-Syn monomer, its interaction with metals, nor its capacity to be phosphorylated in vitro. However, compared with the wild-type protein, the H50Q mutation accelerated α-Syn fibrillization in vitro. In cell-based models, H50Q mutation did not affect α-Syn subcellular localization or its ability to be phosphorylated by PLK2 and GRK6. Interestingly, H50Q increased α-Syn secretion from SHSY5Y cells into culture medium and induced more mitochondrial fragmentation in hippocampal neurons. Although the transient overexpression of WT or H50Q did not induce toxicity, both species induced significant cell death when added to the culture medium of hippocampal neurons. Strikingly, H50Q exhibited more toxicity, suggesting that the H50Q-related enhancement of α-Syn aggregation and secretion may play a role in the extracellular toxicity of this mutant. Together, these results provide novel insight into the mechanism by which this newly described PD-associated mutation may contribute to the pathogenesis of PD and related disorders (PMID: 24936070).","functionalDataSupport":"Yes"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/569452a6-f527-4b04-99f8-d8aa2a6c549e_variant_evidence_item"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d21593ae-ed10-4442-8167-24f96f917302_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d21593ae-ed10-4442-8167-24f96f917302_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/950c998b-0dcc-422d-9442-247348df82cb","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/37e8eaa8-53f4-4cc2-9df2-c13830a6cb1a","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Bradykinesia is part of parkinsonism","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12062037","rdfs:label":"Mice Expressing A53T Human alpha-Synuclein","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a2cbcefa-234d-45db-8e9e-0d7dc46ef57e","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Score lowered because the mice do not clearly develop Parkinson´s disease and changes are rather subtle.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0f3b3f2a-4852-4fbd-8126-7b7921fab31e","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Bradykinesia is one feature of parkinsonism","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20106867","rdfs:label":"Transgenic mice","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cb711bb9-6ffa-4595-8886-e81d2e578989","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/57a31311-4aab-46e9-9187-b67ee0ffea52","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Both show aggreggation of the mutated protein","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34572052","rdfs:label":"iPSC-derived dopaminergic neurons","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCellCultureModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/750a46df-37f4-42f3-b156-a462042041ee","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/95db3189-8be6-4e0d-a2d1-fba7177225ff","type":"Finding","dc:description":"cell death of dopaminergic neurons is a hallmark of Parkinson´s disease","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10825478","rdfs:label":"SNCA overexpression in rat primary neuronal cultures","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCellCultureModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d21593ae-ed10-4442-8167-24f96f917302_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c8e281ec-cd79-49e8-a138-f5b503626ecf","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/34994d10-95f8-4e3a-b8ea-4a14c62b8880","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"In both young (7DIV) and mature (14DIV) A53T neurons mitochondria mobility was impaired.
