The *CWF19L1* gene is thought to play a role in cell cycle control, endosomal trafficking and mRNA processing (PMID: 36357319). Autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia due to variants in *CWF19L1* is characterized by gait, limb, and truncal ataxia, developmental delay, hypotonia, intellectual disability, and cerebellar atrophy or hypoplasia on brain imaging. Other features may be present as well and patients typically, but not always, have an early age of onset (PMID: 36453471).\n\nFourteen variants (4 canonical splice-site, 5 missense, 2 frameshift, 2 nonsense, 1 in-frame deletion) that have been reported in 12 probands in 9 publications (PMIDs: 25361784, 26197978, 27016154, 38681507, 36357319, 36530930, 36453471, 37752213, 33012273) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is loss of function.\n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by a morpholino-mediated knockdown of *CWF19L1* in zebrafish that led to cerebellar and movement abnormalities (PMID: 25361784).\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *CWF19L1* and autosomal recessive spinocerebellar ataxia. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Ataxia GCEP on the meeting date May 14, 2025 (SOP Version 11).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/04cce01b-83b7-4069-8d46-0aa4ac918b78","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6ebc1a4b-1a41-40df-832f-904cd4bb88f9","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6ebc1a4b-1a41-40df-832f-904cd4bb88f9_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10155","date":"2025-05-14T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6ebc1a4b-1a41-40df-832f-904cd4bb88f9_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10155","date":"2025-05-14T19:19:08.831Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6ebc1a4b-1a41-40df-832f-904cd4bb88f9_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6ebc1a4b-1a41-40df-832f-904cd4bb88f9_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ec8ecec5-fcf1-46d9-a16d-9334d3ad812a","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0827ecd9-8475-453b-9938-238d621384d6","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Humans with variants in CWF19L1 have been reported to have ataxia and cerebellar atrophy.

MRI showed altered T2/FLAIR intensity in the midbrain, pons, and middle cerebellar peduncles (Fig. 1B, C).","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001263","obo:HP_0002080","obo:HP_0002078","obo:HP_0001260","obo:HP_0002197","obo:HP_0001348","obo:HP_0001310","obo:HP_0010545","obo:HP_0001321","obo:HP_0003487","obo:HP_0002141","obo:HP_0012389"],"secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5a0945a9-dcc1-4c74-9a20-1ea6660e2bba_variant_evidence_item"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria","strengthScore":0.1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":10343,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria11","strengthScore":14,"subject":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/nnbKOJdXQ3k","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0015244","gene":"hgnc:25613","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","websiteLegacyID":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/assertion_6ebc1a4b-1a41-40df-832f-904cd4bb88f9-","@context":{"@vocab":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"},"curationReasons":{"@type":"@vocab","@container":"@set"},"GCISnapshot":{"@type":"@id"},"dc:isVersionOf":{"@type":"@id"},"websiteLegacyID":{"@type":"@id"}}}
