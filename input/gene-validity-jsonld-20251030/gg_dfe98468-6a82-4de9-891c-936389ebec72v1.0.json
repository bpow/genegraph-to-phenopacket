Six multi-gene CNVs that have been reported in six probands in one publication (PMID: 22318994) are included in this curation. In summary, the evidence supporting the relationship between* FMO5* and congenital heart disease has been disputed and no valid evidence remains to support the claim. More evidence is needed to either support or entirely refute the role *FMO5* plays in this disease.
