UNC80 was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive hypotonia, infantile, with psychomotor retardation and characteristic facies 2 in 2016 (Shamseldin et al., 26708753; Stray-Pedersen et al., 26708751). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included 11 unique variants reported in eight cases from four publications (26708753: Shamseldin et al. 2016; 26708751: Stray-Pedersen et al. 2016; 30167850: Bramswig et al. 2018; 30771478: Kuptanon et al. 2019). One variant was a missense with experimental evidence of a loss-of-function effect; the remainder were predicted null variants. No segregation evidence was scored, but variants in this gene co-segregated with disease in three additional family members. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts) has been reached. Biallelic loss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease relationship is supported by knockout/knockdown models in C. elegans and Drosophila, including rescue in C.elegans with the model organism gene, as well as demonstration of an effect on trafficking of the UNC80 protein and sodium NALCN-dependent sodium leak current (18336069: Yeh et al. 2008; 24223770: Lear et al. 2013; 32620897: Wie et al. 2020). In summary, UNC80 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive hypotonia, infantile, with psychomotor retardation and characteristic facies 2. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Syndromic Disorders Gene Curation Expert Panel on the meeting date 4Nov2020 (SOP Version 7).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/88d8866a-a0e0-45e7-aeb3-6dc46427eeb2","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7639160a-1761-4dcb-98de-2aeb61b2b080","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7639160a-1761-4dcb-98de-2aeb61b2b080_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10060","date":"2021-07-30T13:43:47.194Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7639160a-1761-4dcb-98de-2aeb61b2b080_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10060","date":"2021-07-30T13:43:37.292Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7639160a-1761-4dcb-98de-2aeb61b2b080_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bc9a3954-eb1d-4c58-b1ce-f75789e844d6_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Default points since non-consanguineous; Compound heterozygous status confirmed - each parent had one of the variants; \nVariants are located in exons 14 and 26 of 64, respectively and are therefore expected to undergo nonsense mediated decay.
