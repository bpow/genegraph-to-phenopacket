The disease is characterized by poor growth, oral ulcers, mucosal bleeding, recurrent respiratory tract infections, impaired T-cell proliferation, and decreased red blood cell folate levels.\n\nThree variants (two missense, and one deletion) that have been reported in four probands in three publications (PMIDs: 36517554, 36745868, 32276275) are included in this curation. The first patient (PMID: 32276275) with a homozygous missense variant showed signs of anemia and hyperhomocysteinemia, while denying having any bleeding, limb numbness, any other neurologic symptoms, or symptoms of glossitis. Two other patients with different homozygous missense mutations also reported oral bleeding, respiratory distress, and abnormal T-cell count (PMID: 36517554). Another patient with a homozygous deletion variant reported diarrhea, recurrent fevers, and gradually developed curly gray hair (PMID: 36745868). \n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by animal models and rescues (PMID: 11266438). No homozygous RFC1-null pups were identified, indicating that the mutation was embryonic lethal, until a dose of 1 mg of folic acid per day was administrated to RFC1 +/−dams. While there is no established null human probands, there is also no evidence to contradict that null variants in *SLC19A1* for humans would also cause a lethality. \n\nIn summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged. This classification was approved by the ClinGen PIRD GCEP on the meeting date 16th September 2025 (SOP Version 11).\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f5d2102a-4539-44e6-8b85-1de46a9ed3cd","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/90119a3d-be3f-42bd-9ce2-24731b29bca9","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/90119a3d-be3f-42bd-9ce2-24731b29bca9_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10145","date":"2025-09-19T14:10:53.617Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/90119a3d-be3f-42bd-9ce2-24731b29bca9_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10145","date":"2025-09-16T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/90119a3d-be3f-42bd-9ce2-24731b29bca9_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bdbcdb82-5b5b-4650-9a17-b334f02e6bd4_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/289363f6-d135-46a0-98f4-50795b3c1407","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1.0,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/289363f6-d135-46a0-98f4-50795b3c1407_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"Sup Figure 4: Introduction of the c.634_636delTTC mutation into the SLC19A1 gene\nin the hypotriploid K562 cell line.
