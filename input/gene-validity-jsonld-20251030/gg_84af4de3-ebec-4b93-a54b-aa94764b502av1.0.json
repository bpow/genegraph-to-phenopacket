{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/84af4de3-ebec-4b93-a54b-aa94764b502av1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"The relationship between SCO2 and Leigh Syndrome Spectrum was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of March 25, 2019. SCO2 was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Leigh syndrome spectrum in 1999 (Papadopoulou et al 1999 PMID: 10545952) More than 33 unique variants predicted to cause a loss of or reduced function of the protein have been reported in ClinVar, suggesting homozygous loss of function is the mechanism of disease for this gene. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. At least 5 probands with confirmed SCO2 mutations demonstrating a Leigh Syndrome Spectrum phenotype have been reported in 4 publications (PMID: 10545952, 11673586, 18924171, 20159436) to reach a case-level evidence score of 9. This gene-disease association is further supported by the function of the gene product, loss of expression in patient basal ganglia tissue, mitochondrial alterations, disrupted complex IV assembly in patient cell lines, and animal models reaching a maximum experimental score of 6 pts. The mechanism for disease is brain cytochrome oxidase deficiency. In summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between SCO2 and autosomal recessive Leigh syndrome spectrum. More than three years have elapsed from the first proposal of the association to reach a definitive classification. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on March 25, 2019 (SOP Version 6).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/84af4de3-ebec-4b93-a54b-aa94764b502a","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/011dd1c7-94bb-4a70-8b95-cc25432a5ea2","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/011dd1c7-94bb-4a70-8b95-cc25432a5ea2_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2019-03-28T15:42:45.471Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/011dd1c7-94bb-4a70-8b95-cc25432a5ea2_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/011dd1c7-94bb-4a70-8b95-cc25432a5ea2_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/011dd1c7-94bb-4a70-8b95-cc25432a5ea2_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0ec0b043-bed3-412b-b229-295d5a9b78af","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"As per Leigh Working group model scoring rubric, KIKI mouse received 1 pt for evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0709d2b9-96e6-4275-ac90-acc389e8c148","type":"Finding","dc:description":"KIKI mouse demonstrated evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction similar to those seen in patients.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19837698","rdfs:label":"KIKI Mouse","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cf9f0103-36d7-481b-ab70-b074151d8f78","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"As per Leigh Working group model scoring rubric, KIKO mouse received 1.5 pts for evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction and developmental differences","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/59382a9a-7518-4e62-9f2b-0feef5d4183c","type":"Finding","dc:description":"This mouse demonstrated evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction as will developmental difference","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19837698","rdfs:label":"KIKO mouse","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/011dd1c7-94bb-4a70-8b95-cc25432a5ea2_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a418873b-202a-46ef-aa67-1324f12527db","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Additional points were awarded as more than one cell culture model with different mutations or gene disruption demonstrated mitochondrial dysfunction and because assays were ran on mitochondria isolated from a neuronal cell type","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c811dd3a-d903-44ca-a5a5-0355045b50f7","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Mutations in SCO2 result in decrease of COX holoenzyme levels and a reduction in the COX activity in mitochondria isolated from post mortem basal-ganglia samples, accompanied by accumulation of specific COX subcomplexes and unassembled subunits. These decreases were seen in at least two patients with a different combination of mutations in SCO2","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16083427","rdfs:label":"SCO2 patient cell demonstrating mitochondrial dysfunction"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/011dd1c7-94bb-4a70-8b95-cc25432a5ea2_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4743f504-fd52-4c30-bc45-2ffad199e019","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The encoded protein shares a biochemical relationship or function with 2-5 gene products whose dysfunction is known to cause Leigh syndrome receiving an increased score of 1 pt","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2e4f1fe2-5709-4fd0-a1f9-991f55728999","type":"Finding","dc:description":"SCO2 is a metallochaperone that provides a role in copper metabolism and transport into the COX subunits I and II of Complex IV, with mutations in SCO2 demonstrating decreased complex IV assembly and activity (Jaksch et al 2001 PMID: 11751685 and Leary et al 2004 PMID: 15229189 ).
