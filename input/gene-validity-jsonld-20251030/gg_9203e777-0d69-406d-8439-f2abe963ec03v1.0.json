This gene encodes sideroflexin 4 but has a distinct function that differs from that of other sideroflexins (1-3), which are mitochondrial serine transporters. Sideroflexin 4 was initially thought to be involved in Fe-S cluster formation and thus important in heme synthesis, regulation of iron metabolism, and mitochondrial respiration; however subsequently sideroflexin 4 has been shown to be a complex I assembly factor important for incorporation of the ND6 subunit into complex I through an association with the mitochondrial complex I intermediate assembly (MCIA) complex (PMID: 35333655). Defects of this protein lead to complex I deficiency.\n\n*SFXN4* was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive primary mitochondrial disease in 2013 (PMID: 24119684), in two individuals with multisystem mitochondrial disease, and only one further individual has been reported to date.  While various names have been given to the constellation of features seen in those with *SFXN4*-related disease, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *SFXN4* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework.\n\nEvidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included five unique variants (three frameshift, one splice, and one protein elongation) identified in three unrelated individuals from two publications (PMIDs: 24119684, 31059822). All three reported individuals had prenatal onset and were living at the time of report. Features seen include intrauterine growth restriction, developmental delay/mild intellectual disability, muscle atrophy, tremor, incoordination, epilepsy, peripheral neuropathy, decreased vision (one with optic nerve hypoplasia, normal electroretinograms), microcephaly, and macrocytic anemia. Muscle biopsies showed complex I deficiency. Imaging in one patient revealed possible parenchymal volume loss. Elevated blood and cerebrospinal fluid lactates were also seen.\n\nThis gene-disease association is also supported by its known biochemical function (PMID: 33340416), a zebrafish model (PMID: 24119684), and functional alteration in non-patient cells including a rescue experiment (PMIDs: 31873120, 35333655). \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between *SFXN4* and primary mitochondrial disease. This has been repeatedly demonstrated and upheld over time, and no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts this gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on November 20, 2023 (SOP Version 9).
