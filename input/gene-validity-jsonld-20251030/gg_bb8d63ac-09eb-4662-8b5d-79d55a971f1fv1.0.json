Subsequent publications have shown a highly consistent phenotype of infantile onset (<2 years) cerebellar atrophy, myopathy, mild serum CK elevations, developmental delays, and ataxia with or without retinitis pigmentosa. Notably, at the same time of the initial report, a case with proposed dominant inheritance was reported (PMID:2855494), however, since no subsequent dominant cases have been reported (and 22 autosomal recessive cases with a clear and consistent phenotype have been reported), this GCEP elected to curate this gene-disease relationship as an autosomal recessive condition. The possibility of different mechanisms of action leading to both dominant and recessive inheritance cannot be excluded, but additional cases are needed to support autosomal dominant inheritance of *MSTO1*-related disease. Furthermore, while various names have been given to the constellation of features seen in those with *MSTO1*-related disease, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *MSTO1* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework.\n\nEvidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included 13 unique variants (including one nonsense, one frameshift, two splicing, and nine missense variants) in eight probands (although more than 20 probands have been reported in the medical literature) across at least five publications from 2017-2021 (PMIDs: 28544275, 29339779, 30684668, 31463572, 33612823). Loss-of-function is implicated as a mechanism of disease. This gene-disease association is also supported by numerous Drosophila melanogaster models (PMIDs: 29255146, 9144213), functional alteration in non-patient cells showing mitochondrial fragmentation (PMID: 17349998), absence of wild type MSTO1 expression in affected patients but not controls (PMID: 31463572), and rescue of mitochondrial morphology and fusion deficits in patients’ cells transduced with wild type MSTO1 (PMID: 31463572). \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between *MSTO1* and primary mitochondrial disease. This has been repeatedly demonstrated and upheld over time, and no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts this gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on on May 18, 2023.

In order to further confirm that the cellular phenotypes were in fact due to the loss of MSTO1, we transiently expressed wild-type MSTO1 in two of the patient cell lines (P4 and P7) (Fig. 7a, b). Similar to previous reports [16, 35], we found that expression of wild-type MSTO1 restored mitochondrial morphology after 48 h (Fig. 7c). Notably, we also observed more fused mitochondrial networks in control cells overexpressing MSTO1, further validating the role of MSTO1 in promoting fusion. In addition, we also see that lysosome abnormalities are restored (Fig. 7d). While we observed a significant rescue in MSTO1 fibroblasts with regard to mtDNA nucleoid size (Fig. 7e), the number of mtDNA nucleoids did not change in MSTO1 fibroblasts (Fig. 7f). A potential confounding factor is that the transfection protocol itself causes a decrease in mtDNA nucleoid counts, which could be masking a rescue. However, mtDNA copy number was also not rescued after only 48 h (Fig. 7g). This incomplete rescue of mtDNA nucleoid abundance and copy number likely reflects the fact that it may take longer than 48 h for the mtDNA copy number to be re-established.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31463572","rdfs:label":"Rescue of Mitochondrial Fusion in P4's cells with
