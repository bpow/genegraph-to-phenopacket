{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/00cd170a-6097-4b48-9507-479b623b3be4v3.1","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"The relationship between the *DHCR7* gene and autosomal recessive Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS) is well-characterized, with over 150 unique variants described, including nonsense, missense, splice, and deletion variants reported in dozens of publications (GeneReviews: Smith-Lemli-Opitz Syndrome - GeneReviews® - NCBI Bookshelf (nih.gov)). Smith-Lemli-Opitz is characterized by a spectrum of affectedness with the most commonly reported features being delayed growth (including fetal growth restriction), microcephaly, and mild to severe intellectual disability. Other features such as polydactyly, facial dysmorphisms, cardiac defects, renal hypoplasia, increased fetal nuchal translucency, and abnormalities of male genitalia are also common. \n\nBased on a known carrier frequency, there is a lower observed disease prevalence than expected, possibly suggesting increased rates of pregnancy loss in carrier couples SLOS or subclinical presentation of the disease in affected individuals (PMIDs: 28166604, 20556518). There are a few discrepant publications to make such an argument. Analysis of a stillbirth cohort did not yield a significant number of cases with biallelic *DHCR7* pathogenic variants (PMID: 29433144). A study of pregnancies with the homozygous *DHCR7* variant c.964-1G>C (n=32) found intrauterine fetal demise, severe prenatal phenotypes, and death before three months of age (PMID: 32055014). Excess miscarriages were also observed in c.964-1G>C carrier couples (PMIDs: 37301908, 32055014). These observations suggest that homozygosity for *DHCR7* c.964-1G>C variant causes severe prenatal phenotypes and can result in early pregnancy loss but additional information is needed to understand the relationship between prenatal phenotypes and other variants in *DHCR7*. Currently there is no clear relationship of stillbirths in pregnancies with biallelic *DHCR7* pathogenic variants. There is also no data currently supporting the relationship between biallelic *DHCR7* variants and early miscarriages due to the lack of sequencing data are mostly unavailable. \n\nNine probands with twelve unique variants (splice, nonsense, missense) reported in seven publications are reported in this curation. Mechanism of pathogenicity is known to be loss-of-function (PMID: 27401223). \n\nExperimental evidence includes three mouse models of disease, rescue experiments showing normalized 7-DCH levels in patient-derived fibroblasts transfected with WT *DHCR7*, and additional studies demonstrating null or hypomorphic mRNA or protein expression in genes harboring pathogenic variants. Almost all SLOS patients demonstrate intellectual disability (Cunniff et al., 1997; Ryan et al., 1998) and about half meet the DSM-IV criteria for autism diagnosis (Tierney et al., 2000).\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between *DHCR7* and  Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome. While the postnatal presentations of this disorder are relatively well understood, and several such features are observed prenatally, more evidence is needed to understand if there is an increased risk for pregnancy loss in affected pregnancies.\nThis curation was originally approved by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism GCEP on September 9, 2018 (SOP 5). It was later evaluated by the Prenatal Gene Curation Expert Panel on August 15, 2023 (SOP 9). As of June 2024, this record underwent administrative updates to update scoring to be consistent with SOP Version 9 and additions to the evidence summary were made discussing the prenatal presentation. One new case was also added to capture the prenatal presentation of this condition (PMID: 28805615), however the original classification of Definitive remains the same. \n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/00cd170a-6097-4b48-9507-479b623b3be4","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d5ed71c9-a76b-44c0-b5c0-44d604f2e0e9","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d5ed71c9-a76b-44c0-b5c0-44d604f2e0e9_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2024-06-27T14:37:02.670Z","role":"Publisher"},{"agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10106","role":"SecondaryContributor"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d5ed71c9-a76b-44c0-b5c0-44d604f2e0e9_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2023-08-15T06:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["ErrorClarification"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d5ed71c9-a76b-44c0-b5c0-44d604f2e0e9_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0ab721ff-53a5-4fa9-8db5-04f1cebf2b06_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0ab721ff-53a5-4fa9-8db5-04f1cebf2b06","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15776424","rdfs:label":"P5","allele":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0febbd65-34ab-4918-b8ab-6ea98c6ba800","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001360.3(DHCR7):c.292C>T (p.Gln98Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/188723"}},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/31ba92c1-13d7-462f-af8c-1b6e5ab427e3","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001360.3(DHCR7):c.278C>T (p.Thr93Met)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA221665"}}],"detectionMethod":"High-molecular-weight DNA of the probands was isolated from peripheral blood leukocytes or fibroblasts with established procedures.

In DHCR7 KO models, \"the biochemical abnormalities mimic those of human SLOS patients,...all homozygous null animals die within hours of birth...To address the question of abnormal CNS function as a major contributor to the neonatal lethality, we reasoned that selective restoration of the Dhcr7 activity only in the neural compartment might abrogate this...We generated transgenic mice expressing human DHCR7 under the control of a CNS-specific nestin promoter. The original aim was to drive robust DHCR7 expression in the developing CNS tissues. Though transgene-specific DHCR7 expression was detected in mouse brain and in no other tissue by RT-PCR, this level of expression was very low and no signal for transgene expression was detectable by Northern analyses of brain RNA. However, this minimally expressed transgene in a Dhcr7 null background resulted in a partial rescue of neonatal lethality, although this rescue was stochastic. Rescued Dhcr7−/− pups (TgRKO) died between postnatal 3 and 17 days and showed severe growth retardation, had an abnormal gait, impaired movement suggestive of a neurological dysfunction, and biochemical analyses showed profound cholesterol deficiency in brain as well as in peripheral tissues. We report here a characterization of these rescued animals. Despite the stochastic nature of rescue, the few pups that survived allowed us to examine postnatal neural development in a mouse model of SLOS. Our results suggest that a major cause of lethality in the mouse models for SLOS is likely to be severely disrupted CNS development and that the cause of defect is likely to be more subtle than defect(s) resulting from loss of bulk cholesterol. Restoration of even a minimal amount of normal DHCR7 enzymatic activity was able to rescue neonatal lethality and allow for considerable, although insufficient, CNS development. Finally, despite the profound cholesterol deficiency in the knockout rescued pups, the total sterol levels were very comparable to normal littermates.\"\"","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15862627","rdfs:label":"Yu 2005","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:PhenotypeRescue"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanRescueCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c7db65e5-8489-481c-959d-8da28f76041f","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/13bb61bd-2fef-4ce1-a9b7-6a872d7009b8","type":"Finding","dc:description":"In patients with SLOS, there is decreased 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase protein expression and/or function.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9653161","rdfs:label":"Fitzy 1998","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCellCultureModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/633d66e1-ff3a-4e9f-8296-69290a86a5c9","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5cd28e7e-252a-4fd7-b334-a71b1368b8de","type":"Finding","dc:description":"A null mutation in the mouse Dhcr7 causes an identical biochemical defect to that seen in human SLOS patients, including markedly reduced tissue cholesterol and total sterol levels, and 30- to 40-fold elevated concentrations of 7-dehydrocholesterol.
