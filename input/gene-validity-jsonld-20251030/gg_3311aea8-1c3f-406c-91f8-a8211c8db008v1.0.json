{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3311aea8-1c3f-406c-91f8-a8211c8db008v1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"Variation in SCN2A was first reported in relation to complex neurodevelopmental disorder in 2001 (Sugawara et al., PMID 11371648); variants in affected individuals were observed in the heterozygous state (consistent with autosomal dominant mode of inheritance), though most cases are de novo. At least 98 variants (e.g. missense, nonsense, frameshift, splice site) have been reported in humans: 8 variants in individuals with infantile seizures and developmental delay, 51 variants in epileptic encephalopathy with infantile seizures and developmental delay, hypotonia, cerebral atrophy, 39 variants with developmental disorder or autism spectrum disorder/intellectual disability (Ben Shalom et al. 2017 PMID 28256214). Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, there is insufficient evidence of a difference in molecular mechanisms or inheritance pattern despite genotype:phenotype correlations that may explain the wide phenotypic spectrum observed from SCN2A variation (PMID 28256214, http://epilepsygenetics.net/2015/08/11/scn2a-this-is-what-you-need-to-know-in-2015/); therefore, we decided to curate all of these entities together under the umbrella term “complex neurodevelopmental disorder.”  Of note, this gene has also been implicated in benign infantile familial seizures (MONDO:0011140). These cases will be assessed in a separate curation. Evidence supporting the relationship between SCN2A and complex neurodevelopmental disorder includes case-level data and experimental data. For the purposes of this curation, 11 variants in this gene were scored in the following 8 publications: PMIDs 19786696, 23662938, 15028761, 30185235, 20956790, 24650168, 23935176, 22495306. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. Of note, both loss-of-function and gain-of-function of SCN2A have been observed in experiments with patient variants (PMIDs 28379373, 29867081).  This gene-disease association is supported by mouse models, functional alteration, and expression studies (PMIDs 24267886, 30144217, 28256214, 28379373, 29867081). In summary,  SCN2A variation is definitively associated with complex neurodevelopmental disorder. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Epilepsy Expert Panel on 5/7/2019 (SOP Version 6).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3311aea8-1c3f-406c-91f8-a8211c8db008","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2a1b7361-5c9e-4803-844d-ad6606a0acdb","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2a1b7361-5c9e-4803-844d-ad6606a0acdb_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10005","date":"2019-05-07T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2a1b7361-5c9e-4803-844d-ad6606a0acdb_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10005","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2a1b7361-5c9e-4803-844d-ad6606a0acdb_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2a1b7361-5c9e-4803-844d-ad6606a0acdb_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/26b67fc2-a2f0-450e-95fe-38d825c40ec4","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Gave the default mouse points as the mouse shows that alteration to the cortical-striatal neurons causes absence seizures and spike and wave discharges initiated by cortical excitatory transmission to the striatum.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2a7c2842-4878-4640-9898-9c3fbf342f4c","type":"Finding","dc:description":"patients with SCN2A variation have been identified to have epilepsy.

Seizures were refractory to various conventional\nmedications including valproate, phenobarbital, phenytoin,\nand clobazam. The seizure duration was for 10–20 seconds\nand the frequency of seizure attacks was 1 to 10 times per day,\nboth during sleep and awake, especially frequently when falling\nasleep and during afternoon nap. After age 10 years, seizures\nwere often triggered by fever above 37.5°C. No myoclonic seizures\nor absence seizures were observed.
