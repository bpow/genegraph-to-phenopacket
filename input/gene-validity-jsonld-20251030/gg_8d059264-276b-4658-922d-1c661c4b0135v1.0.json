Variants in BCS1L were first reported in humans with Leigh syndrome spectrum in 2001 (PMID: 11528392). Several pathogenic variants have been reported in ClinVar, and loss of function is the mechanism of disease for this gene. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. One proband with BCS1L  a homozygous pathogenic variant with Leigh syndrome spectrum has been reported in the 2001 publication (PMID: 11528392) to reach a case-level evidence score of 1.5. This gene-disease association is further supported by BCS1L protein interaction with other genes associated with Leigh syndrome spectrum, BCS1L expression in brain, mitochondrial alterations in patient cell lines, and a BCS1L mouse model exhibiting a neuropathological, biochemical, and developmental phenotype that recapitulates symptoms of Leigh syndrome spectrum reaching a experimental score of 5 pts. In summary, there is limited evidence to support the relationship between BCS1L and autosomal recessive Leigh syndrome spectrum. This classification was approved by the  NICHD U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on September 9, 2019 (SOP Version 7).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8d059264-276b-4658-922d-1c661c4b0135","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3b50d7db-1144-4187-a60c-72b45adb80bd","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3b50d7db-1144-4187-a60c-72b45adb80bd_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2019-09-19T15:53:15.896Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3b50d7db-1144-4187-a60c-72b45adb80bd_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"The recommendation is that at least 3 probands are needed for a gene-disease clinical validity classification to be \"Moderate\".","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3b50d7db-1144-4187-a60c-72b45adb80bd_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2604a4a1-b8bf-4e73-b4f3-8bb4ba2a5b08_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Functionality of mutations were assessed by utilizing complementation assays in a yeast model, specifically measuring complentation by assessing growth in glycerol and respiration in isolated mitochondria.
