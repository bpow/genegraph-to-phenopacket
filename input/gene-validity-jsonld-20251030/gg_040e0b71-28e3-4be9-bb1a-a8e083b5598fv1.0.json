MCCC1 encodes the alpha subunit of 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase, which is involved in the catabolism of leucine. Deficiency of MCCC1 is associated with increased urinary excretion of 3-hydroxyisovalerate & 3-methylcrotonylglycine, The clinical phenotype ranges from severe neurological abnormalities and death in infancy to asymptomatic. Variants in MCCC1 were ﬁrst reported in humans with this deﬁciency in 2001 (Gallardo et al., PMID: 11170888; Baumgartner et al., PMID: 11181649). At least 103 unique variants (missense, nonsense, frameshift, splicing, deletion) have been identiﬁed in humans (Cozzolino et al., 2018; PMID 29767664). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level and experimental data. This gene-disease relationship is supported by biochemical assays, expression studies, and in vitro studies. In summary, MCCC1 is deﬁnitively associated with autosomal recessive 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase deficiency. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/040e0b71-28e3-4be9-bb1a-a8e083b5598f","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6bd0c545-9ef8-4005-a124-a73be6178745","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6bd0c545-9ef8-4005-a124-a73be6178745_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10011","date":"2019-10-25T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6bd0c545-9ef8-4005-a124-a73be6178745_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10011","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6bd0c545-9ef8-4005-a124-a73be6178745_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6bd0c545-9ef8-4005-a124-a73be6178745_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2f64799d-ae71-40d3-866f-03f13c797b1a","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3702718d-186d-46b5-9db6-682f5be9e134","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Seven patients showed either elevated excretion of 3-methylcrotonylglycine or 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid or were found clinically to have elevated blood levels of C5-OH.
