However, these association studies, many of which were performed almost two decades ago, were underpowered, and their findings were not validated when larger samples were analyzed (2006, PMID: 16616719; meta-analysis 2008, PMID: 18286633). Several inherited missense variants identified in unrelated multiplex autism families and initially reported as rare (PMID: 15995945) are observed in gnomAD at high frequency and were not scored as evidence. Experimental evidence is available, including mouse models, but in the absence of human genetic evidence were not utilized in the scoring. In summary, there is no valid genetic evidence to support an association between SLC6A4 and autism spectrum disorder. Approved by the ClinGen ID/Autism Expert Panel 1/6/2021. Note that this gene-disease relationship was originally curated in May 2018 and given a Limited classification. Changes in scoring practices resulted in the classification being updated.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/709ccb86-9c3a-487b-a474-a46c7964ba77","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cc4b0612-0a53-4e36-b737-5c0f49a387a1","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"NoKnownDiseaseRelationship","changes":{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cc4b0612-0a53-4e36-b737-5c0f49a387a1_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2021-01-06T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cc4b0612-0a53-4e36-b737-5c0f49a387a1_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2021-02-11T13:07:25.366Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"Variants reported in association with autism spectrum disorder are present at high frequencies in population databases and thus were not counted as supporting evidence of this gene-disease relationship.","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cc4b0612-0a53-4e36-b737-5c0f49a387a1_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cc4b0612-0a53-4e36-b737-5c0f49a387a1_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/32870fd4-db7e-4d3e-a870-66ec601791b8","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Variants present at high frequencies in population databases.","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/31c128af-998e-436d-ba7f-19027a54ec31","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Ile425Leu; Phe465Leu; and Leu550Val.
