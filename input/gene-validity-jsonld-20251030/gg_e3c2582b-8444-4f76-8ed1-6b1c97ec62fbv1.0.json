Aiolos is a member of the Ikaros family; as a transcription factor, it can bind DNA in essential regions to control hematopoiesis and cell functions of immune cells. Immunodeficiency 84 or immunodeficiency due to IKZF3 deficiency (MONDO:0030333), is characterized by profound defects in B cell differentiation, and severe hypogammaglobulinemia in patients. A total of two missense variants have been reported in 7 patients in 2 publications only (PMID: 34155405, 34694366). The two variants: p.G159R and p.N160S were found in autosomal dominant traits. Experimental evidence includes loss of the ability to form pericentromeric heterochromatin foci in the dimer IKZF1-IKZF3 affecting the transcriptional activity of genes under IKZF3 regulation. Additionally, the Aiolos knock in mice evaluating the homologous variants for p.G159R, and p.N160S showed that mice have profound defects in B cell development and low immunoglobulin levels (IgG, IgM and IgA), which is consistent with the phenotype seen in patients.  \nIn summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship with only two variants identified in two publications.\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e3c2582b-8444-4f76-8ed1-6b1c97ec62fb","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e9112f2c-325e-4363-8a37-e7a8862bf55b","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e9112f2c-325e-4363-8a37-e7a8862bf55b_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10080","date":"2023-07-28T03:17:39.233Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e9112f2c-325e-4363-8a37-e7a8862bf55b_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10080","date":"2023-03-21T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e9112f2c-325e-4363-8a37-e7a8862bf55b_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8d8a8ffc-3697-467a-a8bb-1cfd549b58f3","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8d8a8ffc-3697-467a-a8bb-1cfd549b58f3_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) confirmed that IKZF3 variant p.G159R loses the ability to bind DNA.
