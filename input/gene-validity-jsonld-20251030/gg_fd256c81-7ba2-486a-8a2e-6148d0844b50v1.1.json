Variants in SLC6A8, which encodes the creatine transporter (CT1, CRTR, CRT) were first reported in individuals with cerebral creatine deficiency in 2001 (Salomons et al, PMID: 11326334). Clinical symptoms in affected males include intellectual disability with little or no speech, seizures, autistic behaviors, and movement disorder. Heterozygous females have highly variable presentation ranging from no clinical symptoms, to mild language disability, to seizures and intellectual disability. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy reveals reduced or absent creatine in the brain. In affected males, urine creatine is markedly elevated but it can be normal in heterozygous females. Data from 11 probands (9 male, 2 female) with 11 unique variants (missense, nonsense, frameshift, splice site) were curated from 10 publications (Salomons et al, 2001, PMID 11326334; Hahn et al, 2002, PMID 11898126; Rosenberg et al, 2004, PMID 15154114; Shiaffino et al, 2005, PMID 16086185; Póo-Argüelles et al, 2006, PMID 16601898; Battini et al, 2007, PMID 17603797; Anselm et al, 2008, PMID 18443316; Fons et al, 2009, PMID 19706062; Mercimek-Mahmutoglu et al, 2010, PMID 20846889; Betsalel et al, 2011, PMID 20717164). Segregation was demonstrated in one curated family, with a LOD score of 2.4 (Hahn et al, 2002, PMID 11898126). More case-level information is available in the published literature but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points has been reached). This gene disease relationship is supported by the biochemical function of the creatine transporter which is consistent with the finding of cerebral creatine deficiency in patients (Guimbal et al, 1993, PMID 8473283; Braissant et al, 2010, PMID 19879361); the knowledge that variants in genes involved in creatine synthesis (GATM, which encodes arginine-glycine amidinotransferase, and GAMT, which encodes guanidinoacetate methyltransferase) are definitively associated with cerebral creatine deficiency and result in similar symptoms to SLC6A8 deficiency (Boorsook et al, 1940, PMID 17789505; Cantoni et al, 1954, PMID 13192118); rescue of creatine transport in SLC6A8-deficient fibroblasts by SLC6A8 cDNA (Rosenberg et al, 2006, PMID 16763899) and failure of missense variants to correct creatine transport ability of SLC6A8-deficient cells (Betsalel et al, 2012, PMID 20717164); and the clinical and biochemical symptoms in ubiquitous and brain-specific mouse models (Skelton et al, 2011, PMID 21249153; Baroncelli et al, 2014, PMID 25485098; Kurosawa et al, 2012, PMID 22751104). More experimental evidence to support this gene-disease relationship is available in the published literature but the maximum score for experimental evidence (6 points) has been reached. In summary, SLC6A8 is definitively associated with creatine transporter deficiency. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This clinical validity classification was approved by the ClinGen Aminoacidopathy Gene Curation Expert Panel.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fd256c81-7ba2-486a-8a2e-6148d0844b50","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3795f0ae-7668-47b8-b69e-9c686b82bd0a","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"},"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3795f0ae-7668-47b8-b69e-9c686b82bd0a_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10011","date":"2020-09-16T19:23:02.870Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3795f0ae-7668-47b8-b69e-9c686b82bd0a_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10011","date":"2020-02-10T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3795f0ae-7668-47b8-b69e-9c686b82bd0a_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3795f0ae-7668-47b8-b69e-9c686b82bd0a_seg_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/01abd225-3215-4d5f-8415-d850b230d331_proband_segregation","type":"FamilyCosegregation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11898126","rdfs:label":"Family K8085","family":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/01abd225-3215-4d5f-8415-d850b230d331","type":"Family","rdfs:label":"Family K8085","ethnicity":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/"},"member":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b94dfb2d-01d1-48ab-b627-1b1fb1610e2d","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11898126","rdfs:label":"K8085: II-5","ageType":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/","ageUnit":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/","detectionMethod":"PCR amplification of SLC6A8 cDNA from lymphoblasts revealed the expected sized band (250 bp) and a smaller band (237 bp) that was absent in the control sample but present in this patient and the other 2 affected family members analyzed.

(For a review, please see PMIDs 12701824 and 20301745).\nRegarding the function of arginine:glycine amidinotransferase (AGAT),  Borsook and Dubnoff (1941) showed that kidney slices form a significant amount of guanidinoacetate when arginine is added. Glycine without arginine also leads to a slight increase in glycocyamine. When both amino acids are added, the increase in glycocyamine is more than 10 times the increase with arginine alone (Table I). The activity was named “glycine-transamidinase”, now known as arginine-glycine amidinotransferase (AGAT). Glycine-transamidinase activity was found in the kidney and cell-free extract of every animal tested except the frog (Table VI). By feeding N15-labeled glycine or arginine to rats, it was shown that guanidinoacetate is formed by the transfer of the amidine group from arginine to glycine. The rates of guanidinoacetate formation were estimated to be sufficient to replace creatine lost from tissues (and excreted as creatinine). Therefore, AGAT catalyzes the first step in creatine synthesis.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17789505","rdfs:label":"Role of AGAT in creatine synthesis","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionA"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cebadac7-5452-4c5e-9eb7-c2c64ec60497","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/059ce78c-3719-4566-a4d5-898e0b67a3a1","type":"Finding","dc:description":"GAMT encodes guanidinoacetate methyltransferase, the enzyme catalyzing the second step in creatine synthesis.

This is the second and final step of creatine synthesis. Based on previous studies, it was known that the last step of creatine biosynthesis involves the methylation of guanidinoacetate. It was also known that the methyl group in creatine is derived from L-methionine, and that ATP and Mg++ are required. A soluble enzyme catalyzing S-adenosylmethionine + guanidinoacetate -> S-adenosylhomocysteine + creatine was found in cell-free extracts of guinea pig, rabbit, beef, and pig liver. The enzyme from pig liver was purified, approximately 20-fold. Using this partially purified enzyme, a linear relationship was observed between the formation of creatine from S-adenosylmethionine + guanidinoacetate, and the amount of the enzyme. Creatine was conclusively identified as one of the products of the enzymatic reaction by determination of its chemical nature, the ability of the reaction product to function as a substrate for creatine kinase, and the finding of creatinine (a breakdown product of creatine) in the reaction.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/13192118","rdfs:label":"GAMT role in creatine synthesis","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionA"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/be6d9819-94e8-48da-a8c5-797e040ef4a2","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/13f64373-b038-469c-bb14-aa926a77553c","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Prior to this study, the expression pattern of SLC6A8 in brain had suggested thus that the blood brain barrier has a limited permeability for creatine. Further work had shown that the two enzymes involved in creatine synthesis (AGAT ad GAMT), are expressed within the CNS. This suggested that creatine synthesis should be able to occur within this brain and led to the question of why patients with SLC6A8 have cerebral creatine deficiency. Using in situ hybridization and immunlocalization, the authors showed that <20% of rat CNS cells co-express AGAT and GAMT. Radiolabeled guanidinoacetate was shown to be converted to creatine by reaggregated brain cell cultures and, furthermore, guanidinoacetate uptake was competed by creatine. This suggested that, in most brain regions, guanidinoacetate is transported from AGAT- to GAMT-expressing cells through SLC6A8 to allow creatine synthesis, thereby explaining creatine deficiency in SLC6A8-deficient CNS. These observations are also consistent with the findings that creatine level can be normal or only mildly reduced in the CSF of patients with SLC6A8 deficiency (due to some level of creatine synthesis) and that some patients with SLC6A8 deficiency have been reported with increased levels of GAA in their brain, presumably due to the absence of a functional SLC6A8 to complete the Cr synthetic pathway (see PMID 26861125 for review).","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19879361","rdfs:label":"Transport of guanidinoacetate in brain","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3795f0ae-7668-47b8-b69e-9c686b82bd0a_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f6a698c5-dc2e-4136-ab5a-0a4dd54a2d98","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7cdc28a4-5e87-4fec-9c20-3558dc7c8271","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"21 missense variants, previously identified in SLC6A8 in patients referred for diagnostic testing (reason for referral unknown) were introduced into wild tpe SLC6A8 cDNA by site-directed mutagenesis and expressed in SLC6A8-deficient fibroblasts.
