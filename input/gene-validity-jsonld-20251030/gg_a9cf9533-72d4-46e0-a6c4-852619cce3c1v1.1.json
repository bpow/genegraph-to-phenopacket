Alport syndrome is characterized by hearing loss, anterior lenticonus, and glomerular basement membrane defects that may progress to end-stage kidney disease. Patients often present with hematuria and worsening proteinuria. Kidney biopsy may identify focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and thin glomerular basement membranes with abnormal ultrastructure. Autosomal dominant inheritance has also been reported, leading to an isolated renal phenotype of hematuria, with or without structural changes and progressive disease course. Case reports of digenic inheritance with *COL4A4* or *COL4A5* variants also exist. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in molecular mechanism between the reported disease entities and noted that affected families show phenotypic variability with variable expressivity. Therefore, the following disease entities have been lumped into a single disease entity, Alport syndrome 3, autosomal dominant (OMIM:104200), Alport syndrome 2, autosomal recessive (OMIM:203780) and Hematuria, benign familial (OMIM:141200). The preferred disease name suggested for this grouping of disorders is ‘Alport Spectrum - *COL4A3*’. Twenty three variants (missense, nonsense, frameshift) that have been reported in 17 probands in 4 publications (PMID: 33532864, PMID: 33838161, PMID: 26346198, PMID: 7987396 ) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is known to be loss-of-function. This gene-disease association is also supported by animal models (PMID: 32743880, PMID: 16775036, PMID: 33718859, PMID: 14507670), expression studies (PMID: 33718859, PMID: 28495876), and *in vitro* functional assays (PMID: 24262798, PMID: 14633121). In summary, *COL4A3* is definitively associated with Alport Spectrum. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a9cf9533-72d4-46e0-a6c4-852619cce3c1","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e1ed7d3b-4366-4f4a-98f2-80e431e2d8da","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":[{"id":"cg:classificationChange"},{"id":"cg:newEvidence"},{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e1ed7d3b-4366-4f4a-98f2-80e431e2d8da_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10068","date":"2021-07-26T02:30:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e1ed7d3b-4366-4f4a-98f2-80e431e2d8da_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10068","date":"2022-04-13T06:24:16.325Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e1ed7d3b-4366-4f4a-98f2-80e431e2d8da_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e1ed7d3b-4366-4f4a-98f2-80e431e2d8da_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9801d404-b708-40bb-aab8-eb54903e8015","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2e0a0c98-6286-4abe-9c80-35f9fcc6d15b","type":"Finding","dc:description":"https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000169031-COL4A3/tissue/kidney#img","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28495876","rdfs:label":"COL4A3 expression in the kidney","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7c72b5b0-3a8e-47f8-b9b3-56292ce8cdac","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/400fa487-d913-48d1-8d7c-c6cc7b3fe2fb","type":"Finding","dc:description":"The alpha3(IV) and alpha4(IV) chains were coimmunoprecipitated with the alpha5(IV) chain in alpha345 cells but not in alpha35 and alpha45 cells.
