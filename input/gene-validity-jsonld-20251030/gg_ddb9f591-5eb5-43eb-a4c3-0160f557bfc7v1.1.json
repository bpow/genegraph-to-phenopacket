{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ddb9f591-5eb5-43eb-a4c3-0160f557bfc7v1.1","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"The relationship between *COX14* and primary mitochondrial disease was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of March 21, 2022. The *COX14* gene encodes a Complex IV, or cytochrome c oxidase (COX) assembly factor and is also involved in translation of *MT-CO1*, the gene encoding the COX1 subunit of the enzyme.\n\nThe *COX14* gene has been reported in relation to autosomal recessive primary mitochondrial disease in a single family in a single publication in 2012 (PMID: 22243966). While various names have been given to the constellation of features seen in those with *COX14*-related disease, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *COX14* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. While segregation data were considered, the LOD score (1.68) did not meet criteria to be scored per the ClinGen Gene Curation SOP V8 (PMID: 22243966). This curation included one homozygous variant identified in one proband in one publication (PMID: 22243966). Affected individuals in this family had a severe lactic acidosis and died shortly after birth.  Loss of function is suspected to be the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease association is also supported by known biochemical function, functional alteration in patient cells, functional alteration in non-patient cells, and rescue in patient cells (PMID: 22243966).\n\nIn summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on March 21, 2022 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ddb9f591-5eb5-43eb-a4c3-0160f557bfc7","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8899dbb6-9769-4d93-83fb-e95b6775962c","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","changes":{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8899dbb6-9769-4d93-83fb-e95b6775962c_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2022-03-21T04:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8899dbb6-9769-4d93-83fb-e95b6775962c_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2022-10-11T21:51:47.586Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8899dbb6-9769-4d93-83fb-e95b6775962c_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8899dbb6-9769-4d93-83fb-e95b6775962c_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/37606c41-6c22-4b97-8b2d-1c8d6f293f3f","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":">10 genes with shared function","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2dea0b57-54c9-42e9-9b7e-ea4ea21f6578","type":"Finding","dc:description":"extensive studies showing C12orf62 couples synthesis of COX I with subsequent assembly of the nascent subunits into the holoenzyme complex; translator activator and then assembly factor","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22243966","rdfs:label":"Complex IV assembly factor","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionA"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8899dbb6-9769-4d93-83fb-e95b6775962c_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/15cf5482-1e05-463a-817c-368c3eb05226","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"siRNAs for transient knockdown of C12orf62 in control fibroblasts resulted in both a COX-assembly defect similar to that seen in the subject (Figure 4A) and reduced COX activity (38%–53% of control activity) that correlated with the severity of the assembly defect","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/53696b1d-1a91-4026-8588-1c96df686d11","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Resulted in both a COX-assembly defect similar to that seen in the subject (Figure 4A) and reduced COX activity (38%–53% of control activity) that correlated with the severity of the assembly defect.

In the subject cells, although COX I was synthesized at ~25% of control levels, the newly synthesized protein was completely stable. This contrasted with COX II and COX III, whose turnover was much faster than in control cells (Figure 6B).\n\n------\nThen did BN page to see how newly synthesized mtDNA-encoded subunits are incorporated into holoenzyme complex (Figure 7).  In control cells, COX I is incorporated into two complexes, one corresponding to the fully assembled holoenzyme (S4) and another lower-molecular-weight complex corresponding to an intermediate assembly complex (S3). A similar pattern was observed in the subject cells: COX I stability appeared normal in the fully assembled complex but slightly decreased in the assembly intermediate. By contrast, newly synthesized COX II and III were less efficiently incorporated into the COX complex, and they were rapidly turned over after a long chase.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22243966","rdfs:label":"Pulse labelling of mitochondrial translation products"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8899dbb6-9769-4d93-83fb-e95b6775962c_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/39df4477-d8eb-48b1-83da-63c02ddd797d","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"0.5 for rescuing COX assembly defect;
