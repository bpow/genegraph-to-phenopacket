It encodes for the fat storage-inducing transmembrane protein 2, embedded in the wall of the endoplasmic reticulum where they regulate lipid droplet formation in the cytosol.\n*FITM2 *was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Siddiqi syndrome (SIDDIS) in 2017 (Zazo Seco et al., PMID: 28067622). This disease is caused by homozygous or compound heterozygous mutation in the *FITM2* gene. The associated phenotypes involve the nervous system and musculature including hypotonia, global developmental delay, poor fine motor skills, impaired intellectual development, and sensorineural hearing impairment. More variable features may include ichthyosis-like skin abnormalities or sensory neuropathy. Around 5 unique variants (e.g., nonsense, frameshift, and missense) have been reported in at least 4 probands in various publications (PMID: 28067622, 30214770, 30288795, 35754111). A LOF nonsense variant was also found to segregate with the disorder in additional family members with a LOD score of 4.00 (PMID: 28067622). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. This gene-disease association is also supported by experimental evidence in Drosophila (animal model) where RNAi-induced gene downregulation of *Fitm* gene resulted in severely impaired and uncoordinated locomotion along with sensory neuropathy, thus recapitulating the phenotypic features of Siddiqi syndrome (PMID: 28067622). Symptomatic evidence for dyskinetic cerebral palsy has also been reported in one of the probands (PMID: 30214770).\n \nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship of the *FITM2* gene with Siddiqi syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in research and clinical diagnostic settings and upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Cerebral Palsy Gene Curation Expert Panel on 17/10/2022 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0edcb12e-0bd5-4fe1-85f9-0c5710af32e0","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0a18aeda-fbe1-49b3-9542-6402ea61b4c0","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0a18aeda-fbe1-49b3-9542-6402ea61b4c0_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10113","date":"2022-10-31T20:59:56.913Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0a18aeda-fbe1-49b3-9542-6402ea61b4c0_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10113","date":"2022-10-17T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0a18aeda-fbe1-49b3-9542-6402ea61b4c0_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8cb62044-cfd1-44b9-afa2-03eae2353e5b_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/456c0c44-5a23-4ca2-944c-25669115dd10","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":3.0,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/456c0c44-5a23-4ca2-944c-25669115dd10_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35754111","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9f32186a-f1b1-433b-8d07-bb085166a788","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001080472.4(FITM2):c.611_612dup (p.Met205Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA9869565"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":3.0},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8cb62044-cfd1-44b9-afa2-03eae2353e5b","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35754111","rdfs:label":"Lin, Yunting 1y6m girl","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":18,"allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9f32186a-f1b1-433b-8d07-bb085166a788"},"detectionMethod":"Whole exome sequencing of the proband-parent trio was performed using Agilent Sure Select Human All Exon V6 kit and Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform.

The single homozygous 8.4 Mb region on chromosome 20q12–q13.2 was fully covered in the enrichment kit. In the linkage region, only non-synonymous exonic and canonical splice-site variants were selected that occurred with a frequency of less than 5% in the 1000 genomes and HapMap populations, and that were homozygous in both affected siblings and heterozygous in the parents. This revealed a single homozygous nonsense mutation in the second codon, c.4G>T (p.Glu2*, NM_001080472.1), of FITM2 that cosegregated in the family with the disease. This FITM2 c.4G>T variant was neither present in 274 Pakistani control alleles nor in whole-genome or -exome databases. In order to exclude other potentially causative variants, especially in genomic regions with a LOD score ≥−2, we selected all variants with a MAF (minor allele frequency) <5% that were heterozygous in the parents and compound heterozygous or homozygous in both affected siblings.
