A missense variant reported in an individual with CHD was included in this curation (PMID: 24039762). There are more variants reported in individuals with CHD in two publications, all of which were synonymous variants that were not scored due to either low SpliceAI scores or high minor allele frequency (>0.00001) on gnomAD v.4 (PMID: 24039762, 28078173). This gene-disease relationship is also supported by expression data in mouse embryos and 2 mouse models showing heart defects (PMID: 18952608). In summary, there is limited evidence supporting the relationship between *SMAD7* and autosomal dominant congenital heart disease. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Congenital Heart Disease GCEP on the meeting date May 13th, 2024 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c4059690-da11-43ab-ad8e-257689c535fb","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0d9050fb-dd82-4fa9-aa2d-ef4b9f13f6b2","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0d9050fb-dd82-4fa9-aa2d-ef4b9f13f6b2_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10130","date":"2024-06-11T19:18:44.298Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0d9050fb-dd82-4fa9-aa2d-ef4b9f13f6b2_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10130","date":"2024-05-13T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0d9050fb-dd82-4fa9-aa2d-ef4b9f13f6b2_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0d9050fb-dd82-4fa9-aa2d-ef4b9f13f6b2_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/47d5d396-0472-4e4f-afd2-44541ff829b5","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Downgraded as inheritance pattern does not match human cases","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ed4eabb6-2ec1-4ddd-b173-70c80a9322fe","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Pre-migratory Smad7 induction attenuates both TGFβ and BMP signaling by suppressing R-Smad phosphorylation, resulting in elevated NCC death, diminished NCC colonization of craniofacial, pharyngeal, cardiac tissues, dysregulated epithelial-mesenchymal interactions and in utero lethality.
