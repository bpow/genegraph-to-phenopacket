Variants in *SPEF2* had also been previously identified in individuals affected with multiple morphologic abnormalities of the flagella (PMID: 31151990) and asserted as a monogenic cause of spermatogenic failure 43 (MIM#: 618751). Probands diagnosed with spermatogenic failure displayed male infertility and reduced sperm motility, often without reported details of respiratory examinations, but sometimes in the confirmed absence of respiratory features (PMID: 31048344). Those diagnosed with primary ciliary dyskinesia exhibited respiratory symptoms including chronic rhinitis or sinusitis, bronchiectasis, productive/wet cough, and otitis media, in addition to infertility and reduced sperm motility (PMID: 31942643). Per the recommendations of the ClinGen Lumping & Splitting Working Group, the GCEP found consistencies between the mode of inheritance (autosomal recessive) and molecular mechanism (biallelic SPEF2 loss-of-function) between patients diagnosed with either infertility or primary ciliary dyskinesia, while their overlapping phenotypes formed a single spectrum that included both infertility and respiratory features. As. a result, the GCEP recommended lumping of all SPEF2-related cases into a single gene curation under the broader disease entity primary ciliary dyskinesia (MONDO:0016575).\n\nThis curation includes eleven variants (six frameshift, three nonsense, one missense, and one splice site) that have been reported in eight probands in five publications (PMIDs: 36615117, 31545650, 36873931, 31942643, 31048344). Overall, the mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be biallelic loss-of-function. \n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by multiple forms of experimental evidence ranging from expression to animal models (PMIDs: 31545650 and 21715716). PCD probands with *HYDIN* variants show SPEF2 expression / localization defects by immunofluorescence (PMID: 31545650). In addition, the mouse \"big giant head\" (bgh) model with homozygous *Spef2* disruption is characterized not only by hydrocephalus but also male infertility, abnormal ciliary motility, sinusitis and reduced respiratory ciliary beating frequency, which recapitulated the phenotypes found in human probands (PMID: 21715716).\n\nIn conclusion, *SPEF2* is definitively associated with primary ciliary dyskinesia. This classification has been clearly demonstrated and confirmed through both experimental and genetic evidence and has been upheld over time without the emergence of contradictory evidence. This classification was approved by the Motile Ciliopathy GCEP on January 9th, 2025 (SOP Version 11).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6ab3c62a-67c9-44dd-b801-bd6139a32f09","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e137eed5-fcd8-4497-a6dc-6651062d1cf3","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e137eed5-fcd8-4497-a6dc-6651062d1cf3_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10102","date":"2025-01-09T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e137eed5-fcd8-4497-a6dc-6651062d1cf3_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10102","date":"2025-02-19T20:13:37.882Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e137eed5-fcd8-4497-a6dc-6651062d1cf3_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e137eed5-fcd8-4497-a6dc-6651062d1cf3_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1eb9563a-4a1f-4fb9-8635-22130e95a194","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a7ca479c-2cb8-4f83-905d-a7934665ed9e","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Both the model and human probands  were found to have male infertility, abnormal ciliary motility, sinusitis and reduced respiratory ciliary beating frequency.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21715716","rdfs:label":"Sironen et al. 2011","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e137eed5-fcd8-4497-a6dc-6651062d1cf3_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6e815af7-b2f4-4a7e-bd5e-d17cbe46d4ee","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2366addb-c20e-4bff-b327-c9cbeb658087","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Table 1 has 15 probands with HYDIN variants that found SPEF2 with IF.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31545650","rdfs:label":"Cindrić et al. 2020","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionB"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e137eed5-fcd8-4497-a6dc-6651062d1cf3_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c3616c16-61b8-4fda-be7f-799d345d9f63_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/05b65325-3fe3-445d-aa73-ca3f7610efc0","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/05b65325-3fe3-445d-aa73-ca3f7610efc0_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"Proband had functional evidence: In sperm cells of the proband, a severe reduction of the SPEF2 signal or no signal against SPEF2 was observed along the flagellar axoneme and the sperm of the SPEF2-mutant individual display a MMAF phenotype with short, bent, coiled and irregular flagella.

Electron microscopy revealed no apparent structural abnormalities.\n\nAt 13 years of age, the patient was diagnosed with sinobronchial syndrome and received long-term macrolide therapy. At the age of 25 years, the patient was referred to our hospital, and a nasal biopsy for the diagnosis of PCD was performed; however, no cilia were found in the tissue, and the result did not reach the level of diagnosis. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was detected in the patient’s sputum at the age of 25 years. Repeats of acute bronchiectasis exacerbations and a gradual decline in respiratory function were also shown. At 39 years of age, home oxygen therapy was initiated, and registration on a waiting list for lung transplants from brain-dead donors was applied for. The pulmonary function test results at the age of 39 years were as follows: forced vital capacity, 2.27 L (78.5% of the predicted value); forced expiratory volume in 1 s, 1.18 L (43.4% of the predicted value); and carbon monoxide diffusion capacity of the lung, 16.5 mL/min/mmHg (83.0% of the predicted value). The fraction of exhaled nitric oxide levels was low (5 ppb; the mean levels of Japanese individuals are approximately 15 ppb). Chest radiography (Figure 1) revealed diffuse nodules, consolidation, and bronchial wall thickening, predominantly in the lower lung fields.\n\nChest high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) revealed diffuse bronchial wall thickening, bronchial dilatation, and mucus plugs with predominant bilateral middle and lower lung fields (Figure 2a–c). A sinus computed tomography (CT) scan showed fluid retention and mucosal thickening occupying the right maxillary sinus, suggesting chronic sinusitis (Figure 2d).\n\nThe ciliary beat frequency (CBF), ciliary beat amplitude (CBA) (assessed by protractor, Figure S1), and ciliary coordination were immediately (within 10–30 min) assessed using cells obtained by nasal mucosal brushing with a high-speed video camera (HAS-L1, DITECT, Tokyo, Japan). One cell in five movies, five cells in total, of each right and left nostril was assessed in the medium (1:1 bronchial epithelial cell growth medium and Dulbecco’s modified eagle medium) [10]. Videos attached to a microscope were recorded at high speeds (more than 100 fps) and were replayed more slowly (5–30 fps) for evaluation using software (HAS-X viewer Ver.1.3.5.0., DITECT). The right median CBF and CBA were 4.63 Hz and 80 degrees, respectively, and the left median CBF and CBA were 2.75 Hz and 50 degrees, respectively, suggesting moderate deterioration of cilia function at the levels of our laboratory data.\n\nElectron microscopy did not reveal any obvious structural abnormalities in cilia (Figure 4), and genetic testing showed no variants in cystic fibrosis-related genes.","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0031245","obo:HP_0000246","obo:HP_0002110"],"sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7b222f07-6ac0-460e-9ace-2bbe279fa723_variant_evidence_item"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2a2b5fef-c032-45b3-80a2-1e53e269fc86_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/20270d5f-4415-4b8f-b14f-6d73f4ab4e12","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Downscored due to consanguinity and homozygosity","calculatedScore":3.0,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/20270d5f-4415-4b8f-b14f-6d73f4ab4e12_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31942643","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bfa930e1-0d51-487d-9813-4bf9d0d403bb","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_024867.4(SPEF2):c.2507+5del","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA916082697"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2a2b5fef-c032-45b3-80a2-1e53e269fc86","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31942643","rdfs:label":"F1: II-2","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bfa930e1-0d51-487d-9813-4bf9d0d403bb"},"detectionMethod":"WES","phenotypeFreeText":"The proband comes from a consanguineous family.\n\nThe proband was noted to have recurrent airway infections, bronchiectasis, rhinosinusitis, otitis media.
