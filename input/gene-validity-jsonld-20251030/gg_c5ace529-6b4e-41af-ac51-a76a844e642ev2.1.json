At least 8 variants (7 missense, 1 in-frame indel) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation includes 8 variants in 12 probands reported in 4 publications (PMIDs: 25795793, 26173643, 30707178, 32788663). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is gain of function (PMID: 26173643). This gene-disease association is also supported by experimental evidence demonstrating that SOS2 is involved in the Ras/MAPK pathway, which is associated with the NS phenotype (PMIDs: 26446362, 26173643, 10938118, 23875798). Of note, the ClinGen RASopathy Expert Panel found no published evidence associating SOS2 with Costello syndrome, cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome, NS with multiple lentigines, or NS with loose anagen hair. In summary, SOS2 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant Noonan syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This curation was approved by the ClinGen RASopathy Gene Curation Expert Panel on 8/27/20 (SOP Version 7).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c5ace529-6b4e-41af-ac51-a76a844e642e","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f20a1034-e29d-49bb-aed9-b4ba63dc5968","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/20786811-ea4c-4fa2-bd2e-6fc8477f1178_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10021","date":"2021-02-26T15:31:06.125Z","role":"Unpublisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f20a1034-e29d-49bb-aed9-b4ba63dc5968_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10021","date":"2021-02-26T15:31:06.125Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f20a1034-e29d-49bb-aed9-b4ba63dc5968_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10021","date":"2020-08-27T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f20a1034-e29d-49bb-aed9-b4ba63dc5968_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f20a1034-e29d-49bb-aed9-b4ba63dc5968_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/be262570-aba4-4615-8827-d595d91f8412","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The RAS/MAPK signalling pathway is assoicated with Noonan syndrome","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/31e9bd21-6650-4e3f-9634-ad30c770e470","type":"Finding","dc:description":"SOS2 is an established gene in the RAS/MAPK pathway","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23875798","rdfs:label":"SOS2 RAS/MAPK pathway","demonstrates":{"id":"obo:MI_0915"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/def73eb5-2044-48d7-8932-8c64dbf2299a","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Doesn't provide NS specific evidence","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bcc3266a-83a7-41cc-949e-cdf2608ef969","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Gain of function of both genes results in increased ERK and MEK phosphorylation and also increased GTP-bound RAS.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26173643","rdfs:label":"Cordeddu_2","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionA"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f20a1034-e29d-49bb-aed9-b4ba63dc5968_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d5c1c061-682c-4375-971d-78b91dd6b2d5","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Doesn't provide NS specific evidence.","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/029c8b46-3769-40ab-8de0-8a6c96313d62","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Stable expression of the constructs resulted in more GTP-bound RAS.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26173643","rdfs:label":"Cordeddu_1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f20a1034-e29d-49bb-aed9-b4ba63dc5968_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/150399a1-3799-4530-ac6d-83ee36045413","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"There was no difference from control mice in lifespan, histology of 30 tissues, fertility, or development.
