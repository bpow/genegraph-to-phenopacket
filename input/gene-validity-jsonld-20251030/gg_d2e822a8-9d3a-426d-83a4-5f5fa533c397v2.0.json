Three missense variants that have been reported in four probands in four publications are included in this curation (PMIDs: 23345450, 24211385, 29986705, 34425661). The hearing loss in these families had a postlingual onset, was progressive, and co-occurred with tinnitus in one family. An additional family was reported in which hearing loss co occurred with a mitochondrial disorder, however there wasn't strong evidence in support of pathogenicity of the P2RX2 variant for this phenotype and the variant was present in gnomAD (25788561). Functional evidence suggests a dominant negative mechanism (23345450). Substantial experimental evidence suggests that the P2RX2 receptor modulates a temporary threshold shift that protects the cochlea from overstimulation by loud noise exposure (23592720). This gene-disease relationship is also supported by animal models, expression studies, and in vitro functional assays (PMIDs: 23345450, 33791800, 23592720, 18491132). Loss of the P2RX2 receptor in mice increases susceptibility to noise-induced hearing loss, and a significant correlation was found in a large Chinese family between noise exposure during adolescence and severity of hearing loss (PMIDs: 23345450, 33791800). In summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged. This gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the Hearing Loss GCEP on 02/20/2018. It was reevaluated on 09/21/2022. Although a new case with hearing loss (29986705) and a new knock-in mouse model with progressive hearing loss (33791800) were scored, the classification did not change (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d2e822a8-9d3a-426d-83a4-5f5fa533c397","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c1dae6b6-4ed7-4c5a-ba4e-bcfaba026be8","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","changes":[{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},{"id":"cg:sopChange"},{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"},{"id":"cg:newEvidence"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c1dae6b6-4ed7-4c5a-ba4e-bcfaba026be8_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2023-01-24T18:37:32.904Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c1dae6b6-4ed7-4c5a-ba4e-bcfaba026be8_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2022-09-21T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c1dae6b6-4ed7-4c5a-ba4e-bcfaba026be8_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c1dae6b6-4ed7-4c5a-ba4e-bcfaba026be8_seg_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/02d29272-ea74-4dcb-b6e5-718c5c7f9c45_proband_segregation","type":"FamilyCosegregation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24211385","rdfs:label":"Faletra Family","family":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/02d29272-ea74-4dcb-b6e5-718c5c7f9c45","type":"Family","rdfs:label":"Faletra Family","member":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/98fd1a90-0d23-4d93-ab88-81c7467b7037","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24211385","rdfs:label":"Faletra Proband","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/15285c95-9f06-4034-95d6-8fc1d06ff965","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_170682.4(P2RX2):c.1057G>C (p.Gly353Arg)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/155763"}},"detectionMethod":"Sequencing of only P2RX2","firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"Progressive HL, onset in second decade of life.
