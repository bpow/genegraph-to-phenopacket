{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/669b9633-16e1-45bb-ab8e-4d74acb09c17v1.1","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"The actin-like protein 6A (ACTL6A) gene is located on chromosome 3 at 3q26 and encodes BRG1-associated factor A, a widely expressed regulatory subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex, which functions in cellular differentiation (Bao et al., 2013, PMID: 23395444). ACTL6A was first reported in relation to a neurodevelopmental disorder with dysmorphic features in 2017 (Marom et al., PMID: 28649782).  This disorder is characterized by intellectual disability or developmental delay as well as clinical features that include intrauterine growth retardation and failure to thrive in infancy, facial dysmorphisms, digital and urogenital anomalies, and cardiac defects (PMID 28649782). Five variants (1 frameshift, 1 splice-site, and 3 missense variants) have been reported in six cases across four publications (PMID: 28649782; Pascolini et al. 2020, PMID: 31994175; Chen et al. 2021, PMID: 34906496; Yuan et al. 2021, PMID: 34485408) and are included in this curation. The ACTL6A gene is intolerant to loss-of-function variation. The mechanism of pathogenicity is reported to be loss of function. This gene-disease association is supported by expression and biochemical function, and rescue in a non-human model data (Braun et al. 2021, PMID: 33602870). Homozygous deletion of the mouse homologue (Actl6a) results in early embryonic lethality (Krasteva et al. 2012, PMID: 23018638), while a conditional knockout mouse model demonstrates stalled cell cycle progression, resulting in cell death and disruption of appropriate neuronal cell differentiation (PMID: 33602870). \nIn summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged. This definitive classification was approved by the ClinGen Syndromic Disorders GCEP in the meeting on July 21, 2023 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/669b9633-16e1-45bb-ab8e-4d74acb09c17","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9278e3c0-9174-4aed-8c13-b34618e88825","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9278e3c0-9174-4aed-8c13-b34618e88825_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10060","date":"2024-01-22T21:21:29.307Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9278e3c0-9174-4aed-8c13-b34618e88825_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10060","date":"2023-07-21T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9278e3c0-9174-4aed-8c13-b34618e88825_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9278e3c0-9174-4aed-8c13-b34618e88825_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/91e1a770-5bd6-4b47-b62d-7ef5a789476d","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"expression may not explain all the other clinical features","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/92476b67-80d7-4257-814c-3f6c47057acc","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Baf53a is enriched in Sox2-expressing radial glia & TBR2-expressing intermediate progenitor cells in the ventricular & subventricular zones of the mouse embryonic cortex\nBAF53a is restricted to the neural progenitors; BAF45a & BAF53a is confined to the proliferated regions (part of the neural progenitor-specific complex, npBAF)\nThe switch to BAF53b & BAF45b/c is considered the postmitotic neuron-specific complex & is expressed in differentiated zones\n","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33602870","rdfs:label":"Mouse Model","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.25},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3ab7e785-d9ab-4115-a61c-f1dac86dfddf","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"genes within the BAF complex have been largely implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/98f05925-8ceb-4654-94ed-34ced4280512","type":"Finding","dc:description":"above genes are implicated in similar diseases and are part of the BAF complex","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32873422","rdfs:label":"BAF Complex","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionA"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1.25},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9278e3c0-9174-4aed-8c13-b34618e88825_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/107617ac-93ed-4c20-a72d-ec9f33aa0f51","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ee9f4f59-2ee8-4120-98fa-1ef134c35853","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Proliferation of NSPCs lacking BAF53a, was severely impaired in culture, with mutant cells stalled at G1 & G2/M phases of the cell cycle & a significant increase in anaphase bridges. \nincrease of apoptosis in cultured NSPC","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33602870","rdfs:label":"Mouse Model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9278e3c0-9174-4aed-8c13-b34618e88825_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/994412df-4ef8-480b-9ad5-7d032bdc1a28","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"supportive for the role of BAF53a in the pathway and regulation of neuronal differentiation, does not account for all clinical features.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e734425d-9504-4247-afb4-b937d7e68c96","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Following tamoxifen treatment of NSPCs a cell cycle block at both G1/S and G2/M in cells lacking BAF53a was observed.
