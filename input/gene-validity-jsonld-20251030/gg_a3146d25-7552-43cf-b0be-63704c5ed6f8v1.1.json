SETD2 can also interact with non-histone substrates and methylate microtubules and actin, thereby regulating cytoskeletal functions. Although protein truncating variants in *SETD2* had been observed in a cohort study of individuals with autism spectrum disorder in 2012 (O’Roak et al., PMID: 23160955), the first reports focusing on variants in *SETD2* as a cause of autosomal dominant *SETD2*-related neurodevelopmental disorder without or with macrocephaly/overgrowth were published in 2014 (Luscan et al., PMID: 24852293) and 2015 (Lumish et al., PMID: 26084711). The term selected for curation includes individuals with Luscan-Lumish syndrome (OMIM# 616831) and Intellectual developmental disorder, autosomal dominant 70 (OMIM# 620157). Affected individuals exhibit developmental delay or intellectual disability, motor delay, speech delay, hypotonia, autism spectrum disorder, and sometimes features such as macrocephaly, overgrowth, and dysmorphic features.\n\nThirteen variants (7 frameshift, 4 nonsense, 1 recurrent missense, and 1 splice) that have been reported in 15 probands in 12 publications (PMIDs: 23160955, 24852293, 26084711, 27317772, 29681085, 31643139, 32710489, 33248444, 33766796, 36777730, 37025455, 37372360) are included in this curation. Most of the reported variants are *de novo*. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss of function. However, the mechanism of the recurrent missense variant (NM_014159.7:c.5219G>A, p.Arg1740Gln) reported in three individuals (PMID: 32710489) remains to be determined. Several other *de novo* missense variants were not scored given the absence of evidence of pathogenicity (PMIDs: 23160955, 24852293, 31643139, 33248444, 37372360).\n\nOf note, this gene has also been reported in relation to autosomal dominant *SETD2*-related microcephaly-severe intellectual disability-multiple congenital anomalies syndrome (MONDO:0035706), which was assessed separately.\n\nThis gene-disease relationship is further supported by experimental evidence, including biochemical function and protein interaction studies.
