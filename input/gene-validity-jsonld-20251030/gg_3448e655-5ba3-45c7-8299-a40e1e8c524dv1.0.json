Affected individuals presented with non-syndromic mild ID  and were found to carry a homozygous nonsense variant. Two additional families have been reported. Five affected members of a consanguineous Saudi family  with severe ID, self-mutilating behavior, and seizures carried a homozygous missense variant (PMID: 28143899). In a consanguineous family from Syria, 3 individuals with ID  had a homozygous splice site variant (PMID: 28097321).\nThere is experimental evidence to support this gene-disease relationship, including data showing that the Arg419* variant results in enhanced autoubiquitination and degradation (PMID: 23983124), and mouse models that exhibit learning, memory, and synaptic defects (PMIDs: 21995942, 29459374).\nIn summary, there is moderate evidence supporting a relationship between CRBN and autosomal recessive ID. Given that only three families with pathogenic CRBN variants have been identified since the original report in 2004, additional genetic evidence is necessary to strengthen this gene-disease relationship. This curation was approved by the ClinGen ID/Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel on 2021 May 3 (SOP Version 8).\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3448e655-5ba3-45c7-8299-a40e1e8c524d","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/158c9b6b-2ac8-4ee3-bd89-a57d567e675f","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/158c9b6b-2ac8-4ee3-bd89-a57d567e675f_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2021-05-21T13:50:46.004Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/158c9b6b-2ac8-4ee3-bd89-a57d567e675f_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2021-05-24T12:13:52.599Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"11.1 points","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/158c9b6b-2ac8-4ee3-bd89-a57d567e675f_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/158c9b6b-2ac8-4ee3-bd89-a57d567e675f_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b24b2f28-0602-442a-a20c-0c7b508b5560","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1777790f-7dc0-4e15-aa55-1ef7a4e1f509","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Loss of cereblon in CrbnKO mice results in learning and memory deficits (MWM test and the water-based Y-maze test).

Previous studies have shown that CRBN is the primary target of thalidomide (Ito et al., 2010), a compound known for its teratogenic effects on the developing fetus. ASDs have been associated with fetal exposure to thalidomide at 20–24 d gestation (Strömland et al., 1994) and variations in CRBN copy number (Pinto et al., 2010). While CrbnKO mice show hippocampal-dependent learning and memory deficits, they do not demonstrate changes in social or repetitive behavior, and, as reported previously by Rajadhyaksha et al. (2012), they show unaltered anxiety-like behavior, hallmarks of ASDs. The absence of these behaviors in CrbnKO mice suggests that the CrbnKO mouse is a model to study isolated intellectual disability (Higgins et al., 2000, 2004a, b).","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29459374","rdfs:label":"Mouse KO results in learning, memory, and synaptic defects","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/358bd3a1-b0d0-4f32-9663-c5f4c69e3124","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0222b70d-1f31-47f3-87d6-ee06a7e19d9d","type":"Finding","dc:description":"CrbnKO mice also exhibit synaptic defects (LTP in hippocampus) as a consequence of exaggerated AMPK activity, inhibition of mTORC1 signaling, and decreased glutamatergic synaptic proteins.\nAcute pharmacological inhibition of AMPK activity in adult CrbnKO mice rescues learning and memory deficits and normalizes hippocampal mTORC1 activity and postsynaptic glutamatergic proteins without altering excitatory presynaptic markers.\n","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21995942","rdfs:label":"AMPK activity rescue adult CrbnKO mice ","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:PhenotypeRescue"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanRescueCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0b0ea605-9f72-4fe6-93a1-fdd853badf12","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"this rescues the level of the protein, but not a functional deficit","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/267ba02d-3104-434e-bf00-2e51d9f4e1fd","type":"Finding","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23983124","rdfs:label":"mutant protein can be restored by proteasome inhibitor","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:PhenotypeRescue"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCellCultureRescueCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/158c9b6b-2ac8-4ee3-bd89-a57d567e675f_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f3839004-8431-4e5a-a716-81af4270df71","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"no evidence that the same changes occur in the brain or what would be their precise functional significance.\n","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/24c291d5-16b4-4d2d-94c8-f44b966b1bc2","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Using the real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, we show that mut CRBN disturbs the development of adult brain BK(Ca) isoforms.
