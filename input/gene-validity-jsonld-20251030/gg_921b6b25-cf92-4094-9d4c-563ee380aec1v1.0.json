Eight unique variants predicted to cause a loss of function of the protein have been reported, suggesting homozygous loss of function is a mechanism of autosomal recessive disease. Additionally, six unique variants have been associated with autosomal dominant disease, some of which are suggested to exert a dominant negative effect. This gene-disease relationship is further supported by expression, protein-protein interaction, functional alteration, and animal model studies. In summary, ​BIN1​​ is definitively associated with ​both autosomal recessive centronuclear myopathy characterized by mild, proximal, slowly progressive muscle weakness with onset ranging from birth to childhood and autosomal dominant centronuclear myopathy characterized by progressive adult-onset myopathy without facial weakness. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Congenital Myopathies Gene Curation Expert Panel within the Neuromuscular Working Group on 4/27/20 (SOP Version 7).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/921b6b25-cf92-4094-9d4c-563ee380aec1","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1a2b9d96-97da-473d-8147-a425a5364fcb","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1a2b9d96-97da-473d-8147-a425a5364fcb_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10031","date":"2020-09-16T19:23:21.606Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1a2b9d96-97da-473d-8147-a425a5364fcb_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10031","date":"2020-04-27T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1a2b9d96-97da-473d-8147-a425a5364fcb_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1a2b9d96-97da-473d-8147-a425a5364fcb_seg_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e3b2105b-557b-423f-9934-a6426d4bb41c_proband_segregation","type":"FamilyCosegregation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29950440","rdfs:label":"Family 7","estimatedLodScore":1.45,"family":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e3b2105b-557b-423f-9934-a6426d4bb41c","type":"Family","rdfs:label":"Family 7","ethnicity":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/"},"member":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a54ed9af-186c-4ea9-9cbb-bec40a25fae2","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29950440","rdfs:label":"Patient 7.2","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":23,"detectionMethod":"DNA samples from the affected probands were screened by Sanger sequencing of exons 6 and 8 of BIN1.

The variant is not reported in gnomAD. RT-PCR of RNA isolated from a muscle biopsy of Patient 1 amplified a fragment encompassing exons 10 to 12 and obtained a shorter product compared to the control. Sequencing of the RT-PCR product demonstrated skipping of the in-frame exon 11 in Patient 1 muscle, but inclusion of this exon in control muscle. Further, Western blot analysis of Patient 1 muscle extracts detected a strong reduction of the BIN2 isoforms containing the exon 11 encoded PI-binding domain compared to control muscle extracts. The importance of exon 11 in membrane tubulation in myotubules was demonstrated by over-expression of wild type BIN1 isoform 8 (including exon 11) or over-expression of BIN1 isoform 9 (excluding exon 11) in C2C12 myotubes.
