{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/70b8d6dc-c08e-4804-a900-2a8a23a678b6v1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"The relationship between NARS2 and Leigh syndrome spectrum was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of December 9, 2019. The NARS2 gene encodes mitochondrial asparaginyl-tRNA synthetase 2, one of the mitochondrial aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, which function in mitochondrial translation by catalyzing the attachment of amino acids to their cognate tRNAs. Defects in tRNA charging can result in impaired synthesis of oxidative phosphorylation complex protein subunits.\n\nThe NARS2 gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Leigh syndrome spectrum in 2015 (PMID: 25807530). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included two unique variants identified in one case from one publication (PMID: 25807530). No segregation data were available. Loss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. Of note, this gene has also been implicated in Alpers syndrome and other mitochondrial diseases which will be assessed separately. This gene-disease association is also supported by known biochemical function and rescue studies in patient cells (PMIDs: 29980628, 25807530).\n\nIn summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel December 9, 2019 (SOP Version 7).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/70b8d6dc-c08e-4804-a900-2a8a23a678b6","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8874861d-9d28-440d-a751-54c22df0d4ad","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8874861d-9d28-440d-a751-54c22df0d4ad_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8874861d-9d28-440d-a751-54c22df0d4ad_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2019-12-19T19:07:22.572Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8874861d-9d28-440d-a751-54c22df0d4ad_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8874861d-9d28-440d-a751-54c22df0d4ad_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/91b6db11-2511-41e0-8c19-aee80139844b","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The activity of complexes I, III and IV is directly affected by the level of NARS2","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/90973900-a7b2-4db5-94e6-0e55ffb10d02","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Lentiviral transfection of NARS2 fibroblasts resulted in a significantly increased oxygen consumption rate (OCR) (Fig 5B).
