{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/910c3f52-8be0-4aa3-a4d7-4ace1e443482v1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"The relationship between *MIPEP* and primary mitochondrial disease was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of February 6, 2023. The *MIPEP* gene encodes mitochondrial intermediate peptidase (MIP), a presequence protease which cleaves proteins that are imported into the mitochondrion to their mature size.  \n\nThe *MIPEP* gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive primary mitochondrial disease in 2016 (PMID: 27799064), in four unrelated patients with a severe infantile onset disorder characterized by global developmental delay, seizures, hypotonia, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and left ventricular noncompaction (LVNC).  While various names have been given to the constellation of features seen in those with *MIPEP*-related disease, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *MIPEP* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework.\n\nEvidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included 14 unique variants (10 missense, one nonsense, one frameshift and two large deletions) reported in eight cases from five publications (PMIDs: 27799064, 35598585, 31607746, 27391121, 34620555). Subsequent publications have reported a consistent early-onset disease characterized by global developmental delay with or without a cardiac phenotype. Phenotypic heterogeneity is observed with additional features such as failure to thrive, feeding difficulties, optic atrophy, hypertonia, and microcephaly variably reported. When performed, muscle biopsies showed glycogen accumulation, lipid droplet accumulation within mitochondria, and abnormal mitochondrial morphology, as well as variable decreases in mitochondrial respiratory complex activities I, III and IV.  \n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by a biochemical function shared with other genes associated with primary mitochondrial disease and studies in patient fibroblast cells (PMIDs: 33340416, 34620555).  \n\nIn summary, there is moderate evidence to support the relationship between *MIPEP* and primary mitochondrial disease. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on February 6, 2023 (SOP Version 9).
