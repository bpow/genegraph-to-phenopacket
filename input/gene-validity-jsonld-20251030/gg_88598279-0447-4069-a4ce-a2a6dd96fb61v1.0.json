{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/88598279-0447-4069-a4ce-a2a6dd96fb61v1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"The relationship between IARS2 and Leigh syndrome spectrum was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of November 20, 2019. The IARS2 gene encodes mitochondrial isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase 2, one of the mitochondrial aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, which function in mitochondrial translation by catalyzing the attachment of amino acids to their cognate tRNAs. Defects in tRNA charging can result in impaired synthesis of oxidative phosphorylation complex protein subunits. \n\nThe IARS2 gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Leigh syndrome spectrum in 2014 (PMID: 25130867). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data.\n\nThis curation included four unique variants identified in two cases from two publications (PMIDs: 25130867, 30041933). No segregation data were available. Loss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. Of note, this gene has also been implicated in a syndrome known by the acronym CAGSSS (cataracts, growth hormone deficiency, sensory neuropathy, sensorineural hearing loss, and skeletal dysplasia) which is a distinct clinical entity from the Leigh syndrome spectrum. This gene-disease association is also supported by known biochemical function and expression (PMIDs: 29980628, 25613900). \n\nIn summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel November 20, 2019 (SOP Version 7).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/88598279-0447-4069-a4ce-a2a6dd96fb61","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/50877212-c671-406b-8cb6-195c7369a96c","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/50877212-c671-406b-8cb6-195c7369a96c_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/50877212-c671-406b-8cb6-195c7369a96c_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2019-11-25T15:44:42.667Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/50877212-c671-406b-8cb6-195c7369a96c_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b589d7fb-3aa0-457f-80ab-16bf2b827756_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Evidence of gene impact: lymphoblastoid cell lines from the proband and affected sibling showed reduced IARS2 protein compared with controls (Supplementary Fig. 3).","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1d5febb6-a9ed-4c8e-ad42-1f8bd5972d43","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30041933","rdfs:label":"Patient II-1","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":8,"detectionMethod":"","ethnicity":{"id":"cg:NotHispanicOrLatino"},"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"Benign sacrococcygeal teratoma (Altman type II) at birth.
