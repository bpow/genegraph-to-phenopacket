{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a5c22157-d0fd-4c03-9e94-88bcbac1820fv1.1","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"AHDC1 was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant AHDC1-related intellectual disability-obstructive sleep apnea-mild dysmorphism syndrome (also reported as Xia-Gibbs syndrome) in 2014 (Xia, et al., PMID: 24791903). At least 35 unique variants (e.g. missense, nonsense, frameshift, large deletion, complex rearrangement, etc.) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 40 probands in 9 publications (PMIDs: 29696776, 27148574,  24791903, 30152016, 32256298, 31182893, 29230160, 33372375, 30622101). Twelve variants (nonsense, frameshift) that have been reported in 14 probands in 6 publications (PMIDs: 27148574, 31182893, 32256298, 29230160, 24791903, 30152016) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism for disease is haploinsufficiency (PMIDs: 24791903, 27148574). In summary, AHDC1 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant AHDC1-related intellectual disability-obstructive sleep apnea-mild dysmorphism syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen (Intellectual Disability and Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel) Working Group on the meeting date 11/16/2021 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a5c22157-d0fd-4c03-9e94-88bcbac1820f","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/59a6c010-95ac-4813-9cf4-5ff60fa5c7e9","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/59a6c010-95ac-4813-9cf4-5ff60fa5c7e9_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2021-12-01T13:07:55.035Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/59a6c010-95ac-4813-9cf4-5ff60fa5c7e9_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2021-11-16T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/59a6c010-95ac-4813-9cf4-5ff60fa5c7e9_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1193205c-29a5-4356-86ee-a30e76115ba8","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Please note that we are downgrading the Variant Evidence score of potential loss of function variants from 1.5 points to 0.5 points because this is a single coding-exon gene and there are no functional studies proving that nonsense-mediated decay will occur.
