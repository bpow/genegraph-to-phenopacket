The hearing loss associated with SLC26A4 is typically congenital, pre-, or peri-lingual in onset and caused by enlarged vestibular aqueduct (EVA).  An incomplete partitioning defect of the cochlea may also be present. Goiter and/or hypothyroidism are an incompletely penetrant feature of Pendred syndrome and may not present until the second decade of life (Pryor 2005, Soh 2015). There may be variable expression of the thyroid features, even within families with the same pathogenic variants. Additionally, a large percentage of individuals with hearing loss and EVA lack variants on one or both alleles of SLC26A4. Individuals with a single mutation appear to be less likely to develop the thyroid features, but may have similar recurrence risks as individuals found to harbor two biallelic pathogenic variants (Pryor 2005, Chattaraj 2014). This gene-disease association is supported by animal models, evidence of expression in the ear and thyroid, and in vitro biochemical studies. In summary, SLC26A4 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive Pendred syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hearing Loss Working Group on 6/7/2017.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/28d2508d-a6fb-4386-bfe6-ee4ac6d6f287","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/49e794f4-8725-4499-a0a2-82591b42cab5","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/49e794f4-8725-4499-a0a2-82591b42cab5_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2017-06-07T04:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/49e794f4-8725-4499-a0a2-82591b42cab5_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/49e794f4-8725-4499-a0a2-82591b42cab5_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/49e794f4-8725-4499-a0a2-82591b42cab5_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7960c54c-9b9c-478f-91d1-cc67e2261252","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Downgraded to 1.5 points because, although a good model for SLC26A4-associated hearing loss, no thyroid phenotype","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/97cc9625-6937-47fa-87df-45ca184c163a","type":"Finding","dc:description":"indicating Pds-null mice may better model for nonsyndromic hearing loss/EVA rather than Pendred.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11152663","rdfs:label":"PDS null mice","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/993b65f2-e0c6-4105-ac39-be67666fa3d4","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Downgraded to 1.5 points for the same reason as Everett 2001- the mouse model had no abnormal thyroidal phenotype.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0218ed77-b027-404f-8a46-270f82724213","type":"Finding","dc:description":"This mutation leads to the loss of exon 8 and a prematurely truncated protein.
