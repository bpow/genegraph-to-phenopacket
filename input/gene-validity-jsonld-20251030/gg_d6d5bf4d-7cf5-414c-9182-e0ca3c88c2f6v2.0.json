Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and segregation data. Two splice variant has been reported in two patients in two publicatsions (PMIDs: 29266598, 33977145). This gene-disease association is supported by its biochemical function in muscle contraction (PMID: 7721095), its interaction with *TNNT1* (PMID: 6447509), its expression in skeletal muscle (PMID: 23775847), and a neonatal lethal mouse model (PMID: 23775847). In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship.\n\nOf note, this gene has also been implicated in autosomal dominant distal arthrogryposis which will be assessed separately. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found a difference in molecular mechanism (loss of function for nemaline myopathy versus a functional alteration due to missense variation at Arg63 for autosomal dominant distal arthrogryposis), inheritance pattern (dominant versus recessive), phenotypic variability (presence of nemaline myopathy and absence of facial features associated with autosomal dominant distal arthrogryposis). Therefore, we have split curations for the disease entities of autosomal recessive nemaline myopathy and autosomal dominant distal arthrogryposis. \n\nThis gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the CM GCEP on 02/24/2020. It was reevaluated on 02/21/2025. As a result of this reevaluation new genetic evidence (PMID: 33977145) was identified however the classification remained at Limited. This second case provided additional evidnece for a gene-diseae relationship with a congenital myopathy though the patient did not have nemaline rods.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d6d5bf4d-7cf5-414c-9182-e0ca3c88c2f6","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9617fa6c-fcb4-460a-be4b-2e437267f608","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","changes":[{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"},{"id":"cg:sopChange"},{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},{"id":"cg:newEvidence"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9617fa6c-fcb4-460a-be4b-2e437267f608_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10031","date":"2025-02-24T14:28:50.204Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9617fa6c-fcb4-460a-be4b-2e437267f608_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10031","date":"2025-02-24T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["RecurationTiming","RecurationNewEvidence"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9617fa6c-fcb4-460a-be4b-2e437267f608_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7b2ea9a8-cc87-4c3b-9f71-f25cad370c85_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7b2ea9a8-cc87-4c3b-9f71-f25cad370c85","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29266598","rdfs:label":"Sandaradura Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDeath","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":8,"allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/96bd1dd1-1dd1-4207-8ed3-02b524918350","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"XM_017018206.1(TNNT3):c.714+1G>A (p.=)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA5816571"}},"detectionMethod":"Massively parallel sequencing of the aforementioned 277 gene panel identified an essential donor splice site variant in TNNT3. cDNA/mRNA was derived from a muscle biopsy sample and analysis demonstrated that this induced skipping of Exon 14 and usually retained Intron 14 with no normal splice transcripts causing a null variant.","firstTestingMethod":"Next generation sequencing panels","phenotypeFreeText":"Birthweight was 1.5 kg (50th percentile for gestation), length 31 cm (90th percentile) and head circumference 31 cm (90th percentile), Antigravity movement of upper/lower limbs developed, Muscle fiber degeneration, No regenerating fibers, Hypertrophy of slow fibers with small atrophied fast fibers.","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0040288","obo:HP_0001561","obo:HP_0001838","obo:HP_0005879","obo:HP_0100293","obo:HP_0001845","obo:HP_0000218","obo:HP_0009028","obo:HP_0002943","obo:HP_0001776","obo:HP_0006380","obo:HP_0030319","obo:HP_0001252","obo:HP_0002747","obo:HP_0003798","obo:HP_0010557","obo:HP_0100295","obo:HP_0001283","obo:HP_0008780","obo:HP_0003554","obo:HP_0004887","obo:HP_0002206"],"previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"PathWest NMD panel was used and no pathogenic variants were identified, SNP array did not support a microdeletion, Methylation studies were performed and were not suggestive of uniparental isodisomy, Western blot confirmed protein levels were <5% that of controls with no abberant splice products detected.","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/582c5632-d0fe-424e-a145-52bf75837f09_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29266598","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/96bd1dd1-1dd1-4207-8ed3-02b524918350"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:AlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"}}},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/582c5632-d0fe-424e-a145-52bf75837f09","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The homozygous splice variant NM_006757.3:c.681+1G>A occurs at the intron 14 donor splice site, disrupting splicing by skipping of exon 14 or retention of intron 14.
