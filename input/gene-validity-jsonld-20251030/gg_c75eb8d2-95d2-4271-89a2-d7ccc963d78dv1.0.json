At least 11 unique variants (missense, frameshift, nonsense, indel) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 11 probands in 3 publications (PMIDs: 27259053, 28375175, 29243290). This gene-disease association is supported by protein interaction studies and biochemical functional assays. In summary GANAB is definitively associated with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease with or without polycystic liver disease. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Cystic and Ciliopathy Disorders GCEP on 9/9/2020.

Mature PC1 levels correlate with disease severity. CRISPR/Cas9 was used to target exon 12 of GANAB in human RCTE cells to generate clones with biallelic frameshift mutations or a single in-frame deletion. \n(1) Analysis of the polycystin complex immunocaptured with PC2 or PC1-CT antibodies in wild type cells showed  mature PC1 product, while the same was absent in the GANAB -/- cells. \n(2) To evaluate the effect of GANAB on ciliary localization of PC2: confocal z stack rendering of primary cilia in confluent WT and GANAB-/- cells showed no cilia PC2 signal in GANAB-/- cells.\n(3) WT and GANAB-/- cells with tagged PC1 and PC2 constructs (mCherry-PC1-V5 and GFP-PC2) were co-transfected. Co-transfected cells were screened for live cell-surface PC1 signal and quantified as the percentage of surface-positive PC1 cells out of the total co-transfected cells. Surface PC1 was detected on 55.0% +/- 6.8% of WT cells but only 5.9% +/- 2.0% of GANAB-/- cells (p % 0.0001), and the level was rescued to 32.7% +/- 4.9% by co-transfection with the WT GANAB (FLAG-GIIa) plasmid.\n(4) Immunoblot of PC1-NT in WT and GANAB-/- cells showed a reduced level of PC1-NTR (mature product) in GANAB-/- cells. Quantification of PC1-NTR shows a reduction to ~50% (p < 0.001, Student’s t test) in heterozygous GANAB +/- cells and a complete loss in homozygous GANAB-/- cells.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27259053","rdfs:label":"Effect on maturation and localization of PC1 and PC2","demonstrates":{"id":"obo:MI_0915"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1.5}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":1523,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria7","strengthScore":13,"subject":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/oM0-dCuLbXM","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0010916","gene":"hgnc:4138","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"1.0","websiteLegacyID":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/assertion_e6392961-a64a-4818-903a-0bf88b32e736-","@context":{"@vocab":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"},"curationReasons":{"@type":"@vocab","@container":"@set"},"GCISnapshot":{"@type":"@id"},"dc:isVersionOf":{"@type":"@id"},"websiteLegacyID":{"@type":"@id"}}}
