{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d741d44e-a58a-43e8-8c98-92cc1e99cc25v1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"The relationship between *SLC25A12* (also referred to as *AGC1* and *Aralar*) and primary mitochondrial disease was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of August 21, 2023. *SLC25A12* encodes the muscle and brain specific isoform of mitochondrial aspartate-glutamate carrier (Ca2+ binding), which is the regulatory component of the NADH malate-aspartate shuttle (MAS) that transfers cytosolic redox power to mitochondria. \n\n*SLC25A12* was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive primary mitochondrial disease in 2009 (PMID: 19641205), in a patient with epilepsy, spasticity, and developmental delay. While various names have been given to the constellation of features seen in those with *SLC25A12*-related disease, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *SLC25A12* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework.\n\nEvidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included five unique variants (three missense, one nonsense, one intronic 2bp deletion predicted to impact splicing) in four probands from three publications (PMIDs: 24515575, 31403263, 32700846). Features seen in affected individuals include epilepsy, spasticity, developmental delay, developmental regression, and optic neuropathy. Brain MRI findings include bilateral basal ganglia lesions, thin corpus callosum, hypomyelination, and cerebellar atrophy. Notably, muscle respiratory chain enzyme assays may not show deficiency in affected individuals, but ATP production, particularly in the presence of glutamate and malate, and decreased NAA on brain magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) are common in affected individuals.  \n\nThis gene-disease association is also supported by experimental evidence given the association of *SLC25A12* with *GOT2* and *MDH2*, which both act in the mitochondrial malate aspartate shuttle and are associated with similar phenotypes (PMID: 35008954), expression in relevant brain and muscle tissue (PMID: 9722566), and *SLC25A12* knockout studies performed in mice (PMID: 15987682). Of note, a canine model of inflammatory myopathy was reviewed (PMID: 31594244) and excluded from scoring given there are no case reports of an inflammatory myopathy in humans to date. \n\nIn summary, there is moderate evidence to support the relationship between *SLC25A12* and primary mitochondrial disease. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on August 21, 2023 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d741d44e-a58a-43e8-8c98-92cc1e99cc25","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/47bba424-b4e3-4216-aae0-2a4602bc2e92","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/47bba424-b4e3-4216-aae0-2a4602bc2e92_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2023-08-21T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/47bba424-b4e3-4216-aae0-2a4602bc2e92_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2024-01-16T16:26:26.717Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/47bba424-b4e3-4216-aae0-2a4602bc2e92_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/47bba424-b4e3-4216-aae0-2a4602bc2e92_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/acf51525-c8ce-4cbd-b8bd-a059edad9c8b","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"0.5 (early death) + 0.5 (seizures and motor + tremor phenotype) + 0.5 (reduced MAS activity) + 0.5 (dramtically decrease respiration when using glutamate + malate) + 0.5 (N-acetylaspartate, and that of aspartate are drastically decreased in the brain of Aralar-/- mice. and delayed myelination)","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cfa99a22-7d47-4afc-a0ba-fceef11b2c25","type":"Finding","dc:description":"The biochemical findings of decreased respiration with glutamate and malate, reduction in MAS activity, the reduced NAA in brain in addition to the neurologic phenotype and early demise of the mice mimics cases reported to date","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15987682","rdfs:label":"Mouse Homozygous Knockout of Aralar (SLC25A12)","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c3b9225d-19a8-456c-b6fb-3483fae82716","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"GCEP elected to exclude for current curation given deviation from phenotype reported in patients to date","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7f16f605-5bc2-4480-874e-248527cd16f8","type":"Finding","dc:description":"he transport activity of the p.L349P AGC1 mutant was measured upon reconstitution of purified recombinant protein into liposomes.
