Immunodeficiency 61 is a primary immunodeficiency characterized by the onset of recurrent bacterial infections in early childhood due to impaired antibody production. Affected individuals have normal numbers of circulating B and T cells, but B cells have an intrinsic defect in antibody production. At least 1 unique variant (an intragenic deletion encompassing exon 2 to exon 6) has been reported in humans (PMID: 29636373). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level and experimental data. Summary of Case Level Data (1.5 points): Variants in this gene have been reported in 2 siblings in 1 publication (PMID: 29636373). Phenotypes described in the siblings include hypogammaglobulinemia (decreased IgG2, IgG4 and IgM in sibling 1 and almost complete absence of all Ig isotypes in sibling 2) and recurrent bacterial infections (in early childhood in sibling 1 and until death at age 15 years in sibling 2). Summary of experimental data (4 points): SH3KBP1-knockout mice were found to recapitulate the cellular and molecular phenotype seen in the human patient with impaired response to immunization (PMID: 21708930). Additionally, interaction with BLNK (PMID: 11071869) indicate a potential role of CIN85 in the B cell receptor-mediated signaling pathway, which was altered in SH3KBP1 deficient cells both from patients and non-patient sources (PMID: 29636373). In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a033355e-e68a-4dd8-8fca-f3e736c082ad","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3cc42cdd-5484-467b-9e35-7529716114dd","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3cc42cdd-5484-467b-9e35-7529716114dd_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10080","date":"2021-11-16T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3cc42cdd-5484-467b-9e35-7529716114dd_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10080","date":"2021-12-09T18:50:55.937Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3cc42cdd-5484-467b-9e35-7529716114dd_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3cc42cdd-5484-467b-9e35-7529716114dd_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1bd0399c-5fcc-4520-8a81-ce7de68ea31c","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1d100138-c2a7-423a-86f0-2bbc1a665dc2","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Loss of SH3KBP1 expression in human B cells compromised distinct effector mechanisms of BCR signal transduction that are known to be critical for proper B cell activation.
