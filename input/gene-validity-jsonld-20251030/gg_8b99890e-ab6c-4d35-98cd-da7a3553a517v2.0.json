Over 20 unique de novo truncating variants have been reported in over 30 probands (PMIDs 23033978, 22495311, 28135719, 31723249). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship is derived from case-level data. Individuals with ZNF292 truncating variants present with neurodevelopmental phenotypes (including intellectual disability/developmental delay, speech delays and autism spectrum disorder) and minor dysmorphic features. Although most reported variants are de novo, one ZNF292 truncating variant was inherited from an affected mother with mild ID (PMID 31723249). In addition, three affected siblings inherited a ZNF292 truncating variant from a reportedly unaffected father, suggesting reduced penetrance (PMID 31723249). ZNF292 is highly intolerant to truncating variants (pLI = 1 in gnomAD). Currently, there are no experimental data delineating the disease mechanism. Most reported variants are located in the last exon, which encodes for a DNA binding domain; these variants are predicted to escape nonsense-mediated decay, leading to the expression of a truncated protein with potential dominant-negative or gain-of function effects (PMID 31723249). However, the possibility of loss of function cannot be ruled out, and functional studies will be necessary to determine the molecular mechanism of pathogenicity. Reports of a large number of independent probands ascertained from various geographic locations with de novo truncating ZNF292 variants and consistent neurodevelopmental phenotypes provided convincing evidence of the gene-disease relationship. In summary, there is sufficient evidence to support a definitive gene-disease relationship between ZNF292 and complex neurodevelopmental disorders. The classification was approved by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel on 05/06/20 (SOP Version 7).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8b99890e-ab6c-4d35-98cd-da7a3553a517","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/dba438b7-23f9-4c15-a8aa-f70431a193e2","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":[{"id":"cg:classificationChange"},{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"},{"id":"cg:sopChange"},{"id":"cg:summaryChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/dba438b7-23f9-4c15-a8aa-f70431a193e2_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2020-09-16T19:23:02.773Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/dba438b7-23f9-4c15-a8aa-f70431a193e2_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2020-05-06T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/dba438b7-23f9-4c15-a8aa-f70431a193e2_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/dba438b7-23f9-4c15-a8aa-f70431a193e2_cc_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d0d7e74c-5c5d-48d1-b735-cdce50efe255","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"None of the ZNF292 missense mutation had a CADD score above 30, which was a criteria established by the authors to be considered disease causing.","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d0d7e74c-5c5d-48d1-b735-cdce50efe255_cc_evidence_item","type":"Finding","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27824329","rdfs:label":"Chinese ASD study","caseCohort":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/31544f28-12b6-4114-a518-a262f018ff68","type":"Cohort","allGenotypedSequenced":1543,"alleleFrequency":0.0006480881399870382,"detectionMethod":"Single molecule molecular inversion probes (smMIPs) were used to sequence 213 autism risk genes.

He is very sensory oriented and extremely hyperactive with a substantial loss of executive function. He has significant sleep problems waking in the middle of the night with out returning to sleep on as many as 5 nights per week. He has GERD which may play a role in sleep issues, but we have not been able to correlate night waking with an particular food. Feeding is not a problem and after early struggles with frequent loose stools he is now fairly regular. He was early on diagnosed with strabismus, but that has resolved. His condition appears to be neurodegenerative as he has lost the ability to speak and we're seeing some decline in fine motor control and a significant decline in executive function.\"","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001270","obo:HP_0000486","obo:HP_0000717","obo:HP_0001344","obo:HP_0001263","obo:HP_0001249","obo:HP_0000752","obo:HP_0002020","obo:HP_0001631","obo:HP_0002194","obo:HP_0000729"],"previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"unknown","secondTestingMethod":"Whole genome shotgun sequencing","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/66bfc099-5dfd-4273-9c00-5cc3cd2c559d_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27191528","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b9bfc2dc-2fe7-41da-b244-582f76a5ad86"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:DeNovoAlleleOrigin"}}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADDeNovoCriteria","strengthScore":0},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/df3fbb6d-02a2-403f-a03c-2b123c6bdfe6_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Downgrade because targeted sequencing was used.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e57a169b-e1be-436e-9d13-72757aaa24ff","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31723249","rdfs:label":"17-012 (P21)","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":6,"detectionMethod":"Panel of 456 NDD genes","firstTestingMethod":"Next generation sequencing panels","phenotypeFreeText":"short stature treated by growth hormone. dilated cardiomyopathy, feeding issues, and a pectus adductus deformity.
