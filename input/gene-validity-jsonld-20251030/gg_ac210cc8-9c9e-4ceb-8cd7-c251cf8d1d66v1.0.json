{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ac210cc8-9c9e-4ceb-8cd7-c251cf8d1d66v1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"EPS8 was reported in relation to ARNSHL in 2014 (Behlouli et al., PMID: 24741995). At least 4 unique variants (nonsense, frameshift, missense, splicing) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 4 probands in 3 publications (PMID: 24741995, 27344577, 30303587) and segregated with disease in 2 additional family members. This gene-disease association is supported by animal models, expression studies, protein interactions, and functional alterations in non-patient cells. In summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged. An additional case was counted under case-level data for the genetic evidence for this gene-disease association. A proband with an affected sibling from a consanguineous family was found to harbor the NM_004447:c.1151C>T (p.Pro384Leu) variant. This would increase the genetic evidence score from 9.5 to 10 points and the overall classification would remain \"Moderate.\" This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hearing Loss Working Group on 2/6/2020.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ac210cc8-9c9e-4ceb-8cd7-c251cf8d1d66","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7a6bd2bf-8ede-45cb-a1c1-65ee5221b440","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7a6bd2bf-8ede-45cb-a1c1-65ee5221b440_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2020-02-06T17:16:14.553Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7a6bd2bf-8ede-45cb-a1c1-65ee5221b440_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7a6bd2bf-8ede-45cb-a1c1-65ee5221b440_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7a6bd2bf-8ede-45cb-a1c1-65ee5221b440_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a4693c51-f6d1-403b-bd5a-0c1217034c2c","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3ad6271a-24c4-495b-a540-6a9b9f2fe3eb","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Both humans and mice exhibit deafness","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21236676","rdfs:label":"Mouse KO Model","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0592092d-250a-40f2-bbbb-e0bc519fbef2","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Same mouse as Manor 2011. 0.5 points given for describing hearing phenotype of KO mice in detail","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/28ed5e08-826c-4c3d-8925-9a0d123a87c8","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Both experience hearing loss.
