The phenotype is specific to GCK and generally comprises lifelong stable, mild fasting hyperglycemia in the impaired fasting glucose to low diabetic range that generally neither responds to nor requires treatment, exhibits normal response to a glucose load, and has been associated with a much lower prevalence of the vascular complications typically seen with diabetes (PMID 24430320).  This disease entity is often referred to as maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) 2 (MODY2) and GCK-MODY, as well as GCK-associated hyperglycemia.  \n\n \n\nFor the association of GCK with MODY2 autosomal dominant monogenic diabetes, numerous variants have been reported in humans per ClinVar and variants in this gene have been reported in at least 11 probands in 7 publications (PMIDs: 25555642, 1570017, 21104275, 23085272, 27269892, 27289208, 25850297). Segregation and familial inheritance has also been noted (PMIDs: 1545870, 23085272, 21104275, 1570017). Additional evidence is available in the literature, however the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism for disease is heterozygous loss of function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by expression studies, animal models, and in vitro functional assays. In summary, GCK is definitively associated with autosomal dominant monogenic diabetes (MODY2) or impaired fasting glucose with the specific phenotype noted above. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time.  \n\n\nPer criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting working group, we found differences in molecular mechanisms, inheritance patterns, and phenotypic variability underlying the GCK-related disease entities. Therefore, we have split curations for these disease entities.  \n\n\nThe present curation includes (1) Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) 2, MODY2 (MIM:125851) (due to heterozygous inactivating GCK variants). Other disease entities requiring separate curations include (2) Diabetes mellitus, permanent neonatal (MIM:606176) (due to homozygous or compound heterozygous GCK variants, usually requiring insulin treatment), and (3) Hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia, familial, 3 (MIM:602485) (due to heterozygous activating GCK variants). Type 2 diabetes (polygenic; MIM:125853) will not be curated since the contribution of GCK is in the form of common variants with a small effect.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/096da63a-72ef-4afd-a384-f5bc877122e8","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c7291ae0-3356-4c7b-832a-edae5176739f","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c7291ae0-3356-4c7b-832a-edae5176739f_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10016","date":"2020-05-13T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c7291ae0-3356-4c7b-832a-edae5176739f_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10016","date":"2020-09-16T19:23:13.083Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c7291ae0-3356-4c7b-832a-edae5176739f_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c7291ae0-3356-4c7b-832a-edae5176739f_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/349795c5-6a1f-4fb0-98a3-0dd507e30d76","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Scored
