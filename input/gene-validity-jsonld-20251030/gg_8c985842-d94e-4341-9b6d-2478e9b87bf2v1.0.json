A mutation in AVIL was first reported in association with autosomal recessive nephrotic syndrome type 21 in 2017 (Rao et al., PMID: 29058690). Nephrotic syndrome type 21 (congenital nephrotic syndrome) is characterized by significant proteinuria during the first months or years of life, leading to generalized edema. AVIL-related nephrotic syndrome type 21 (OMIM: 618594) is currently the only disease association reported for this gene.\n\nThis curation includes four variants (frameshift and missense) identified in three probands, all described in a single publication (Rao et al., PMID: 29058690). No additional evidence is available in the literature. (Genetic evidence: 3.1 points) The proposed mechanism of pathogenicity is loss of function. \n\nThis gene-disease association is supported by expression studies and in vitro functional assays (PMID: 29058690).\nAVIL expression was demonstrated in extracts from cultured human podocytes (PMID: 29058690). Co-localization of AVIL and PLCE1 was observed in human podocytes transfected with GFP (green fluorescent protein)-tagged, full-length (FL) mouse Avil. The interaction between AVIL and PLCE1 was further confirmed in HEK293 cells. Functional studies showed that human podocytes transfected with three patient variants (Arg135Gln, Leu425Met, or Phe656Valfs*7) *exhibited reduced migration rates and impaired actin-binding and -bundling abilities.\nAdditionally, EGF stimulation increased diacylglycerol (DAG) levels in control cells treated with scrambled siRNA. Knockdown of AVIL via siRNA decreased active DAG levels. This effect was rescued by overexpression of wild-type Avil, but not by any of the three patient-derived mutant clones (Arg135Gln, Leu425Met, and Phe656Valfs*7)*. A CRISPR-based AVIL knockdown model was also generated in zebrafish; however, the model did not exhibit a larval edema phenotype (Experimental Evidence: 2 points).\n\nTotal Score: Genetic Evidence (3.1) + Experimental Evidence (2.0) = 5.1 points\n\nThe AVIL-associated nephrotic syndrome type 21 is currently classified as ‘Limited’. This classification reflects the fact that the association has not yet been repeatedly demonstrated in both research and clinical diagnostic settings over time. This gene-disease relationship was initially evaluated by the ClinGen Glomerulopathy GCEP on June 27, 2023 (SOP Version 9), and re-evaluated on August 27, 2024 (SOP Version 10). The classification remained unchanged following the reevaluation.\n\n\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8c985842-d94e-4341-9b6d-2478e9b87bf2","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/04806c21-071c-4a74-96c2-ab89ef5ba0e0","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/04806c21-071c-4a74-96c2-ab89ef5ba0e0_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10068","date":"2024-08-27T18:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/04806c21-071c-4a74-96c2-ab89ef5ba0e0_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10068","date":"2025-09-24T21:51:29.266Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/04806c21-071c-4a74-96c2-ab89ef5ba0e0_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0f691f0d-d23c-4279-b0e8-6db2358af706_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/805831cc-7abc-4e6c-b1ab-50e8d8222cec","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Downgraded due to the homozygous consanguinty","calculatedScore":1.0,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/805831cc-7abc-4e6c-b1ab-50e8d8222cec_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"For the actin-bundling assay, WT or mutant (Arg135Gln, Leu425Met, or Phe-\n656Valfs*7) Avil GST proteins (1 μM) were incubated with F-actin.

It showed co-localization. \n\nAlso, AVIL interacted with PLCE1 upon co-overexpression in HEK293T cells. GFP-tagged AVIL was co-overexpressed with Flag-tagged PLCE1 in HEK293T cells. Co-IP using Flag showed that GFP-tagged AVIL interacted with Flag-tagged PLCE1\n\nAdditionally, Podocytes with shRNA-mediated AVIL knockdown did not show a significant change in podocyte morphology, but there was a decrease in the formation of actin stress fibers, failure of PLCE1 recruitment to the ARP3-rich region, decreased levels of downstream diacyglycerol (DAG) signaling, and impaired podocyte migration rate.\n","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29058690","rdfs:label":"Rao, 2017 PMID (29058690)","demonstrates":{"id":"obo:MI_0935"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/618171db-a0da-4ea1-97a3-dd4034b54c4e","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"It was upgraded due to additional information.
