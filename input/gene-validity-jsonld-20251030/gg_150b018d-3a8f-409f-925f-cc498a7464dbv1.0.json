The MT-ND5 gene encodes the NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) core subunit ND5. Defects of this protein lead to complex I deficiency.\n\nThe MT-ND5 gene was first reported in relation to maternally inherited Leigh syndrome spectrum in 2002 (PMID: 11938446). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included 6 variants in 21 cases (1 with m.12706T>C, 1 with m.13042G>A, 1 with m.13063G>A, 9 with m.13094T>C, 1 with m.13511A>T, and 8 with m.13513G>A) from 8 publications (PMIDs: 17400793, 11938446, 12624137, 18495510, 23918514, 17535832, 29506874, 23034978). Of note, while Gene Curation SOP Version 8 maxes case level missense variant total score at 7, the Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel agreed the maximum score would be 12 given that the majority of pathogenic mitochondrial DNA variants are missense variants. Segregation information is scored as case level evidence according to the criteria established by the Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel. Loss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease association is also supported by known protein interaction, functional alterations in patient cells, and functional alteration in non-patient cells (PMIDs: 27509854, 32366037, 26159306). \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support this gene-disease relationship, including that more than three years have elapsed from the first proposal of the association. This classification was approved by the NICHD U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on May 24, 2021 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/150b018d-3a8f-409f-925f-cc498a7464db","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e941d385-716f-4264-8f24-ffe3022579e2","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e941d385-716f-4264-8f24-ffe3022579e2_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2021-06-14T15:55:47.781Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e941d385-716f-4264-8f24-ffe3022579e2_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2021-06-14T15:55:37.548Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"21 cases scored from 8 publications scored a total of 19.75 points.

Analysis of enzymatic activities of respiratory complexes highlighted a normal function of complexes II, III and IV (CS normalized) but a decreased activity of CS in LS fibroblasts (Figure 1C), supporting a decrease in mitochondrial mass as the main contribution to the lower levels of respiration. Extracellular lactate measurements demonstrated that LS fibroblasts produced more than twice the lactate generated by control fibroblasts.\n\n2. iPSC line, LND554SV.4,m.13513G>A at  45% heteroplasmy, derived from the patient fibroblasts. A control line was also generated from normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDFs); iPSC line (N44SV.1). The LND554SV.4 line showed  a defect in the activity of complexes I and III of LS iPSC (Figure 2C). Similar to fibroblasts, lactate levels were increased in LS iPSCs as compared to control iPSCs (Figure 2D).\n\n3) Neural stem cells (NSCs) were derived from both patient and control iPSCs and stained positive for the NSC marker nestin (Figure 3A). The m.13513G>A mutation was retained in patient NSCs at a percentage of 19.26%. The NSCs were differentiated into neurons over 6 weeks (iPSC-iNs). LS neural stem cells (NSCs) manifested similar proliferative and differentiation capacity (Fig3.)\nFig 4. iNs co-cultured with mouse astrocytes showing a marked neurodegeneration in the patient in comparison with the control both at days 21 and 42. Seahorse XFe96 Analyzer was used to quantify oxygen consumption whilst the neurons were in culture, showing a reduced basal and maximal respiration in patient cells as well as reduced complex I contribution. \nPatch clamp studies were used to demonstrate no abnormalities in intrinsic properties or AP characteristics of patient neurons as compared to control. \nIntracellular calcium concentrations were analyzed by live cell calcium imaging in NSC-derived neurons, after 6 weeks of differentiation and used to demonstrate a Ca2+ buffering defect. \n","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32366037","rdfs:label":"iPSC MT-ND5 m.13513G>A"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a28f3cac-15bd-4e6f-817a-d8109a97e65a","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Cybrid study demonstrating OXPHOS deficiency which is rescued upon mitoTALEN treatment and restoration of wildtype mitochondrial DNA levels.
