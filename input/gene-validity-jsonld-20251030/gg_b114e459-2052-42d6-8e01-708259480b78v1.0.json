{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b114e459-2052-42d6-8e01-708259480b78v1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"FLT4 (formerly VEGFR3) encodes a tyrosine kinase receptor that plays a role in angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis and was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant Lymphatic malformation 1 (Milroy disease) in 2000 (Karkkainen MJ et al., Irrthum A et al.) and autosomal dominant congenital heart defects in 2017 (Jin et al., PMID: 28991257). Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found differences in molecular mechanism(s) and phenotypic variability between reported phenotypic assertions. Therefore, the following disease entities have been split into multiple disease entities; Lymphatic malformation (OMIM:153100) and Congenital heart defects, multiple types, 7 (OMIM:618780). The split curation for autosomal dominant Congenital heart defects, multiple types, 7 has been performed separately. \n\nLymphatic malformation 1 is primarily characterized by bilateral lower-limb lymphedema with inter and intra-familial variability, hydrocele in males, prominent (varicose) veins below the knees, and dysplastic toenails. Prenatal manifestations may include pedal edema, mild pleural effusions, and rarely non-immune fetal hydrops. Sixteen probands including 5 prenatal presentations are included in this curation along with affected family members (n = ~75) (PMIDs: 10835628, 10856194, 12960217, 16231305, 17250670, 18719607, 16965327, 23074044, 33027564, 34103024). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. To date, only nonsynonymous and in-frame deletion variants located in the exons encoding for the tyrosine kinase domain (aa 845-1173) have been reported, and affected individuals were not reported to have congenital heart defects. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence; expression studies demonstrating lymphatic endothelial expression (PMIDs: 7724599, 8245783), in vitro functional assays demonstrating abolished tyrosine kinase autophosphorylation and downstream target phosphorylation (PMIDs: 10835628, 10856194), and animal models demonstrating the phenotypes reported in humans (PMIDs: 11175851, 11592985). In summary, FLT4 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant Lymphatic malformation 1. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both clinical diagnostic and research settings, and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b114e459-2052-42d6-8e01-708259480b78","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/623ef8f5-43ba-43e2-9c2d-fd44e87d6946","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/623ef8f5-43ba-43e2-9c2d-fd44e87d6946_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10106","date":"2023-05-16T20:58:17.305Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/623ef8f5-43ba-43e2-9c2d-fd44e87d6946_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10106","date":"2022-12-19T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/623ef8f5-43ba-43e2-9c2d-fd44e87d6946_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/aacc6c9a-f144-4190-906c-04ceb77a2fbe","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Six affected individuals in the family and the variant co-segregates with the phenotype.
