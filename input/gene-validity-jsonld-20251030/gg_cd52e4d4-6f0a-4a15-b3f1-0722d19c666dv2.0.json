This disorder is characterized by brain malformations, with neurodevelopmental findings, dysmorphic features, and cardiovascular malformations. *WASHC5* has also been associated with autosomal dominant hereditary spastic paraplegia 8 by Valdmanis et al. in 2007 (PMID: 17160902). Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found a difference in inheritance pattern and in clinical phenotype between the two disease assertions. Therefore, the diseases were split into Ritscher-Schinzel syndrome 1 (OMIM: 220210) and hereditary spastic paraplegia 8 (OMIM: 603563). The split curation for autosomal recessive hereditary spastic paraplegia 8 has been curated separately.\nEvidence supporting the relationship between *WASHC5* and Ritscher-Schinzel syndrome 1 includes case-level data. Elliott et al. (2013, PMID: 24065355) identified a homozygous canonical splice site variant in 10 affected individuals from an isolated First Nations community. A homozygous missense variant was identified in another individual but was not scored (Maddirevula et al., 2020, PMID: 33456446). This gene-disease relationship is not supported by experimental evidence. There are two animal models (one mouse and one zebrafish) reported in the literature but neither provide evidence to support the gene-disease relationship (Bu et al., PMID:32417190) In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the ClinGen Syndromic Disorders GCEP on September 17, 2021. It was reevaluated on December 4, 2024 (SOP Version 11). Although a new case report was published (PMID: 36130690), the classification did not change.\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cd52e4d4-6f0a-4a15-b3f1-0722d19c666d","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9920b2c1-29bd-42db-be54-b9757f7c4f6b","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","changes":[{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"},{"id":"cg:newEvidence"},{"id":"cg:sopChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9920b2c1-29bd-42db-be54-b9757f7c4f6b_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10060","date":"2025-04-04T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9920b2c1-29bd-42db-be54-b9757f7c4f6b_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10060","date":"2025-06-30T17:12:39.668Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["RecurationTiming"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9920b2c1-29bd-42db-be54-b9757f7c4f6b_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/31fa72da-4480-4678-a849-d57361813cb6_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/31fa72da-4480-4678-a849-d57361813cb6","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24065355","rdfs:label":"1","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3407d3b2-950d-41b4-850b-971797ff38c1","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_014846.4(WASHC5):c.3335+2T>A","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA145522"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Homozygosity mapping","phenotypeFreeText":"Macrocephaly, prominent forehead, low posterior hairline, wide and downslanting palpebral fissures, hypertelorism, coloboma (right iris), low set ears, brachycephaly, CNS findings (increased cisterna magna, unusual frontal horns), ID.","previousTesting":false,"secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/62f3c20f-cb84-4595-99b5-449be6c47f2b_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24065355","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3407d3b2-950d-41b4-850b-971797ff38c1"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"}}},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/62f3c20f-cb84-4595-99b5-449be6c47f2b","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Variant evidence total score is 2.5: 1.5 each for variant 1 and variant 2, then reduced by 0.5 points total for homozygosity.","calculatedScore":4,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/62f3c20f-cb84-4595-99b5-449be6c47f2b_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/62f3c20f-cb84-4595-99b5-449be6c47f2b_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"RT-PCR using RNA from 2 of the affected individuals (no indication which patients were used) and 1 control individual showed a mean 7.85-fold reduction in the relative amount of KIAA0196 transcript in patient samples vs control.
