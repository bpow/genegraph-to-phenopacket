{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/500688ac-b24b-4f5d-afbd-49f4dcbe320ev1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"*POU2AF1*, encoding the Bob1 protein, was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive agammaglobulinemia in 2021 by Kury et al (PMID: 33571536). This is the only report of a patient with a Bob1 deficiency caused by a homozygous *POU2AF1* null mutation (NM_006235.3:c.233del) resulting in a severe B-cell–intrinsic defect. B-cell receptor signaling was reduced and plasmablast development and immunoglobulin secretion seemed abrogated in the patient. This gene-disease relationship is supported by experimental evidence; the highly B lymphocyte-specific pattern of *POU2AF1* expression in lymphocytes, together with its selective stimulatory effect on immunoglobulin promoters strongly indicates that *POU2AF1*is a critical determinant of immunoglobulin transcription in lymphoid cells (PMID: 7859290), which is deficient in patient cells but can be rescued by lentiviral reconstitution (PMID: 33571536). The immunologic manifestations in the patient showed some overlap with the Bob1 knockout mice (PMIDs: 8977324, 8849727, 8849728, 35603192). Patient T cells were normal in terms of distribution and activation except for a reduction in circulating T-follicular helper (TFH) cells (PMID: 33571536). While it has been shown that *POU2AF1* does not act as a transcriptional coactivator for T cells (PMID: 35285071) the observed defect in T follicular helper differentiation is likely related to its functional impact in B cells, however, in a mouse model, it was shown that *POU2AF1* is expressed in activated (not naïve) T cells, and when deleted in T cells had a positive regulatory impact on autoimmune diabetes, suggesting that it has a role to play in T-cell-driven autoimmunity, and facilitates polarization of activated T helper cells to a TH17 phenotype (PMID: 33295943). In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Antibody Deficiencies GCEP on 09/20/2022 (SOP Version 9).\n\nOf note, in B cells, CD19 and *POU2AF1* may also serve as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (PMID: 35479834). Additionally, expression of *POU2AF1* in non-lymphocytes, specifically in airway epithelium appears to contribute to regulation of host immunity (PMID: 26927796).
