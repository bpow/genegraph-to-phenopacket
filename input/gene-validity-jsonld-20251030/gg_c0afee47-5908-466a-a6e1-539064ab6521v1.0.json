Immunodeficiency-59 and hypoglycemia (IMD59) is an autosomal recessive primary immunologic disorder characterized by combined immunodeficiency and recurrent septic infections of the respiratory tract, skin, and mucous membranes, as well as disturbed glucose metabolism. Granulocyte, B-cell, and dendritic cell deficiency are present.\n\nSix missense variants reported in four probands in four publications (PMIDs: 27913302, 35549617, 35822684, 32888943) are included in this curation. The probands presented with frequent septic infections of the respiratory tract and skin, granulocytopenia, psychomotor deterioration, neutropenia, low B-cell count, normal CD4+ T cells, and normal CD8+ T cells among other phenotypes. The mechanism of pathogenicity is not clear. Other pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants reported in ClinVar are large copy number changes that include more genes than *HYOU1*. \n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also known as immunodeficiency 59 and hypoglycemia (MONDO:0009305) which has been supported by experimental evidence (expression studies) (PMIDs:18094145, 35822684). *ORP150* plays an important role in protein folding and secretion in the ER, perhaps as a molecular chaperone in concert with other stress-induced genes referred to as glucose-regulated proteins (GRPs). GRPs are members of the stress-responsive superfamily of genes that also includes heat shock proteins (HSPs). GRPs and HSPs are essential for normal cellular function, and *ORP150* regulation may play a crucial role in coping with environmental stress. *HYOU1* is one of many genes that are associated with congenital neutropenia, disorders characterized by low neutrophil counts, susceptibility to infections, and viable developmental abnormalities. The hypogammaglobulinemia associated with *HYOU1* deficiency is however less common among congenital neutropenia disorders. Like many of the other congenital neutropenia genes, pathogenic variants in *HYOU1* are associated with a risk for leukemic transformation.\n\nAnimal models (PMIDs: 10037731, 15223375, 11714735) of *ORP150* deficiency do not have signs of granulocytopenia or hypogammaglobulinemia but instead, exhibit neurodegenerative features. Neurodegeneration has not been described in patients with *HYOU1*-related granulocytopenia with immunoglobulin abnormality but most have died early in life so it remains unclear whether this could develop with age.\n\nIn summary, there is limited evidence supporting the relationship between *HYOU1* and autosomal recessive granulocytopenia with immunoglobulin abnormality. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Primary Immune Regulatory Disorders GCEP on the meeting date January, 21, 2025 (SOP Version 11).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c0afee47-5908-466a-a6e1-539064ab6521","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a1d9da94-991f-4fea-aabe-484578dfb2eb","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a1d9da94-991f-4fea-aabe-484578dfb2eb_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10145","date":"2025-01-21T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a1d9da94-991f-4fea-aabe-484578dfb2eb_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10145","date":"2025-01-29T14:16:45.420Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a1d9da94-991f-4fea-aabe-484578dfb2eb_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/44a6b5cf-aa24-4739-b910-4f660f7c7368_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/872be830-c457-4399-9922-a465b43b29ff","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/872be830-c457-4399-9922-a465b43b29ff_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"Figure 1C. \"We hypothesized that mutations in HYOU1 ATPase domain would impair ATP hydrolysis, thereby hampering the conformational changes required for HYOU1 chaperone function.

Studies provide evidence for a novel mechanism of transcriptional regulation of ORP150 by the stress-induced transcription factor CHOP, which is upregulated by both ER and mitochondrial-specific stressors. The localization of ORP150 to the mitochondria may provide an alternative mechanism for the anti-apoptotic activity of this chaperone molecule seen in numerous in vitro and in vivo models.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18094145","rdfs:label":"ER and mitochondria ","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"evidenceStrength":"Limited","sequence":9883,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria11","strengthScore":1.9,"subject":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/GmFLuXnwIJM","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0009305","gene":"hgnc:16931","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","websiteLegacyID":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/assertion_a1d9da94-991f-4fea-aabe-484578dfb2eb-","@context":{"@vocab":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"},"curationReasons":{"@type":"@vocab","@container":"@set"},"GCISnapshot":{"@type":"@id"},"dc:isVersionOf":{"@type":"@id"},"websiteLegacyID":{"@type":"@id"}}}
