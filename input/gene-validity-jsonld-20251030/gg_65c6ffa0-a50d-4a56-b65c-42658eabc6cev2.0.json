Three genes, CACNA1A, ATP1A2, and SCN1A, have been associated with FHM1, FHM2, and FHM3, respectively. Additional phenotypes such as epilepsy and elicited repetitive daily blindness may be present in some FHM3 patients; however, other phenotypes such as ataxia and intellectual disability reported in FHM1-2 are rare in FHM3. The penetrance of FHM3 is  close to 100%. FHM was first reported to be associated with SCN1A in 2005 in a study that identified a SCN1A variant segregating with FHM in three families (Dichgans et al. 2005 PMID: 16054936). Since then, 12 missense variants in SCN1A have been reported to be associated with FHM, including one de novo variant (PMID: 27155821). One of the 11 inherited variants (c.3521C>G; p.Thr1174Ser in NM_001165963.1) has a relatively high frequency in the general population, and is considered a benign polymorphism. The remaining 10 inherited variants and the de novo variant are rare variants not observed in  gnomAD version 2.11. The 10 inherited rare variants from 16 families have been reported in 11 studies (16054936, 17397047, 19332696, 29145747, 30498473, 19220312, 24707016, 26763045, 26747084, 27919014, 30038559). Of the 16 families, 11 were given points ranging from 0.1 to 0.5 based on case-level and experimental data. A summed LOD score of 8.61 was calculated from the combined three families in the seminal paper as well as two other families (16054936, 17397047, 19332696). Supporting experimental evidence includes expression and biochemical functional studies (17537961). The accepted mechanism of hemiplegic migraine aura is cortical spreading depression, and mouse models of FHM1 and FHM2 support this theory. Since effects of FHM3 variants in SCN1A are often complex and diverse, the exact mechanisms by which defects in SCN1A could cause cortical spreading depression are unclear; however, SCN1A expression in axonal segments such as axon initial segments and the nodes of Ranvier, and the function in maintenance of action potentials are consistent with SCN1A’s role in neuronal activity and brain excitability, processes related to cortical spreading depression. In summary, a score of 6.5 was given to genetic evidence, and 1 to experimental evidence, reaching 7.5 in total. SCN1A’s association with FHM is moderate.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/65c6ffa0-a50d-4a56-b65c-42658eabc6ce","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c8c1e158-983d-4547-a739-7781961e5bb8","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","changes":[{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c8c1e158-983d-4547-a739-7781961e5bb8_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10005","date":"2021-09-14T16:34:26.485Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c8c1e158-983d-4547-a739-7781961e5bb8_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10005","date":"2021-09-14T16:34:08.306Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c8c1e158-983d-4547-a739-7781961e5bb8_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c8c1e158-983d-4547-a739-7781961e5bb8_seg_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1b6851ea-fe64-48a2-b9b1-1e9d5bf82013_proband_segregation","type":"FamilyCosegregation","dc:description":"LOD score not high enough for inclusion.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30498473","rdfs:label":"Shao2018","estimatedLodScore":0.9,"family":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1b6851ea-fe64-48a2-b9b1-1e9d5bf82013","type":"Family","rdfs:label":"Shao2018","ethnicity":{"id":"cg:NotHispanicOrLatino"},"member":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/237db9a5-5673-43c4-9a85-b0bae65a98c2","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30498473","rdfs:label":"II-3","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageValue":17,"allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6c441f03-0f9b-4baa-b526-5564e61045f7","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001165963.4(SCN1A):c.4495T>C (p.Phe1499Leu)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA256620"}},"detectionMethod":"Genetic test was done on ATP1A2, CACNA1A and SCN1A on at least the symptomatic 4 members of the family, but it's not clear what methods were used, NGS, or Sanger.

This variant has been described by another group in a Chinese family with FHM. Then they trasnfected tsA201 cells with wild type and variant SCN1A and studied the electrophysiological properties of the variant NaV1.1 channel. The variant channel had reduced current density which was rescued by incubation at low temperatures (30C vs 37C), which suggests trafficking defects. The rescued currents of the variant NaV1.1 had both LOF and GOF effects with overall GOF effects that resulted in increased response to repetitive stimuli with resistance to use dependence. Then they transfected mouse neocortical neurons with the variant and wild type SCN1A with the TTX resistant p.F383S variant and eletrophysiological properties were studied with 1 uM TTX. The current density was significantly reduced, but still rescued compared to tsA201 cells at 37C with 50% current density compared to wild type. The variant channel had positively shifted voltage dependence of channel activation, which is an LOF effect, and positively shifted voltage dependence of fast inactivation and increased persistent current, which were GOF effects. When they applied repetitive stimuli similar to those in neuronal firing, the first current was slightly larger in wild type, but last currents were significantly higher in neurons expressing the variant channel. This is consistent with overall GOF effects and hyperexcitability. They have hypothesized that hyperexcitability of GABAergic neurons could cause extracellular potassium and neurotransmitter accumulation, inducing neuronal depolarization and initiation of cortical spreading depression, a wave of transient network hyperexcitability leading to a long-lasting depolarization block of neuronal firing that is a proposed pathological mechanism of migraine.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30038559","rdfs:label":"Dhifallah2018Fig6"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/52e38a06-56a9-4757-9f74-81eb84977b89","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"This data is best treated as variant level functional evidence.

In the first half of this study, the authors showed this trafficking defects can be rescued by expressing the variant channel at lower temperatures (30C vs 37C), or co-expressing the channel with other accessory proteins (ankyrin G or calmodulin). After this rescue, the variant channel was found to have mixed LOF and GOF effects leading to overall GOF effects in the tsA201 cells. \nCultured mouse embryo cortical neurons were transfected with wild type or c.4946T>A SCN1A that also harbors the p.F383S  alteration that would render the channel insensitive to 1 uM TTX. By recording these neurons under 1 uM TTX, electrophysiological properties of exogenous channels were studied independently from the endogenous sodium currents. First by whole-cell patch-clamping recordings, they found that overall current density was smaller and  activation was slower in neurons transfected with the variant channel, which are LOF effects. However, The development of fast inactivation was slower, the voltage dependence of the fast inactivation was positively shifted, and persistent current was larger in neurons transfected with the variant channels, which are GOF effects. These effects are mostly consistent with the experiments in tsA201. Importantly, neurons did not need to be cultured at lower temperatures in order to partially rescue the trafficking defects of the variant channel. Then they studied the effects of repetitive stimuli similar to neuronal firing. Neurons expressing the variant channels had much larger firing than neurons expressing wild type channels, even without normalization to the maximal current for the neuron. Then they also studied more physiological condition by recording the variant and wild type channels without 1 uM TTX, which would have endogenous sodium currents in response to prolonged current injections of increasing magnitudes. Again, neurons expressing the variant channels fired with higher frequency than did neurons expressing WT neurons. By in silico modeling, they estimated that the neurons expressing the variant channels need to have only 35% rescue of trafficking to have higher firing frequency. Taken together, the p.L1649Q NaV1.1 channel has overall GOF effects and hyperexcitability in GABAergic neurons.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24101488","rdfs:label":"Cestele2013bFig3_5"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/72d9814f-1c9e-4c41-b232-ac678275be27","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"This data is best treated as variant level functional evidence.

They claimed that endogenous sodium currents of these neurons are small, enabling them to study sodium currents of exogenous SCN1A. The electrophysiological properties of the neurons transfected with the variant SCN1A were similar to tsA201 cells when they were recorded in the cell-attached macropatch configuration: 36% reduction in peak current, unchanged voltage dependence of channel activation, and positive shift of voltage dependence of fast inactivation. But unlike tsA201 cells, persistent current could not be recorded in either wild type or the variant. These are mixed GOF and LOF effects. Then they recorded the neuron's response to a stimulation protocol simulating neuronal discharges recorded from neocortical slices (initial frequency of 208 Hz gradually decreased 37 Hz). They found that the neurons expressing the variant channel had significantly larger firing than did the wild type. Note that since the current was normalized to the maximum current for each neuron, which was smaller in the variant, the actual size of the firing may not be larger in neurons expressing the variant channel than those expressing wild type channel. However, after a long depolarization, the variant-expressing neurons had smaller firing than did WT-expressing neurons, suggesting that the variant had limited hyperexcitability in neurons. They also did a current clamp experiments on neurons expressing wild type or the variant NaV1.1 by applying 2.5 s long current steps of varying degree to these neurons. They found that the neurons expressing the variant are able to fire faster than did those neurons expressing wild type SCN1A, although again, the variant-expressing neurons also required larger current stimuli than did the wild type to fire, probably due to lower maximal current density. They also showed that this hyperexcitability of the variant channel is less pronounced after prolonged stimuli. In summary, with a caveat of lower maximal current density, the variant SCN1A confers limited hyperexcitability to neurons. This hyperexcitability may contribute to the generation of cortical spreading depression underlying aura symptom of FHM patients.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18632931","rdfs:label":"Cestele2008Fig5_7"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"evidenceStrength":"Moderate","sequence":3355,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria7","strengthScore":7.5,"subject":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/yO-y9bFcQlc","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0000700","gene":"hgnc:10585","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"2.0","websiteLegacyID":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/assertion_c8c1e158-983d-4547-a739-7781961e5bb8-","@context":{"@vocab":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"},"curationReasons":{"@type":"@vocab","@container":"@set"},"GCISnapshot":{"@type":"@id"},"dc:isVersionOf":{"@type":"@id"},"websiteLegacyID":{"@type":"@id"}}}
