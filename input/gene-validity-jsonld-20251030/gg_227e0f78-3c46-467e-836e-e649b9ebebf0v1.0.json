Provides structure/regulation to the foot process of podocytes and the slit diaphragm (PMID: 11733557). In the kidney, *CD2AP* is primarily expressed in glomerular podocytes, and its absence results in improper formation of the slit diaphragm (PMID: 10514378) and the protein filtration barrier of the kidney (PMID: 16889564).\n\nMultiple disease entities have been reported in association with this gene. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, there was evidence of differences in their inheritance pattern. Therefore, the following disease entities have been split into multiple disease entities: autosomal dominant focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) (OMIM:607832) and autosomal recessive FSGS (OMIM:607832). Autosomal dominant FSGS has been curated separately.\n\n*CD2AP* was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive FSGS in 2007 (Löwik et al., PMID: 17713465). FSGS is a pathologic entity associated clinically with proteinuria, nephrotic syndrome (NPHS), and progressive loss of renal function. It is a common cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) (PMID: 16932363). The mechanism of pathogenicity is known to be loss of function.\n\nFour variants (nonsense and frameshift) have been reported in four probands in four publications (PMIDs: 17713465, 30348286, 30612599, 36964972) included in this curation. A total of 7.1/12 pts. for genetic evidence was reached considering case-level data.\n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by functional studies, expression studies, and animal models. One mouse model with homozygous knock-in of c.592_593insTCAC (p.Ser198IlefsTer3), which is also observed in a patient with FSGS, phenocopied FSGS (PMIDs: 30612599). Additionally, *CD2AP* expression is observed in the glomerular basement membrane and is required for proper formation of the slit diaphragm and the protein filtration barrier of the kidney (PMID: 10514378, 10997929, 16889564). A total of 5/6 pts. for experimental evidence was reached.\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *CD2AP* and autosomal recessive focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time.\n\nThis classification was approved by the ClinGen Glomerulopathy GCEP on the meeting date April 8, 2024 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/227e0f78-3c46-467e-836e-e649b9ebebf0","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e4bd2904-da48-4a7d-875e-bc90d56f59da","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e4bd2904-da48-4a7d-875e-bc90d56f59da_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10068","date":"2024-04-08T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e4bd2904-da48-4a7d-875e-bc90d56f59da_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10068","date":"2024-09-27T16:50:01.290Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e4bd2904-da48-4a7d-875e-bc90d56f59da_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d7b9d497-99cc-41be-9f4b-7e50465cfae4_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/97e8eb17-15ae-4196-a685-b8b3f49adda4","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Score reduced to 0.1 total as NMD is not predicted.
