{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b49e3eac-9e0d-4e6b-bb7d-0f5ebbe8da29v2.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"*TPM4* was first reported in relation to inherited thrombocytopenia in 2017 (Pleines et al, PMID: 28134622). TPM4 encodes tropomyosin alpha 4 chain. Tropomyosins are dimers of coiled‐coil proteins that provide stability to the actin filaments in which they bind, regulating access of other actin‐binding proteins. *TPM4*- related platelet disorder (Bleeding Disorder, Platelet Type, 25) is an autosomal dominant platelet disorder characterized by variable thrombocytopenia, increased platelet size, and mild platelet dysfunction. Evidence supporting this gene-disease curation includes case-level data and experimental data.   \n\nSummary of Case Level Data (4 points): Four unique variants have been reported in humans; two nonsense variants and two missense variants. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 5 probands in 3 publications (Plienes et al, PMID: 28134622; Stapley et al, PMID: 34758189; Marin-Quilez et al, PMID:35170221). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in an additional 8 family members.\n\nSummary of Experimental Data (3 points): This gene disease relationship is supported by an animal model (Pleines et al, PMID: 28134622), Biochemical Function (Stapley et al, PMID: 34758189) and expression studies (Pleines et al, PMID: 28134622).\n\nIn summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship.  Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship.\n\nThis gene-disease classification was originally approved by the ClinGen Hemostasis and Thrombosis (H/T) Gene Curation Expert Panel on February 3, 2022 and re-evaluated on May 1, 2024. No new scoreable genetic or experimental evidence has emerged since the original curation date and as a result, the classification did not change.  The ClinGen H/T expert panel is aware of an additional, unpublished case in which an individual with isolated thrombocytopenia and no family history of platelet or bleeding disorders is noted.  The variant, *TPM4* (NM_001145160.1) c.572_574del, p.G191del results in an in-frame deletion of a single amino acid (CA2576659843).  At this time, this variant is not scored in this curation.\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b49e3eac-9e0d-4e6b-bb7d-0f5ebbe8da29","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0b8bb90f-f190-4e20-8f65-27d236cb7d79","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","changes":[{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"},{"id":"cg:sopChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0b8bb90f-f190-4e20-8f65-27d236cb7d79_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2024-05-08T17:54:55.791Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0b8bb90f-f190-4e20-8f65-27d236cb7d79_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2024-05-01T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["RecurationTiming"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0b8bb90f-f190-4e20-8f65-27d236cb7d79_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0b8bb90f-f190-4e20-8f65-27d236cb7d79_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/80277101-7923-4b01-b60d-a52fe8930dfe","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9384b25e-bd42-4d27-9367-dba24cd02ef9","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Western blot analysis measured protein level of controls as well as individuals harboring the R105* (R69*) variant in TPM4.
