A single missense variant, p.Val1490Ile, segregated in 2 affected family members with HCM and destabilized dimerization of the MYOM1 protein; however, variants in all 8 sarcomeric genes were not ruled out (Siegert et al, 2011, PMID 21256114). Nine additional missense variants, one intronic variant, one splice-site variant, and a synonymous variant are included in this curation. All but one received reduced scores either due to the presence of variants in other HCM genes, inconsistent phenotypes, or high allele frequencies in gnomAD (Cecconi M, et al., 2016, PMID: 27600940; Bottillo I, et al., 2016, PMID: 26656175; Guo X, et al., 2017, PMID: 28323875). The mechanism for disease is unknown.This gene-disease relationship is supported by an expression study (Schoenauer et al, 2011, PMID 21069531). This gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the ClinGen Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Gene Curation Expert Panel on July 20th, 2017. It was reevaluated by the Hereditary Cardiovascular Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on February 23rd, 2023. As a result of this reevaluation, the classification was changed from limited to disputed.\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7e2ab461-2151-4bd7-9255-0a4a97119c63","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8ff00fbf-6b20-49cd-8af8-0f6404240db5","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","changes":[{"id":"cg:classificationChange"},{"id":"cg:sopChange"},{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},{"id":"cg:expertPanelChange"},{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"},{"id":"cg:newEvidence"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8ff00fbf-6b20-49cd-8af8-0f6404240db5_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10104","date":"2023-04-12T22:17:51.692Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8ff00fbf-6b20-49cd-8af8-0f6404240db5_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10104","date":"2023-02-23T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"Given the reduction in score upon recuration and the lack of new evidence, this gene-disease association has been moved from limited to disputed.
