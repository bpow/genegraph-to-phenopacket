At least 13 unique variants (e.g. missense, nonsense, frameshift, large deletion, etc.) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 10 probands in 4 publications (PMIDs: 23890588, 10775527, 27604308, 23570448). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 2 additional family members. Of note, this gene has also been implicated in Saccharopinuria but no putative causal variants have been identified in patients. This gene-disease relationship is supported by its biochemical function in lysine catabolism and a knock-in mouse model which recapitulates the human phenotype of hyperlysinemia (PMID: 35135854). In summary, *AASS* is definitively associated with autosomal recessive hyperlysinemia. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.\n\nThis gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the Aminoacidopathy GCEP on 06/29/2020. It was re-evaluated on 10/14/2022. As a result of this reevaluation, the classification increased from Moderate to Definitive with the addition of a new mouse model (PMIDs: 35135854).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/396eebfa-ea08-4d20-9011-429b4b4aa01b","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/92e04f9e-f03e-4295-baac-e9fb6b48a258","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":[{"id":"cg:sopChange"},{"id":"cg:newEvidence"},{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"},{"id":"cg:classificationChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/92e04f9e-f03e-4295-baac-e9fb6b48a258_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10011","date":"2022-10-17T14:38:16.657Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/92e04f9e-f03e-4295-baac-e9fb6b48a258_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10011","date":"2022-10-14T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/92e04f9e-f03e-4295-baac-e9fb6b48a258_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/625de04c-287a-478a-bb85-8ca64293c066_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/625de04c-287a-478a-bb85-8ca64293c066","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23890588","rdfs:label":"Case 2","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":8,"allele":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d509b61b-4f1c-4042-b65a-b245adbf3158","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_005763.4(AASS):c.976_977del (p.Gln326GlufsTer28)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/100644"}},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/021b6a4c-3165-40d0-b536-879f5a9284cc","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_005763.4(AASS):c.1925C>G (p.Ser642Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/100645"}}],"detectionMethod":"Genomic DNA and cDNA were obtained from the peripheral white blood cells using standard methods.
