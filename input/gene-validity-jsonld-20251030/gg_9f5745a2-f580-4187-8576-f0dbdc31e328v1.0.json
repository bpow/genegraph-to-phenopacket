This association was made using case-level data only. At least 7​ variants (missense, nonsense, frameshift) have been reported in humans. EYA4​ was first associated with this disease in humans as early as 2001 (Wayne et al.​). Association is seen in at least 7​ probands in 6​ publications (11159937, ​17568404, 25681523, 25963406, 25242383, 26331839). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in >70 additional family members. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. Of note, at least one patient and a zebrafish model have been reported with a cardiac phenotype (Schonberger et al. 2005, 15735644). This gene-disease association is supported by a mouse model and expression studies. In summary, EYA4​ is definitively associated with autosomal dominant nonsyndromic hearing loss. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hearing Loss​ Working Group on 1/5/2018.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9f5745a2-f580-4187-8576-f0dbdc31e328","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/21c75059-bd7b-48ef-a828-28ffebe52ca0","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/21c75059-bd7b-48ef-a828-28ffebe52ca0_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2018-01-05T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/21c75059-bd7b-48ef-a828-28ffebe52ca0_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/21c75059-bd7b-48ef-a828-28ffebe52ca0_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/21c75059-bd7b-48ef-a828-28ffebe52ca0_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/02518e71-9540-4d22-9a1c-de77e6bf1770","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Evidence that loss of Eya4 can cause hearing loss, but other effects of miR-431 overexpression were not excluded","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6aeed337-165b-4b09-b1ca-e80587125581","type":"Finding","dc:description":"The micro RNA miR-431 was studied for role in hearing.
