{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a6c44e9c-420e-459b-8986-ce6755b207ccv1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"INS was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant monogenic diabetes in 2007 (Støy, et al., PMID: 17855560) and studies of large case series reported in 2008 indicated INS mutations as the second most common cause of permanent neonatal diabetes. While most reported cases are diagnosed with diabetes before 6 months of age, diabetes is less commonly diagnosed later in infancy or early childhood, as well as rarely in adolescence or early adulthood (PMID: 18162506, 18292540), sometimes referred to as MODY10 (MIM:613370). The mechanism for disease in the majority of cases is expected to be toxic gain of function, related to misfolding of the proinsulin molecule leading to ER stress and apoptosis (PMID:  9884331); consequently, these cases usually require and respond best to insulin treatment. Of note, a few studies have found such INS mutations in approximately 7% of patients who had been clinically diagnosed with type 1 diabetes in early childhood but were negative for pancreatic autoantibodies. A few INS variants appear to have distinct mechanisms affecting properties such as protein stability and/or binding to the insulin receptor. Patients with these variants appear more likely to be diagnosed with diabetes in adolescence or early adulthood and may respond to oral hypoglycemic agents (PMID: 18192540).  \n\n \n\nNumerous variants have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data. Summary of case-level and experimental data: 17.6 points. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 11 probands in 7 publications (PMIDs: 17855560, 25721872, 816250, 20007936, 18192540, 19900242, 30182532, 28992123). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 11 additional family members. A score of 11.6 was achieved for genetic data. This gene-disease association is supported by expression studies, animal models, and in vitro functional assays. In summary, INS is definitively associated with autosomal dominant monogenic diabetes. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. \n\n \n\nPer criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting working group, we found differences in molecular mechanisms, inheritance patterns, and phenotypic variability underlying the INS-related disease entities.  Therefore, we have split curations for these disease entities.  \n\nThe present curation includes (1) autosomal dominant monogenic diabetes mellitus, which most often presents in infancy and is usually referred to as permanent neonatal diabetes (MIM: 606176), but may also occur in patients with antibody-negative type 1 diabetes in early childhood, or rarely in adolescence or young adulthood and may be referred to as maturity-onset diabetes of the young 10, (MODY10, MIM:613370). Other entities requiring separate curations include (2) Autosomal recessive diabetes mellitus (usually permanent neonatal; MIM: 606176) and (3) Hyperproinsulinemia (MIM: 616214). Type 1 diabetes (polygenic, MIM: 125852) will not be curated at this time since the contribution of INS is in the form of common variants with a small effect.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a6c44e9c-420e-459b-8986-ce6755b207cc","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c5224322-637e-40a8-89eb-d44e01536f25","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c5224322-637e-40a8-89eb-d44e01536f25_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10016","date":"2020-09-16T19:23:13.091Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c5224322-637e-40a8-89eb-d44e01536f25_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10016","date":"2020-05-13T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c5224322-637e-40a8-89eb-d44e01536f25_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c5224322-637e-40a8-89eb-d44e01536f25_ad_dn_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4eedc2af-4f65-460f-a705-5d4ebedfafc1_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f2d7fc26-27d0-4cab-ae1c-91d0bfc307e1","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19900242","rdfs:label":"G32S","ageType":"AgeAtDiagnosis","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":15,"detectionMethod":"genomic

For the first 2hrs, proinsulin secretion into media was similar between both cells lines, however for CHO-Ins2Mody it decreased with time.
