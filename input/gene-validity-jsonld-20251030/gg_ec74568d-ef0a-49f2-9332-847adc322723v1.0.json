The DLD gene encodes dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase, a flavoprotein component known as E3 that is common to the four 2-oxoacid dehydrogenase multienzyme complexes, namely, pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC), 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (OGDC), branched-chain 2-oxoacid dehydrogenase complex (BCKDC) and 2-oxoadipate dehydrogenase complex (OADC). PDC catalyzes conversion of pyruvate into acetyl-CoA, thus is the link between glycolysis and the citric acid cycle. PDC deficiency leads to impaired energy metabolism.\n\nThe DLD gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Leigh syndrome spectrum in 1993 (PMID: 8506365). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included 11 variants identified in seven cases in seven publications (PMIDs: 8506365, 23290025, 11687750, 16770810, 27144126, 8968745, 12925875). Of note, many U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel members have cared for affected individuals with Leigh syndrome spectrum and pathogenic variants in DLD which have not been published in the medical literature. No segregation data were available. Loss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease association is also supported by biochemical function, expression data, and functional alteration in non-patient cells (PMIDs: 27977873, 25613900, 21930696). \n\nAlthough the final score for this gene-disease curation was 11 (typically moderate classification), the expert panel agreed to move this classification to definitive given the many cases followed in the experts’ clinics with Leigh syndrome spectrum and DLD pathogenic variants.\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support this gene-disease relationship, including that more than three years have elapsed from the first proposal of the gene-disease association. This classification was approved by the NICHD U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on April 20, 2020 (SOP Version 7).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ec74568d-ef0a-49f2-9332-847adc322723","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/990dd96f-16ec-4c0f-a46b-ce4a647b7a50","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/990dd96f-16ec-4c0f-a46b-ce4a647b7a50_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2021-03-11T17:12:46.198Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/990dd96f-16ec-4c0f-a46b-ce4a647b7a50_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2021-03-11T17:13:00.451Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"Although the final score for this gene-disease curation was 11 (typically moderate classification), the expert panel agreed to move this classification to definitive given the many cases followed in the experts’ clinics with Leigh syndrome spectrum and DLD pathogenic variants.","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/990dd96f-16ec-4c0f-a46b-ce4a647b7a50_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/dd4552b9-eafe-4c71-8ae0-919fc85e4020_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The expression of PDHc E2/E3BP and E1α subunits was reduced (45.2% and 59.7%, respectively)","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7af4229d-7598-400f-ba18-f65924dec532","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27144126","rdfs:label":"Patient PZ","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":18,"ethnicity":{"id":"cg:UnknownEthnicity"},"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"Leigh syndrome diagnosis\nOnset at 1.5 years but diagnosed 9 years\nDevelopmental delay >3 years, hypotonia, Dysarthria, ptosis, \nMRI: Brain atrophy, corpus callosum hypoplasia, demyelination, basl ganglia abnormalities (no image presented)\nElevated blood and CSF lactate\nText description: This girl was born by cesarean section with a birth weight of 3250 g and Apgar score of 9 points.
