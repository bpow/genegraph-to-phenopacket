The maximum amount of scorable genetic evidence has been published showing the de novo p.Ser2Gly variant occurs in SHOC2 in patients with NS/LAH (Cordeddu et al., 2009; Galperin, Abdelmoti, & Sorkin, 2012; Motta et al., 2016). Additionally, the p.Met173Ile variant has been identified in one family with disease (Hannig, Jeoung, Jang, Phillips, & Galperin, 2014). The SHOC2 gene is also associated with the Ras/MAPK pathway, which is associated with the NS/LAH phenotype and variants found in NS/LAH patients in this gene disrupt the RAS pathway function as demonstrated by C. elegans models (Cordeddu et al., 2009; Gripp et al., 2016). Of note, SHOC2 is also classified as Disputed in association with NS, cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome, and Costello syndrome. The ClinGen RASopathy Expert Panel found no evidence associating SHOC2 with NS with multiple lentigines. This curation was approved by the ClinGen RASopathy Gene Curation Expert Panel on 7/25/18 (SOP Version 5).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/de79dbb0-8f6e-4007-917e-7de8cfb750bc","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0ecc1335-fb21-4d65-8df2-19558e8f5c07","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0ecc1335-fb21-4d65-8df2-19558e8f5c07_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10021","date":"2018-07-25T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0ecc1335-fb21-4d65-8df2-19558e8f5c07_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10021","date":"2021-03-10T14:25:33.508Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0ecc1335-fb21-4d65-8df2-19558e8f5c07_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0ecc1335-fb21-4d65-8df2-19558e8f5c07_ad_dn_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ee44b52e-5a02-4ce5-a55f-3400d7dde1cb_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"This study screened 92 patients with Noonan syndrome with mutations in other known Noonan genes.
