{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7fa48eaa-dadf-4fa8-b49d-a8d448e3b828v1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"The relationship between *FOXRED1* and primary mitochondrial disease was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of August 21, 2023. *FOXRED1* encodes FAD-dependent oxidoreductase domain-containing protein 1, a protein involved in the mid-late stages of mitochondrial complex I assembly that is predicted to also contain FAD and oxygen binding sites. \n\n*FOXRED1* was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive primary mitochondrial disease in 2010 (PMID:20858599), in a 10-year-old Iranian male with Leigh syndrome, hepatomegaly, and cardiomyopathy. Other associated features have been reported over time. While various names could be given to the constellation of features seen in those with *FOXRED1*-related disorders, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *FOXRED1* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework. Of note, *FOXRED1* was first curated by this GCEP for its association with Leigh syndrome spectrum (LSS) on October 14, 2019 (SOP v7), with a final classification of Moderate. This current curation for the association with primary mitochondrial disease includes cases with LSS.\n\nEvidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included eight unique variants (four nonsense and frameshift variants resulting in truncation, four missense variants) in five probands across four publications (PMIDs: 20858599, 20818383, 30723688, 33613441). Features in affected individuals include LSS, cystic leukoencephalopathy, epilepsy, hepatomegaly, cardiomyopathy, pulmonary hypertension, renal tubular acidosis, and optic atrophy. Lactic acidosis is also seen.\n\nThis gene-disease association is also supported by its known biochemical function shared with other complex I subunits and assembly factors, functional alteration in patient cells, siRNA knockdown in mouse neurons, and rescue of complex I assembly in HEK293T cells (PMIDs: 25678554, 28797839, 30392038, 22200994). \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between *FOXRED1* and primary mitochondrial disease. This has been repeatedly demonstrated and upheld over time, and no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts this gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on August 21, 2023 (SOP Version 9).
