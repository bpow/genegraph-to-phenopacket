{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/56b288a0-88f9-4f23-aac0-392cb909570av1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"The relationship between *MT-TR* and primary mitochondrial disease was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of March 4, 2024. The *MT-TR* gene encodes the mitochondrial transfer RNA (tRNA) for arginine. Defects of this tRNA lead to impaired mitochondrial translation, which leads to decreased synthesis of mtDNA-encoded subunits of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes I, III, IV, and V, resulting in impaired OXPHOS enzyme activities. \n\n*MT-TR* was first reported in relation to maternally inherited primary mitochondrial disease in 2004 in an individual with mitochondrial encephalomyopathy (PMID: 15286228). While various names have been given to the constellation of features seen in those with *MT-TR*-related disease, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *MT-TR* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework.\n\nEvidence supporting the gene-disease relationship between *MT-TR* and primary mitochondrial disease includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included four variants (m.10406G>A, m.10437G>A, m.10438A>G, m.10450A>G) in four probands in four publications (PMIDs: 15286228, 17588757, 19809478, 22781096). Cybrid studies (PMID: 19809478) and single fiber testing (PMID: 22781096) further supported the pathogenicity of several of these variants. Age of onset was in childhood and features seen in affected individuals included muscle weakness, ataxia, hypotonia, epilepsy, global developmental delay and regression, pigmentary retinopathy, optic atrophy, renal insufficiency, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Muscle biopsies showed ragged red fibers and COX-negative fibers and variable respiratory chain enzyme deficiencies.\n\nThe mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss of function due to altered RNA secondary structure. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by known biochemical function and in vitro functional assays demonstrating reduced rates of mitochondrial translation as a result of variants in *MT-TR* (PMIDs: 19809478, 33340416).  \n\nIn summary, there is moderate evidence to support the relationship between *MT-TR* and primary mitochondrial disease. No convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts this gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on March 4, 2024 (SOP Version 10).

The full mtDNA genome for each cybrid line was determined and compared to detect variants, taking C57BL/6J as their reference. This revealed two variants in the NIH3T3 mtDNA: m.9461T>C, which results in a synonymous substitution in mt-Nd3, and mt-Tr m.9821insAA. ND3 transcript levels were not affected by the synonymous variant (Fig. S3), suggesting that any functional differences observed are due to the dinucleotide insertion in mt-Tr. \n\nThe authors found that the NIH3T3 cybrids generated significantly higher levels of hydrogen peroxide than their reference strain (Fig. 2A). This was accompanied by increases in catalase activity (a proxy for ROS protective genes, Fig. 2B) and the mtDNA/nDNA ratio (Fig. 2C). Given that ROS are known to induce mitochondrial proliferation, they treated cells with one of two antioxidants (NAC or Tiron), and found that H2O2 production and the mtDNA/nDNA ratio were equivalent across all strains. \n\nThey also tested MRC enzyme activity and O2 consumption rates across their lines. No significant differences of MRC enzyme activity were observed (Figs. 1B, 4), nor were any differences observed for O2 consumption (Fig. 1A). However, when treated with NAC or Tiron, the O2 consumption rates dropped in the NIH3T3 cells compared to the reference. This suggests that an underlying respiratory defect was being masked by increased proliferation of mitochondria in response to ROS. \n\nFurther evidence for this comes from differences in growth rates on glucose vs galactose medium. Under normal conditions, there were no significant differences in cell doubling time for NIH3T3 cells grown in either media (Fig. 1C, panel 1). However, when NAC was added to the media, the doubling time was ~2.5-fold longer; the addition of Tiron abolished growth on galactose (Fig. 1C, panels 2, 3). No similar effect was observed for the reference strain, suggesting that cells carrying the m.9821insAA variant require ROS-induced mt proliferation to survive on galactose. \n","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17013393","rdfs:label":"ROS in Mouse Cybrids","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCellCultureModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":0}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6ef40a42-d2c5-4770-a251-7e2c0b0ce96a_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2c48dca0-7d93-448e-a589-2ea55d665091","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5d06afe6-775f-48d2-b282-f791660eec4c","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"The authors performed in vitro pulse labeling of patient fibroblasts with radiolabeled sulfur to assess disruptions of mitochondrial translation rates.
