The phenotype is usually permanent neonatal diabetes with intrauterine growth retardation requiring insulin treatment, but some individuals who are homozygous or compound heterozygous for INS regulatory variants were reported to have transient neonatal diabetes (diagnosed in early infancy but diabetes was in clinical remission at the time of publication after limited follow-up period) or diabetes diagnosed outside the neonatal period rather than permanent neonatal diabetes (Garin et al., PMID:20133622).  At least 11 unique variants have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Summary of case-level and experimental data: 16 points. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 12 probands in 6 publications (PMIDS: 31441606, 26101329, 27487489, 25755231, 23245869, 20133622). The mechanism for disease is expected to be loss of function. This gene-disease association is supported by expression studies, animal models, and cell culture models. In summary, INS is definitively associated with autosomal recessive permanent neonatal diabetes. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. \n\n \n\nPer criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting working group, we found differences in molecular mechanisms, inheritance patterns, and phenotypic variability underlying the disease entities associated with INS. Therefore, we have split curations for these disease entities. The present curation refers to the entity of autosomal recessive permanent neonatal diabetes (MIM: 606176) with some rare transient neonatal of older onset cases.  Other entities being curated separately include (1) autosomal dominant monogenic diabetes, which comprises OMIM entries autosomal dominant neonatal diabetes (MIM:  606176) and maturity-onset diabetes of the young 10 (MODY10; MIM:613370) and (2) hyperproinsulinemia (MIM: 616214). Type 1 diabetes (polygenic; MIM: 125852) will not be curated at this time since the contribution of INS is in the form of common variants with a small effect.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/76f6c4d1-9e73-4295-bad6-890204295d7b","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9c21ba4d-785f-486f-84f8-511b9c89c137","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9c21ba4d-785f-486f-84f8-511b9c89c137_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10016","date":"2021-01-28T20:27:54.949Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9c21ba4d-785f-486f-84f8-511b9c89c137_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10016","date":"2020-05-13T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9c21ba4d-785f-486f-84f8-511b9c89c137_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9c21ba4d-785f-486f-84f8-511b9c89c137_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/42c7e235-acc1-4f6a-9978-70adf4fcad02","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Primary
