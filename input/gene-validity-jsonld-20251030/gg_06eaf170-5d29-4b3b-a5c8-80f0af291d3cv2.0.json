Meier-Gorlin syndrome 4 is a syndromic disorder characterized by short stature, ​​missing patellae, small ears, and microcephaly. Many individuals also have distinctive facial features, with small, low set ears, microstomia, micrognathia, full lips, and a narrow nose with a high nasal bridge. At least two missense, one intragenic deletion, one frameshift, and one nonsense variant have been reported in four probands in two publications (PMID: 21358631; Marinakis et al., 2021, PMID: 34008892). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes functional alteration of patient cells, biochemical function, and protein-protein interactions (Stiff et al., 2013, PMID: 23516378; McDaniel et al., 2020, PMID: 31818869). The mechanism of disease is currently unknown. In summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged. This gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the ClinGen Syndromic Disorders GCEP on February 17, 2023 (SOP Version 9). It was reevaluated on April 14, 2025. There was no new evidence. As a result of this reevaluation, the classification did not change.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/06eaf170-5d29-4b3b-a5c8-80f0af291d3c","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d00eb95c-5496-4051-a4e1-c327b71fe6e4","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","changes":[{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},{"id":"cg:sopChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d00eb95c-5496-4051-a4e1-c327b71fe6e4_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10060","date":"2025-06-30T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d00eb95c-5496-4051-a4e1-c327b71fe6e4_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10060","date":"2025-07-01T01:08:21.020Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["RecurationTiming"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d00eb95c-5496-4051-a4e1-c327b71fe6e4_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/04234ca2-12e4-4149-841a-878d06d6f359_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/04234ca2-12e4-4149-841a-878d06d6f359","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21358631","rdfs:label":"1652","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":5,"allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/96bee013-c99d-4c68-a5ad-09dd52bb89ad","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_181741.4(ORC4):c.521A>G (p.Tyr174Cys)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA129097"}},"detectionMethod":"To map a potential locus for Meier-Gorlin syndrome, they performed high density genome-wide SNP genotyping.
