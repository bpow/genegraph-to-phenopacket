Affected individuals in this family exhibited intellectual disability, dysmorphic features, and strabismus. The condition was referred to by the authors as MRAMS syndrome (for mental retardation, anterior maxillary protrusion, and strabismus, OMIM: 613671) (Vanagaite et al., PMID: 17618476). Given the phenotypic variability of the syndromic neurodevelopmental features of affected individuals, we opted to curate this gene for “syndromic intellectual disability” and disease entities related to SOBP variants have been lumped into one disease entity.\nAt this time, a single nonsense variant has been reported in one proband (PMID: 21035105). This variant segregated with disease in six additional family members. In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism Expert Panel on October 18, 2022 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a30bdcb9-5e15-40f7-8fb9-edf379cceb23","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3edc996d-92e2-4556-947e-5a298cf1341d","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3edc996d-92e2-4556-947e-5a298cf1341d_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2022-10-18T06:30:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3edc996d-92e2-4556-947e-5a298cf1341d_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2023-02-19T12:52:03.338Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3edc996d-92e2-4556-947e-5a298cf1341d_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3edc996d-92e2-4556-947e-5a298cf1341d_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b603cec3-6d79-449a-964d-31715ccfe3af_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/dcb1ce2d-d6cd-4dd1-ab7b-1934edb9a82c","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":3.0,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/dcb1ce2d-d6cd-4dd1-ab7b-1934edb9a82c_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21035105","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e33ee5c8-4e79-445b-b3d7-24fab1154615","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_018013.4(SOBP):c.1981C>T (p.Arg661Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA113783"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":3.0},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b603cec3-6d79-449a-964d-31715ccfe3af","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21035105","rdfs:label":"Brik-IV-5","ageType":"AgeAtDiagnosis","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":14,"allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e33ee5c8-4e79-445b-b3d7-24fab1154615"},"detectionMethod":"SNP genotyping using Affymetrix Human Mapping","firstTestingMethod":"Other","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001249","obo:HP_0001388","obo:HP_0011095","obo:HP_0000486"],"previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"Molecular testing for fragile X syndrome, G-banded karyotype, and FISH analysis for subtelomeric rearrangements also gave normal results.
