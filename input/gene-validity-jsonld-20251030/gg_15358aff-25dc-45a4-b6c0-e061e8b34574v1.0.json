Three nonsense variants that have been reported in 3 probands in 3 publications are included in this curation (PMIDs: 22231303, 27742395, 28903942). One variant segregated with disease in affected family members. Individuals affected with the condition present in infancy with recurrent infections, bloody diarrhea, thrombocytopenia with normal platelet volume, and inflammatory diseases such as eczema and pneumonitis. They have T cell lymphopenia affecting CD8+ lymphocytes most severely. T cell proliferation and chemotaxis are defective, and natural killer cell function is impaired. The clinical impact to heterozygous carriers is unknown. \n\nThis gene-disease association is supported by protein interaction, functional and rescue assays, as well as an animal model (PMIDs: 9405671, 17141616, 22231303, 28903942, 11869681, 17086554). The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss of function. One normal function of WIP is to bind to WASP, stabilizing the protein and preventing its degradation (PMID: 9405671, 17141616, 22231303). In the absence of WIP, WASP expression is reduced or absent despite normal levels of mRNA (PMID: 17141616, 22231303). Introduction of wild type WIPF1 corrects this defect (PMID: 22231303). WAS has been previously established as definitively associated with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, a combined immunodeficiency with thrombocytopenia. WIPF1 knockout mice recapitulate the patient phenotype with severe lymphopenia, splenomegaly, and inflammatory diseases including ulcerative colitis and interstitial pneumonitis (PMID: 11869681, 17086554).\n\nIn summary, WIPF1 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive WIPF1-related combined immunodeficiency with thrombocytopenia. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time This classification was approved by the ClinGen SCID/CID GCEP on the meeting date March 16, 2023 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/15358aff-25dc-45a4-b6c0-e061e8b34574","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/93bc67d5-b9f8-4eab-8f8a-cdc10595be30","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/93bc67d5-b9f8-4eab-8f8a-cdc10595be30_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10081","date":"2023-04-10T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/93bc67d5-b9f8-4eab-8f8a-cdc10595be30_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10081","date":"2023-04-10T16:23:30.852Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/93bc67d5-b9f8-4eab-8f8a-cdc10595be30_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/92fe4339-8b87-464a-9218-5126b919acb6_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/18ff5646-7c37-4a67-9cf2-2a1a3dd7fcdf","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"c.1301C>G (p.Ser434Ter) is absent in gnomAD and predicted to undergo NMD.
