{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/17cfeb10-30fa-4cf0-bb1e-2d4bad4828fdv1.1","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"There have been two studies to date that have identified patients with features consistent with Costello syndrome (CS) and de novo or inherited variants in MAP2K1 (Gripp et al., 2007; Nava et al., 2007). However, none of the patients possessed features to definitively differentiate their diagnosis from other RASopathies as CS, and both studies concluded that the cases should not be diagnosed with CS. Variable expressivity, age of ascertainment, and outdated clinical assessments of affected individuals may complicate the clinical diagnosis of CS versus severe forms of cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome (CFC). Therefore, the evidence for this association is Disputed. Furthermore, the HRAS gene is believed to be the only gene associated with CS (Aoki et al., 2005; Estep, Tidyman, Teitell, Cotter, & Rauen, 2006; Gripp et al., 2006; Kerr et al., 2006; Zampino et al., 2007). Of note, MAP2K1 is classified as Definitive in association with CFC and as Limited in association with Noonan syndrome (NS) and NS with multiple lentigines. The ClinGen RASopathy Expert Panel found no evidence associating MAP2K1 with NS-like disorder with loose anagen hair. This curation was approved by the ClinGen RASopathy Gene Curation Expert Panel on 7/24/18 (SOP Version 5).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/17cfeb10-30fa-4cf0-bb1e-2d4bad4828fd","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8d28301c-df25-4c10-9edb-34be26f2838d","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"NoKnownDiseaseRelationship","changes":{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8d28301c-df25-4c10-9edb-34be26f2838d_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10021","date":"2021-03-10T15:29:27.625Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8d28301c-df25-4c10-9edb-34be26f2838d_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10021","date":"2018-07-24T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"No scorable cases, but claim has been made.","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8d28301c-df25-4c10-9edb-34be26f2838d_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8d28301c-df25-4c10-9edb-34be26f2838d_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0}],"evidenceStrength":"Disputed","sequence":2327,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria5","strengthScore":0,"subject":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/kC79f_l8Mcg","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0009026","gene":"hgnc:6840","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"1.1","websiteLegacyID":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/assertion_8d28301c-df25-4c10-9edb-34be26f2838d-","@context":{"@vocab":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"},"curationReasons":{"@type":"@vocab","@container":"@set"},"GCISnapshot":{"@type":"@id"},"dc:isVersionOf":{"@type":"@id"},"websiteLegacyID":{"@type":"@id"}}}
