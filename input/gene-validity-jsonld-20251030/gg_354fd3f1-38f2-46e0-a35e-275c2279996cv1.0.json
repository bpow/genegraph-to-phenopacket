Autosomal recessive cone-rod dystrophies are a group of inherited retinal disorders involving primary loss of cone photoreceptors with subsequent loss of rods. Clinical symptoms include severely reduced visual acuity, impaired color vision, photophobia, atrophy in the macular region, and reduced cone responses observed on electroretinography. The disease entity curated was RAB28-related retinopathy which encompasses the phenotypes associated with this gene.\n\nTen variants in RAB28 (missense, splicing, nonsense) from ten probands with cone-rod dystrophy have been reported and are included in this curation (Roosing et al, 2013, PMID  23746546; Riveiro-Álvarez et al, 2015, PMID 25356532; Lee et al, 2017, PMID 28388261; Iarossi et al, 2020, PMID  33396523; Jespersgaard et al, 2020, PMID  32084271). The maximum points for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss of function. \n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence. RAB28 is a member of the RAB subfamily of the RAS oncogene family of Ras-related small GTPases and has been reported to have a role in intraflaggelar transport and extracellular vesicle formation in C.elegans ciliated neurons, where it is targeted to the periciliary membrane by the BBSome (Jensen et al, 2016, PMID 27930654; Akella et al, 2020). Features reported in a Rab28 null mouse (Ying et al, 2018, PMID 30228185) and zebrafish model (Carter et al, 2020, PMID 32258030), including defective cone outer segment phagocytosis, support the relationship between RAB28 and cone-rod dystrophy.\n\nIn summary, RAB28 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive RAB28-related retinopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/354fd3f1-38f2-46e0-a35e-275c2279996c","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e8e3c7bd-3ee5-404d-98b0-75af6ec257d1","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e8e3c7bd-3ee5-404d-98b0-75af6ec257d1_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10072","date":"2021-11-04T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e8e3c7bd-3ee5-404d-98b0-75af6ec257d1_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10072","date":"2022-03-02T22:07:31.144Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e8e3c7bd-3ee5-404d-98b0-75af6ec257d1_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9e9d5bab-2763-4136-8c00-488bf8ac1964_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a20e882e-4adf-409a-94a7-02e1d8f651c9","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The scored is reduced because the patient is homozygous.

Immunolabeling studies revealed rapid loss of cones over time in Rab28 knock our mice (from 1 month to 13 months of age. Accordingly, the photopic b-wave amplitude as did the scotopic b-wave amplitude, although more slowly. Outer nuclear layer thickness in the central retina also reduced over time. In addition to recapitulation of these features, the molecular mechanism (loss of function) is the same in humans and the mouse model.\nAdditional findings reported in the mouse were mislocalization of cone outer segments proteins while localization of rod outer segment proteins was normal; elongated COS with enlarged, balloon-like tips while ROS appeared normal; reduced levels of prenylated proteins in COS but not ROS; a 5-fold reduction in cone phagosome while rod phagosome density was comparable to wild type; accumulation of material in cones (microvilli-wrapped structures filled with distorted membrane stacks or vacuolar membranes) at the COS-RPE interface compared to controls.

Defects in this process can cause photoreceptor dysfunction. In this study, the authors built upon a previous report (PMID 27930654). By conducting experiments in series of C. elegans mutants, they deduced a ciliary trafficking pathway in amphid and phasmid neurons in which activated (GTP-bound) RAB-28 is targeted to the pericilliary membrane (PCM) by the BBSome, and to a lesser extent ARL-6. PDL-1 (prenyl-binding protein phosphodiesterase 6 subunit delta, PDE6D) is required for loading RAB-28 onto IFT trains, a step inhibited by ARL-6 (summarized in Figure 1 schematic). They found that Rab28 and the BBSome are key in vivo regulators of extracellular vesicle (EV) production at the periciliary membrane. They noted accumulation of EV cargo markers in the ciliary region of rab-28 and BBSome gene mutants which suggested defects in ciliary EV biogenesis and shedding into the lumens of sensory organs. The authors propose that the EV shedding defects in C. elegans rab-28 and bbs-8 gene mutants, and the reduced disc shedding and/or phagocytosis previously reported in Rab28 knockout mice (see entry for Ying et al, 2018), may involve a shared Rab28 mechanism. However, they also note that the precise nature of this mechanism is not known.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32101165","rdfs:label":"Rab28 function in C. elegans neurons","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f88dd069-5d73-4e8b-a64b-6bbc53b68e35","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Also see the entry for Akella et al, 2020, PMID 32101165, which provides results of follow up studies on the role of Rab28 in C. elegans ciliated neurons.","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ca5c148e-29b2-4312-bbd1-ae88a230aeac","type":"Finding","dc:description":"The authors identify Rab28 as a ciliary protein in C. elegans, with exclusive expression in ciliated neurons. They show that GFP-labeled RAB-28 undergoes continuous, bidirectional, intraflagellar transport (IFT)-like movement along ciliary axonemes at IF-associated velocities. They reported that binding of GTP to RAB-28 targets RAB-28 to the periciliary membrane and facilitates its association with IFT trains. Overexpression of either GTP or GDP-preferring RAB-28 (i.e. T49N and Q95L respectively) induced functional and ultrastructural defects in the cilia and sensory organs of the nematode C. elegans suggesting that similar ciliary defects in human patients with deleterious variants in RAB28 could be involved in retinal dystrophy. \nCiliary transport is important in photoreceptors, in order to transport proteins to the outer segments. Deleterious variants in many other ciliary genes have been reported to result in retinal degeneration (see PMID 28289063 for review), supporting a similar mechanism for RAB28 in cone-rod dystrophy.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27930654","rdfs:label":"RAB28 in intraflaggelar transport","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/45c40132-fb8b-4ef9-ab54-46ec5dce224f","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"This study shows that RAB28 is widely expressed.
