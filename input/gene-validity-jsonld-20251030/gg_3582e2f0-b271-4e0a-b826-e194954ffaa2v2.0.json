The paper reported the same missense variant (Arg690Cys) previously associated with dilated hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (Taylor et al 2005, PMID 16247757), but was later disputed based on high frequency in the gnomAD database, which is consistent with a benign variation. The second variant  reported (Vadrot et al. 2023 PMID 36672271) is a frameshift mutation (Gly395Glufs*11) found in 1 male proband.  The pathogenicity of this variant was supported by limited functional studies in a cell culture model system that showed reduced protein level and expression, with decrease in cell proliferation and mislocalized truncated protein fragments in the cytoplasm, however the mechanism of disease phenotype remains unclear.  The mechanism for disease is unknown. This gene-disease relationship is not supported by other experimental studies.  In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. The relationship between TMPO and autosomal dominant hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was originally evaluated by the ClinGen Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Gene Curation Expert Panel (GCEP) in August 2018 and found to have a no known disease relationship classification. It was re-evaluated in April 2023 by the Hereditary Cardiovascular Disease GCEP. As a result of this recuration, the classification has changed to limited.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3582e2f0-b271-4e0a-b826-e194954ffaa2","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a1e1bb21-c617-4aac-b9d8-1c2054d76c55","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","changes":[{"id":"cg:expertPanelChange"},{"id":"cg:sopChange"},{"id":"cg:newEvidence"},{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"},{"id":"cg:classificationChange"},{"id":"cg:summaryChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a1e1bb21-c617-4aac-b9d8-1c2054d76c55_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10104","date":"2024-07-17T15:28:19.855Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a1e1bb21-c617-4aac-b9d8-1c2054d76c55_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10104","date":"2023-04-27T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["RecurationTiming"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a1e1bb21-c617-4aac-b9d8-1c2054d76c55_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ced246e1-a9fe-4188-bf85-2e90fcf24e0f","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ced246e1-a9fe-4188-bf85-2e90fcf24e0f_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36672271","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0d77f435-e7e6-4aa3-98ec-78d63a1b580c","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001032283.3(TMPO):c.565+1603del","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA6732377"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Heterozygous"}},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ced246e1-a9fe-4188-bf85-2e90fcf24e0f_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"Functional evidence presented in paper shows truncation in cell lines, but unclear association with mechanism of disease phenotype. \n\nConclusion: Analyses performed in dermal fibroblasts from patient 1 and in transfected cell lines reveal the effect of the frameshift variant g.98927219del_c.1184del_p.(Gly395Glufs*11) to decrease the steady state level of both LAP2α mRNA and protein.
