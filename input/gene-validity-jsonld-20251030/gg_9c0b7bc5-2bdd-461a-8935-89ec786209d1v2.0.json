At least 115 unique variants (including many missense and nonsense, several splicing, and some frameshift, etc.) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data.\nVariants in this gene have been reported in at least 14 probands in 4 publications (PMIDs: 8782815, 9529363, 9154114, 9674916). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 18 additional family members. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached.\nThis gene-disease relationship is supported by the biochemical function of HGD, its expression in the liver, and a mouse model which displays high levels of urinary homogentisic acid, as observed in humans (PMIDs: 13271328, 8782815, 8188247). HGD functions in phenylalanine and tyrosine metabolism to convert homogentisate to maleylacetoacetate; in the absence of HGD activity accumulation of homogentisate results in alkaptonuria.\nIn summary, HGD is definitively associated with autosomal recessive inheritance of alkaptonuria. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9c0b7bc5-2bdd-461a-8935-89ec786209d1","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5186836d-d9c6-4829-a0c9-59548460d6f2","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":[{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"},{"id":"cg:sopChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5186836d-d9c6-4829-a0c9-59548460d6f2_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10011","date":"2020-06-29T17:41:25.541Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5186836d-d9c6-4829-a0c9-59548460d6f2_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10011","date":"2020-09-16T19:23:17.640Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5186836d-d9c6-4829-a0c9-59548460d6f2_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5186836d-d9c6-4829-a0c9-59548460d6f2_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/52dabeae-d781-42da-92db-142760d0df11","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The majority of dietary tyrosine is metabolised in the liver via HGA to malate and acetoacetate.
