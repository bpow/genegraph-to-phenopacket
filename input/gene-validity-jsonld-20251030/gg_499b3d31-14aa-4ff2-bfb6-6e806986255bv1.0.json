Variants in DSC2 were first reported in humans with this disease as early as 2006 (Syrris et al., PMID: 17033975). At least 13 variants (e.g. missense, nonsense, frameshift) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level\ndata and experimental data. Summary of Case Level Data: 8.5 points. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 13 probands in 6 publications (PMIDs: 17963498,  21062920, 23863954, 17186466, 18957847, 17033975). This gene-disease relationship is supported by animal models, expression studies, and protein interactions. In summary, DSC2 is definitively associated with ARVD (AD) and ARVD with mild palmoplantar keratoderma with or without woolly hair (AR). This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.  This classification was approved by the ClinGen Arrythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy Gene Curation Expert Panel on September 14, 2018 (SOP Version 6).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/499b3d31-14aa-4ff2-bfb6-6e806986255b","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/74238dee-a847-4f27-9d30-3050c7bf9bf2","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/74238dee-a847-4f27-9d30-3050c7bf9bf2_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10003","date":"2020-09-16T19:22:58.119Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/74238dee-a847-4f27-9d30-3050c7bf9bf2_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10003","date":"2018-09-14T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10018","role":"SecondaryContributor"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/74238dee-a847-4f27-9d30-3050c7bf9bf2_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/74238dee-a847-4f27-9d30-3050c7bf9bf2_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5139cb4a-9cb0-4118-a7c4-9b2ed9ffc720","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Mouse model did not fully recapitulate the disease.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3c2ac3a6-a2b0-4dfc-bc33-b2875bc49e5d","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Mice developed severe mycocardial necrosis and fibrosis.
