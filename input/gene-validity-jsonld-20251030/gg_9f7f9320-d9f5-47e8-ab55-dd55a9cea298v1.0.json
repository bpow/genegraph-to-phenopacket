At least 10 unique variants (missense, nonsense, frameshift and large deletions) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level and experimental data.\n\nSummary of Case Level Data: \nVariants in this gene have been reported in at least 12 probands in 4 publications (11586359, 15877281, 23918746, 27572252), including a heterozygous de novo 14kb deletion of FOXP2 exons 12-17 (Reuter et al., 2016; 27572252) that would add an additional 2 points so the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached.\n\nThis gene-disease association is supported by animal models, expression studies and in vitro functional assays.\n\nIn summary, FOXP2 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant specific language disorder. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.\n\nThis classification was approved by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism Working Group on 05/21/2019\n(SOP Version 6)","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9f7f9320-d9f5-47e8-ab55-dd55a9cea298","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b13348d1-1248-4507-aa29-60559e6b410e","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b13348d1-1248-4507-aa29-60559e6b410e_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b13348d1-1248-4507-aa29-60559e6b410e_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2019-05-21T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b13348d1-1248-4507-aa29-60559e6b410e_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b13348d1-1248-4507-aa29-60559e6b410e_ad_dn_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/549307cd-eb84-4e26-a006-aebd3fd4535a_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Downgraded as only FOXP2 was targeted and there is a positive family history of speech/language difficulties.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ded5fe14-21f9-4e2b-8e2e-9280fb83bb9a","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23918746","rdfs:label":"A-II-1","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":8,"detectionMethod":"FOXP2 was amplified using gene-specific primers designed to the reference human transcript (Ensembl ID: ENSG00000128573; http://www.ensembl.org).
