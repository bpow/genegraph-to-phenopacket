These variants are common (allele frequency >5% in multiple populations), and therefore were not scored as a part of this curation. There have been other case-control studies performed, all of which do not show a significant difference in the frequency of the previously mentioned *TOPBP1* variants (PMID:30084161) or other rare variants (PMID:29650961) between PAH patients and controls. Functionally, expression of *TOPBP1* was shown to be reduced in PAH patient cells. Furthermore, siRNA knockdown of *TOPB1* in control cells resulted in altered tube formation in PMVECs (pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells) in vitro. Subsequently, overexpression of *TOPBP1* rescued the tube malformations in PAH patient PMVECs (PMID:24702692). \n\nIn summary, due to. the. lack. of genetic. evidence, *TOPBP1* has no known disease relationship with autosomal dominant PAH. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Pulmonary Hypertension GCEP on the meeting date 8/30/22 (SOP Version 9).\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0d292e89-a552-4513-b503-ca928f42ac46","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8dfd5fc5-a4cb-4beb-8486-eae7675d08af","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"NoKnownDiseaseRelationship","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8dfd5fc5-a4cb-4beb-8486-eae7675d08af_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10071","date":"2022-11-22T14:53:06.803Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8dfd5fc5-a4cb-4beb-8486-eae7675d08af_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10071","date":"2022-11-22T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8dfd5fc5-a4cb-4beb-8486-eae7675d08af_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8dfd5fc5-a4cb-4beb-8486-eae7675d08af_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1ce486ac-d904-48d3-8828-dfea4f3161e1","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e53f911f-2a25-4c32-897f-639d16cc39ae","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Restoration of TOPBP1 resulted in improved tube formation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24702692","rdfs:label":"tube formation assay"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8dfd5fc5-a4cb-4beb-8486-eae7675d08af_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/114ff50e-0685-4aee-9daf-a2de6e3e9971","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/186b6175-ce83-476a-b51e-fddf1e47abde","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Gene expression is significantly lower in patient lung tissue as compared to healthy donors (p<0.0001).","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24702692","rdfs:label":"reduced expression of TOPBP1 in PAH tissues/cells","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionB"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8dfd5fc5-a4cb-4beb-8486-eae7675d08af_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0}],"evidenceStrength":"NoKnownDiseaseRelationship","sequence":5361,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria9","strengthScore":1,"subject":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/njra2w6EGpw","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0015924","gene":"hgnc:17008","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"1.0","websiteLegacyID":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/assertion_8dfd5fc5-a4cb-4beb-8486-eae7675d08af-","@context":{"@vocab":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"},"curationReasons":{"@type":"@vocab","@container":"@set"},"GCISnapshot":{"@type":"@id"},"dc:isVersionOf":{"@type":"@id"},"websiteLegacyID":{"@type":"@id"}}}
