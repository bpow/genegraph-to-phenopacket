At least 26 unique variants (e.g. missense, in-frame indel, nonsense, frameshift, etc) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 17 probands in 4 publications (PMIDs: 23746549, 26754003, 28973083, 27528495). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 5 additional family members. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence and experimental evidence has been reached. This gene-disease association is supported by its exclusive expression in skeletal muscle which is altered in patients, its biochemical function in stabilization of LMOD3 and protein interaction with NEB, as well as zebrafish and mouse models which recapitulate disruption of muscle structures and loss of movement, and a rescue of the mouse model with muscle-specific wild type KLHL40. In summary, KLHL40 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive nemaline myopathy 8. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/eb0eaf5d-1894-4a9f-b7cb-386a1c99287b","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/dd1008a8-dd54-43d0-962c-82453975dc3a","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/dd1008a8-dd54-43d0-962c-82453975dc3a_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10031","date":"2019-11-05T13:46:03.480Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/dd1008a8-dd54-43d0-962c-82453975dc3a_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10031","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/dd1008a8-dd54-43d0-962c-82453975dc3a_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/63dfac00-4a03-4f68-a1cf-cd6ac1b7701e_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Both substitutions were mapped to the crystal structures of the kelch domain and are involved in intramolecular interactions, and thus the substitutions would most likely destabilize the hydrophobic cores of the BTB-BACK domain (p.Leu86Pro) or the hydrogen bonds between the main chain and side chain (p.Asp34His).
