The first report of GRIP1 in association with Fraser syndrome 3 was in Vogel, et.al 2012 (PMID:22510445), which reported in 2 independent fetuses with homozygous loss of function GRIP1 variants and phenotypes consistent with Fraser syndrome.  Biallelic or homozygous loss of function (nonsense, frameshift, canonical splice, and deletion) variants in GRIP1 have since been reported in multiple additional affected individuals in the literature with Fraser Syndrome 3 (PMIDs:24357607, 33709629).  The mechanism for GRIP1 in association with Fraser Syndrome 3 is loss of function and it is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern.  GRIP1 knockout mouse models have variable background dependent phenotypes including embryonic lethality with severe bullous disorder, haemorrhagic bullae, limb malformations including syndactyly and polydactyly, uni- or bilateral cryptophthalmos, and absent kidneys (PMIDs:11983858, 14730302).  GRIP1 localization studies in mouse and in vitro models demonstrate the presence of GRIP1 at the basal cell layer in developing epidermis and co-localization with Fras1 and Frem2 in epithelial cells (PMID:11983858, 14730302).  Given the genetic and functional evidence, GRIP1 is classified as Definitive for Fraser Syndrome 3.\nOf note, missense variants in GRIP1 have also been implicated in Congential Anomalies of the Kidney and Urinary Tract (CAKUT) (PMID:24700879, 26489027, 26539891, 33226606), however curation of GRIP1 for CAKUT and associated phenotypes is out of the scope of the Prenatal Gene Curation Expert Panel.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/289da49d-0508-47f4-9d49-679f82dbf126","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2f48ad44-97c0-41e8-b50e-307eac8c310a","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2f48ad44-97c0-41e8-b50e-307eac8c310a_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10106","date":"2023-05-09T22:10:24.391Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2f48ad44-97c0-41e8-b50e-307eac8c310a_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10106","date":"2023-03-14T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"First report of GRIP1 in association with Fraser syndrome 3 was in Vogel, et.al. 2012 (PMID:22510445), so the association of GRIP1 with Fraser syndrome 3 has been replicated over time.","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2f48ad44-97c0-41e8-b50e-307eac8c310a_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2f48ad44-97c0-41e8-b50e-307eac8c310a_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e2cc9a55-e0bb-4170-8ba7-a7229e2b515d","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"No change in default score given overlap with human phenotypes and confirmation of null variant with southern and western blots","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f68fc03f-650d-46cb-ab1e-ef6ae473843e","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Mice in mixed 129XC57 background were embryonic lethal with blebbing and serous bullae described in other Grip1 KO models.
