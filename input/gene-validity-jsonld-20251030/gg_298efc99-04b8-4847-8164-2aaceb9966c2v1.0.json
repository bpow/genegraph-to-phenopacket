The NDUFV1 gene encodes the NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) flavoprotein 1, a core subunit of mitochondrial complex I. Defects of this protein lead to complex I deficiency.\n\nThe NDUFV1 gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Leigh syndrome spectrum in 2001 (PMID: 11349233). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data.\n\nThis curation included nine unique variants identified in nine cases from seven publications (PMIDs: 23266820, 29976978, 11349233, 27344648, 30090137, 23334465, 21696386). No segregation data were available. Loss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease association is also supported by known protein interactions, animal models, and functional alterations in patient cells (PMIDs: 11349233, 30972103, 19672299, 27509854). \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support this gene-disease relationship, including that more than three years have elapsed from the first proposal of the association. This classification was approved by the NICHD U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel November 20, 2019 (SOP Version 7).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/298efc99-04b8-4847-8164-2aaceb9966c2","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1b96e332-59c4-4636-8bdf-bf893ea059f1","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1b96e332-59c4-4636-8bdf-bf893ea059f1_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1b96e332-59c4-4636-8bdf-bf893ea059f1_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2019-11-26T16:34:30.120Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1b96e332-59c4-4636-8bdf-bf893ea059f1_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1b96e332-59c4-4636-8bdf-bf893ea059f1_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/97046068-dd36-432c-ab1b-381aaee0536e","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Partial Ndufv1 knockdown model using RNAi, showed reduced complex I activity compared to WT lines and reduced survival.

She was started on co-enzyme Q10, alpha-lipoic acid, riboflavin, thiamine, and creatine monohydrate for likely mitochondrial disease, as well as carnitine supplementation.

Her continued developmental progression was interrupted by acute decompensation secondary to minor falls and head trauma, with incomplete recovery. Investigations revealed an elevated blood lactate concentration (4 mmol/L), low total and free carnitine, and an MRI demonstrated bilateral, confluent signal abnormalities in periventricular, juxtacortical and callosal white matter with a lactate peak in affected areas on spectroscopy that was basal ganglia sparing.

Started on co-enzyme Q10, creatine monohydrate, riboflavin,thiamine, vitamin E, and vitamin C.  Mildly elevated serum lactate concentration (3.1 mmol/L, NRb2.2 mmol/L).

A repeat MRI at 4 years showed significant improvement in the T2 hyperintense signal abnormalities and resolution of the lactate peak on spectroscopy, but an increase in cystic changes was noted.
