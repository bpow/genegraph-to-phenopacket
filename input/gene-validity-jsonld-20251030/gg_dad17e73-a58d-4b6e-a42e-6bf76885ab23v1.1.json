However, all of the individuals identified were also described to have loose anagen hair (LAH); therefore, these cases should all be considered SHOC2-Noonan syndrome-like disorder with LAH (NS/LAH) patients. The p.Ser2Gly variant has been a recurrently identified variant in cases with NS/LAH, and no other variants have been identified in these patients (Cordeddu et al., 2009; Ekvall et al., 2011; Komatsuzaki et al., 2010). In summary, this association is Disputed. Of note, SHOC2 is classified as Definitive in association with NS/LAH and as Disputed in association with NS and Costello syndrome. The ClinGen RASopathy Expert Panel found no evidence associating SHOC2 with NS with multiple lentigines. This curation was approved by the ClinGen RASopathy Gene Curation Expert Panel on 6/1/18 (SOP Version 5).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/dad17e73-a58d-4b6e-a42e-6bf76885ab23","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fd8e5069-4023-4763-9b41-03350b03ee7f","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"NoKnownDiseaseRelationship","changes":{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fd8e5069-4023-4763-9b41-03350b03ee7f_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10021","date":"2018-06-01T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fd8e5069-4023-4763-9b41-03350b03ee7f_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10021","date":"2021-03-10T14:52:39.346Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"All the cases that have presented with CFC like features had LAH or have not had it ruled out, and possess the p.Ser2Gly variant.
