Variants in DLD were first reported in humans with this disease as early as 1993 (Liu et al., PMID: 8506365). At least 15 variants (missense, in-frame indel, nonsense, frameshift) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data. Summary of Case Level Data: 12 points. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 11 probands in 10 publications.\nVariants in this gene segregated with disease in 3 additional family members. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence and/or\nexperimental evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. This gene-disease association is supported by in vitro functional assays and an animal model. In summary, DLD is definitively associated with autosomal recessive pyruvate dehydrogenase E3 deficiency. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. The classification was approved by the ClinGen Aminoacidopathy Gene Curation Expert Panel on March 8th, 2019.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9c847c7e-0873-47d7-9e41-59e90487f69a","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a9dfbbc2-cede-491e-9db0-fc5719fbc729","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a9dfbbc2-cede-491e-9db0-fc5719fbc729_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10011","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a9dfbbc2-cede-491e-9db0-fc5719fbc729_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10011","date":"2019-03-08T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a9dfbbc2-cede-491e-9db0-fc5719fbc729_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/708d319b-dbda-443b-9fbb-232fb3c0cb33_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f4206829-543d-4168-abe8-415078b75c53","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8968745","rdfs:label":"Hong 1996 Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDeath","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":28,"detectionMethod":"Total RNA from fibroblasts used to synthesize E3 cDNA using RT-PCR.
