The condition is primarily characterized by adenomatous polyposis of colon (~10-50), colorectal cancer, and breast cancer. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found  NTHL1-deficiency tumor predisposition syndrome (MONDO:0100502) is the only one disease entity associated with this gene. About 30 individuals carrying biallelic loss-of-function variants, most commonly NM_002528.7(NTHL1):c.244C>T (p.Gln82Ter) (formerly referred to as p.Gln90Ter) in line with its relatively high minor allele frequency (~0.1%) in the population databases, have been reported to date and 5 of them along with their affected siblings are included in this curation (PMIDs: 25938944, 30753826, 27720914, 26559593). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity has been demonstrated to be loss-of-function resulting in deficient NTHL1 activity (PMID: 25938944). A specific mutational signature due to a high percentage of somatic C>T transitions (COSMIS Signature 30) in cancer driver genes such as *KRAS, APC, TP53, PIK3CA* has been identified on tested tumor samples, and the preliminary data also suggest other primary tumors, i.e. urothelial carcinoma of the bladder, might also be linked to *NTHL1* deficiency per mutational profiling of such tumors (PMID: 30753826). This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence (3.85 points from human cell models, in vitro functional assays, animal models, etc.) (PMIDs: 8990169, 19346169, 30552997, 28912133). Particularly, human colonic stem cells-derived organoids devoid of NTHL1 activity phenocopied the somatic mutational signature detected in tumoral samples of individuals carrying biallelic loss-of-function *NTHL1* variants. In summary, *NTHL1* is definitively associated with autosomal recessive NTHL1-deficiency tumor predisposition syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.

However, both double knock-out and single gene knock-out (NTHL1-/-) mice developed these tumors in their second year of life. Interestingly, KRAS codon12 mutation detected in the lung and hepatic tumor samples was GGT > GAT transition, in contrast to a transversion found in MUTYH and OGG1 tumor samples. The accumulated substance (FAP was also different than that was found in OGG1-/- mice (8-OH-Gua).","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c8a55713-42ad-4ab8-beb9-de1062eb29a4","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Only in terms of tumoral formation.
