For this curation, variants in *ADAM17* have been reported in individuals with the following phenotypes: Tetralogy of Fallot and atrioventricular septal defect. Of note, this gene has also been implicated in neonatal inflammatory skin and bowel disease (OMIM:614328). This will be assessed separately. At least six unique missense variants have been reported in humans with congenital heart disease; however, three of them were too frequent to cause disease. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least five probands in two publications (PMIDs: 27058611, 30610007). This gene-disease relationship is supported by animal models and expression studies (PMIDs: 9812885, 12773386, 14499647, 15936750, 33957124). In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Congenital Heart Disease GCEP on the meeting date 08/14/2023 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/27e286a7-e2de-481c-8e5e-267467c0bfe4","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8ad3a100-7a22-4065-aaa2-87c64a843486","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8ad3a100-7a22-4065-aaa2-87c64a843486_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10130","date":"2023-09-14T14:47:21.885Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8ad3a100-7a22-4065-aaa2-87c64a843486_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10130","date":"2023-08-14T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8ad3a100-7a22-4065-aaa2-87c64a843486_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8ad3a100-7a22-4065-aaa2-87c64a843486_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d517ea25-38e2-4c83-8698-820f67a1fa87","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The heterozygous animals did not display a phenotype, which is inconsistent with the AD disease state in humans, so this model organism is being downgraded.
