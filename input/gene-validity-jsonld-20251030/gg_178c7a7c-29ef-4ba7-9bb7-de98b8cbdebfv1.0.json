{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/178c7a7c-29ef-4ba7-9bb7-de98b8cbdebfv1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"The PPP1R12A gene is located on chromosome 12 at 12q21.2-q21.31 and encodes the protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 12A protein. This protein forms part of myosin phosphatase, an enzyme that plays an important regulatory role in cell morphology and motility. PPP1R12A was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant genitourinary and/or brain malformation syndrome in 2020 (Hughes et al., 2020 PMID 31883643). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Twelve unique variants, all of which are predicted to result in protein truncation and nonsense mediated decay, have been reported in humans (Hughes et al., 2020 PMID 31883643). In the majority of cases, the variants were shown to have occurred de novo though parents weren’t available in a few cases. The mechanism for disease is predicted to be haploinsufficiency. This gene-disease relationship is supported by expression in the brain and urogenital system during embryonic development (Hughes et al., 2020 PMID 31883642) and data from C. elegans (Wissman et al., 1999 PMID 10208747), Drosophila (Tan et al., 2003 PMID 12505998), and zebrafish models (Weiser et al., 2009 PMID 19515695). In summary, there is strong evidence to support the relationship between PPP1R12A and autosomal dominant genitourinary and/or brain malformation syndrome. Additional reports in humans published at least three years from the first proposal of the association are needed to reach a definitive classification. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Syndromic Disorders Gene Curation Expert Panel on the meeting date 16Oct2020 (SOP Version 7).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/178c7a7c-29ef-4ba7-9bb7-de98b8cbdebf","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/93fa5165-a907-4ca8-b0d3-bb174bf3fca9","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Strong","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/93fa5165-a907-4ca8-b0d3-bb174bf3fca9_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10060","date":"2021-07-27T14:54:58.008Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/93fa5165-a907-4ca8-b0d3-bb174bf3fca9_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10060","date":"2021-07-27T14:55:06.527Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/93fa5165-a907-4ca8-b0d3-bb174bf3fca9_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/93fa5165-a907-4ca8-b0d3-bb174bf3fca9_ad_dn_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ad796ab0-102d-4fae-86c6-93ac6b6c4286_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"de novo predicted null (NMD expected) with confirmed parentage","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/69c4f31d-e71c-402a-90d8-3e307cc27139","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31883643","rdfs:label":"individual 1","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":15,"detectionMethod":"trio WES","firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"Phenotypic sex female, genotypic sex 46,XX.

Stopping heat treatment 1 to 2 days before eclosion lead to incomplete rescue of DMYPT03802, with adults developing wing and leg defects. Lethal phase analysis showed that 44% of homozygous DMYPT03802 animals die during embryogenesis, while the remaining 56% die during early first larval instar (485 total embryos counted). More than 80% of the dead mutant embryos displayed a failure of dorsal closure with a characteristic dorsal hole in their cuticles (Fig. 2B,C).\n\nThe authors note that DMYPT is maternally contributed and suggest that the maternal supply of DMYPT is likely the reason that the dorsal closure phenotype is variable among embryos and is influenced by genetic background.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12505998","rdfs:label":"Tan 2003 Drosophila model","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1923468b-c149-43e4-a43c-abab0cd77f83","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"no phenotype in het KO mice; homozygous KO is embryonic lethal with no follow-on experiments in embryos","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Inconclusive","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/eff1a8a4-22c7-428d-83c3-e0fc9eadbd44","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Generated MYPT1-deficient mice by gene targeting.

Used the Cre-loxP system to establish Mypt1-floxed mice, with the promoter region and exon 1 of Mypt1 flanked by 2 loxP sites. These mice were crossed with SMA-Cre transgenic mice to generate mice with smooth muscle-specific deletion of MYPT1 (Mypt1(SMKO) mice). The phenotype was assessed by histologic, biochemical, molecular, and physiologic analyses. Young adult Mypt1(SMKO) mice had normal intestinal motility in vivo, with no histologic abnormalities. On stimulation with KCl or acetylcholine, intestinal smooth muscles isolated from Mypt1(SMKO) mice produced robust and increased sustained force due to increased phosphorylation of the myosin regulatory light chain compared with muscle from control mice. Additional analyses of contractile properties showed reduced rates of force development and relaxation, and decreased shortening velocity, compared with muscle from control mice. Permeable smooth muscle fibers from Mypt1(SMKO) mice had increased sensitivity and contraction in response to Ca(2+). Conclude that MYPT1 is not essential for smooth muscle function in mice but regulates the Ca(2+) sensitivity of force development and contributes to intestinal phasic contractile phenotype.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23499953","rdfs:label":"He 2014 smooth muscle specific KO","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":0}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/93fa5165-a907-4ca8-b0d3-bb174bf3fca9_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9ae7992d-5543-42c7-be60-7b537699a852","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"PPP1CB, which encodes one of 3 catalytic subunits of PP1 (PP1C-beta/delta), is associated with AD Noonan-like syndrome with loose anagen hair (Definitive by ClinGen in April 2020).
