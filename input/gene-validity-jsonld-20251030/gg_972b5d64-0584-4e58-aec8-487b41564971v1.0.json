{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/972b5d64-0584-4e58-aec8-487b41564971v1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"*SLX4* encodes a protein that functions as a scaffold element for the assembly of a multiprotein complex containing endonucleases activity required for repair of specific types of DNA lesions and critical for cellular responses to replication fork failure.  Biallelic *SLX4* mutations are associated with Fanconi anemia, complementation group P. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, curations to refute or dispute can be split when needed. We only focus on hereditary breast cancer in this curation. Evidence curated in this gene-disease relationship includes case-control data and experimental data.\n\n**Summary of Case-Control Data: 0 point**\nThis gene-disease relationship has been studied in at least 2 case-control or meta-analysis studies at the aggregate variant level. In 2021, a large case-control study [CARRIERS (PMID: 33471974) with more than 32 thousand cases and controls] did not identify a significant association of aggregate loss of function (LOF) variants in *SLX4* and breast cancer. Another meta-analysis study (PMID: 32488392) with smaller populations also did not show an association of *SLX4* variants with breast cancer. \n\n**Summary of Experimental Data: 0.25 points**\nWhile case control studies did not support the gene-disease association, Hodskinson et al. showed that mice with homozygous *SLX4* knockout developed epithelial cancers, suggesting the role as a tumor suppressor (PMID: 24726326). \n\n**Overall Summary:**\nIn summary, given the lack of significant association in large breast cancer case-control studies to date, there is convincing evidence refuting the association between *SLX4* and autosomal dominant hereditary breast cancer, which significantly outweighs the evidence supporting the association. This gene-disease pair was originally evaluated as limited by the Breast/Ovarian Cancer GCEP on 3/8//2017. This re-curation was approved by the ClinGen Hereditary Diseases GCEP on 6/9/2023 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/972b5d64-0584-4e58-aec8-487b41564971","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4acc26ec-2174-4b21-bb02-965ae3539062","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4acc26ec-2174-4b21-bb02-965ae3539062_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10023","date":"2023-12-21T17:55:14.351Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4acc26ec-2174-4b21-bb02-965ae3539062_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10023","date":"2023-12-21T18:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"Given the lack of significant association in large breast cancer case-control studies to date, there is convincing evidence refuting the association between SLX4 and autosomal dominant hereditary breast cancer, which significantly outweighs the evidence supporting the association.","curationReasons":["RecurationFrameworkChange","RecurationNewEvidence"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4acc26ec-2174-4b21-bb02-965ae3539062_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4acc26ec-2174-4b21-bb02-965ae3539062_cc_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6940c9f7-e0c9-4e72-8e99-e080bd195cbc","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"\"Case and controls were also matched for sex (only females) and for race or ethnic group, other than age.
