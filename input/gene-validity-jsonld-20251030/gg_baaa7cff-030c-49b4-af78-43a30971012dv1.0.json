{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/baaa7cff-030c-49b4-af78-43a30971012dv1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"The PRG4 gene is located on chromosome 1 at 1q31.1 and encodes the proteoglycan 4 protein, which is a lubricating component of synovial fluid and acts as a boundary lubricant at the cartilage surface. It also has a chondroprotective feature and acts by preventing protein deposition from the synovial fluid onto the cartilage surface. PRG4 was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive, camptodactyly-arthropathy-coxa vara-pericarditis syndrome in 1999 (Marcelino et al., 1999 PMID 10545950). This is a rare disorder characterized by early onset camptodactyly, non-inflammatory arthropathy with synovial hyperplasia, and progressive coxa vara deformity. Pericardial or pleural effusions have also been reported in some patients. Camptodactyly is usually the first finding in the majority of patients, followed by swellings of the wrists, knees, and elbows around the age of 4 years. Large joint involvement and age of onset of pain varies among patients. Severe hip and vertebral involvement developed after 20 years of age. At least 7 unique loss of function variants have been reported in literature. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 6 probands from 3 publications (Marcelino et al., 1999 PMID 10545950; Peters et al., 2016 PMID 27224999; Yilmaz et al., 2018 PMID 29397575). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in three families. One clan comprising five families reported 12 affected family members, five of whom were homozygous for the same variant (PMID 29397575). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism for disease is biallelic loss of function. This gene-disease relationship is supported by two independent Prg4 KO mouse modes that recapitulate the human disease (Rhee et al., 2005 PMID 15719068; Coles et al., 2010 PMID 20191580). In summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between PRG4 and autosomal recessive camptodactyly-arthropathy-coxa vara-pericarditis syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Syndromic Disorders Gene Curation Expert Panel on the meeting date April 27th, 2021 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/baaa7cff-030c-49b4-af78-43a30971012d","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3b4be938-664c-421e-922b-dc6ac83e5dec","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3b4be938-664c-421e-922b-dc6ac83e5dec_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10060","date":"2021-07-30T13:07:37.801Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3b4be938-664c-421e-922b-dc6ac83e5dec_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10060","date":"2021-07-30T13:07:45.326Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3b4be938-664c-421e-922b-dc6ac83e5dec_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3b4be938-664c-421e-922b-dc6ac83e5dec_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/eb4f4d18-a74d-4b34-948d-6f9c7f69358b","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/490e8336-4652-4e10-a9ba-55cb23244484","type":"Finding","dc:description":"At 2 months of age, joints of PRG4-/- mice were significantly different from WT and heterozygous mice. Mutant mice exhibited synovial hyperplasia that progressed with age, subintimal fibrosis, proteinaceous deposits on the cartilage surface, irregular cartilage surface, and endochondral growth plates. By 4 months of age, mutant mice showed swelling of the ankle joints, flexion deformity of the hind paws, and developed an abnormal hopping gait. At 9 months of age, the knee joint space in mutant mice was filled by a noninflammatory, hyperplastic synovium, and the articular cartilage surface was barely recognizable. Abnormal calcification was present in tendon sheaths and osteophytes with higher number of proliferating cells in synovium of mutant mice. These findings were further confirmed by ex vivo experiments on cultured synoviocytes of 4-month mutant mice. Prg4 -/- mice recaptulate many of the phenotypes found in patients, including joint swelling, abnormal gait, progressive synovial hyperplasia, abnormal cartilage surface, and eventual joint failure.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15719068","rdfs:label":"PRG4 KO mouse model (exon 6 replaced)","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c48b579b-b286-42e1-9baa-d4576e3e22a8","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ed9fdcf1-5adb-43ec-aed4-44b6a18132c4","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Synovial fluid from patients with CACP show no ability to lower friction in a latex-onglass bearing, which can be effectively lubricated by normal synovial fluid.
