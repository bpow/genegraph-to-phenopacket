Ectopic expression of ROR1 was found to prevent cochlear hair cell loss in guinea pigs with noise-induced hearing loss (PMID:34008309). In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease association. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease association. This gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the Hearing Loss GCEP on 10/04/2018. It was reevaluated on 6/15/2022. As a result of this reevaluation, the classification did not change.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cc301d70-dd2d-4620-85cf-c749878cabb4","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fdee1ffc-d8bd-4188-acb6-5fad8f5902a6","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"NoKnownDiseaseRelationship","changes":[{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},{"id":"cg:newEvidence"},{"id":"cg:sopChange"},{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fdee1ffc-d8bd-4188-acb6-5fad8f5902a6_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2022-06-15T04:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fdee1ffc-d8bd-4188-acb6-5fad8f5902a6_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2024-01-24T16:59:52.758Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease association.","curationReasons":["RecurationNewEvidence"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fdee1ffc-d8bd-4188-acb6-5fad8f5902a6_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fdee1ffc-d8bd-4188-acb6-5fad8f5902a6_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a3cc615e-93ed-4bb2-ba6c-17e95856dc1a","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cabd986a-f95e-40cb-b3ed-9485321d4d63","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Ror1 was detected in mouse spiral ganglia and cochlear epithelium in embryonic day 14.5 mice.
