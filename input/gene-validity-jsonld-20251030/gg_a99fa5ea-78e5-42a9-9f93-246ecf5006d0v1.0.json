{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a99fa5ea-78e5-42a9-9f93-246ecf5006d0v1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"*DNAAF11*, formerly known as Leucine-Rich Repeat-Containing Protein 6 (*LRRC6*), was first described as a primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD)-causing gene in 2012 (Kott et al., PMID: 23122589). Some of the most common patient phenotypes are situs inversus totalis, bronchiectasis, bronchitis, asthenospermia, low nasal nitric oxide levels, otitis media, absent or abnormal inner and outer dynein arms and immotile cilia.\n\nThis curation includes six variants (1 missense, 2 nonsense & 3 frameshift) that have been reported in 5 probands in 4 publications (PMIDs: 23527195, 23122589, 26228299, 31507630). One proband (in PMID: 23527195) had enough genotyped family members to establish segregation evidence, however, the calculated LOD score was not sufficient to contribute to scoring. There were also two instances of upscoring due to the presence of functional evidence. In both cases, the variant DNAAF11 protein was shown to be absent from the proband's cells (PMID: 23122589, PMID: 23527195). Additionally, there was only one occurrence of a proband having two different variants in the compound heterozygous state (PMID: 23122589). The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss of function.\n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by expression studies, biochemical evidence, protein interactions, functional alterations and animal models (PMIDs: 29601588, 23527195, 23891469, 23715323, 27353389, 23122589). First, expression profiling showed high levels of expression of *DNAAF11* in human tissues associated with PCD (fallopian tubes, testis and lungs, PMID:23715323). The stability of DNAAF11 was shown to be increased upon co-expression of ZMYND10 (PMID: 29601588). DNAAF11 was also shown to be involved in assembly or trafficking during ciliary biogenesis, through the observation that *DNAAF11* silencing caused truncated or absent dynein arms in airway epithelial cells (PMID: 23527195), consistent with the axonemal defects observed in affected subjects. DNAAF11 protein also localizes within the basal body and striated rootlet, which is consistent with DNAAF11’s proposed role in ciliary assembly (PMID: 23891469). Other genes encoding ciliary assembly factors such as *DNAAF1*, *DNAAF2* and *DNAAF3* harbor variants that similarly cause PCD with ODA and IDA defects. ZMYND10 in particular has been shown to share the same chaperone function (PMID: 23122589) and to interact with DNAAF11 (PMID: 29916806). and that they serve similar functions in cellular development. ODAD3 performs a similar function in cilia formation (PMID: 24067530) and, like ZMYND10, has a gene-disease relationship with PCD. A mouse model of *Dnaaf11* loss presented phenotypes similar to the ones displayed by the human probands (PMID: 27353389), including reversal of the heart apex, stomach, aortic arch and azygos vein, immotile cilia, immotile sperm, and ODA/IDA defects, as well as hydrocephalus.\n\nIn conclusion, *DNAAF11* is definitively associated with autosomal recessive primary ciliary dyskinesia 19. This classification has been clearly demonstrated and confirmed through both experimental and genetic evidence and upheld through time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Motile Ciliopathy GCEP on June 8th, 2023 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a99fa5ea-78e5-42a9-9f93-246ecf5006d0","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7063ef1e-8ce2-4f35-a765-f08efc2e541a","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7063ef1e-8ce2-4f35-a765-f08efc2e541a_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10102","date":"2023-06-29T20:35:46.431Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7063ef1e-8ce2-4f35-a765-f08efc2e541a_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10102","date":"2023-06-08T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7063ef1e-8ce2-4f35-a765-f08efc2e541a_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7063ef1e-8ce2-4f35-a765-f08efc2e541a_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d31cbe95-4e98-4e7f-88fe-f53ab3d8bc1a","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/14267a52-c766-435e-b89a-b06925620f9a","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Lrrc6 protein was absent in the trachea of Lrrc6−/− mice (Fig. S1E in Supporting Information), suggesting that Lrrc6− is a null allele. Upon intercrosses of Lrrc6+/− mice, Lrrc6−/− embryos were detected at the expected frequency at E8.0. However, Lrrc6−/− mice were found at a lower frequency at birth, suggesting that a significant portion (approximately 60%) of Lrrc6−/− mice die in utero. Mutant newborn mice showed laterality defects (6/6 newborn mice) with variable severities. Thus, some of them (2/6) showed reversal of the heart apex, stomach, aortic arch and azygos vein, whereas others showed less severe defects with abnormal liver lobation (Table S1 in Supporting Information). Surviving mutant mice (6/6 mice) developed hydrocephalus 3 weeks after the birth, and all Lrrc6−/− mice eventually died within 5 weeks of birth.\n\nThese defects, typical of patients with PCD and PCD animals, suggest that ciliary motility may be impaired in the Lrrc6−/− mice. This was indeed the case. Node cilia, which rotate into the clockwise direction in the WT embryos (Movie S1 in Supporting Information), were completely immotile in the Lrrc6−/− mice (Fig. 3A; Movie S2 in Supporting Information). The cilia of trachea epithelial cells and brain ependymal cells, which show planar beating in WT mice (Movie S3 and S5 in Supporting Information), also lost motility in the Lrrc6−/− mice (Fig. 3A; Movie S4 and S6 in Supporting Information). Finally, Lrrc6 was specifically deleted from male germ cells using Nanos3-Cre (Suzuki et al. 2008). Sperm obtained from the testis-specific Lrrc6 knockout (Lrrc6f/f;Nanos3Cre/+) mouse were completely immotile (Fig. 3A; Movie S8 in Supporting Information). Thus, all types of the motile cilia that were examined lost motility in the absence of Lrrc6.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27353389","rdfs:label":"Inaba et al. 2016","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7063ef1e-8ce2-4f35-a765-f08efc2e541a_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b8c21f8f-9deb-4cac-8f3a-a270f2de056f","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6876b3c1-06de-4eca-bc00-1bb9fdb6435c","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Consistent with the axonemal defect observed in affected subjects, ultrastructural analyses of cilia from silenced airway epithelial cells had truncated or absent dynein arms","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23527195","rdfs:label":"Horani, et al. 2013"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7063ef1e-8ce2-4f35-a765-f08efc2e541a_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7a619247-038c-4fd1-b289-2497e8ca84eb","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5a6e7bee-8304-4383-a242-e1fa698bc89f","type":"Finding","dc:description":"ZMYND10 serves as a chaperone, guiding cellular development and function.

Total RNA was extracted from whole blood. To confirm whether the Notch pathway was abnormally activated in patients with PCD, real-time PCR was conducted for the Notch pathway–related and downstream target genes, including ADAM17, Cyclin D3, p21, MYC, and HES1.","phenotypeFreeText":"Patient has a homozygous variant","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0002110","obo:HP_0012387","obo:HP_0001696","obo:HP_0011947"],"sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1b8dcf53-ee90-44da-b0ee-5e04c914bcf9_variant_evidence_item"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria","strengthScore":3},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4836e473-b2c3-4284-a2dc-e2163f75a953_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/24752ffb-2b5b-47b8-8e04-8c9add65e9b6","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"This variant was downscored due to consanguinity","calculatedScore":1.0,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/24752ffb-2b5b-47b8-8e04-8c9add65e9b6_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"The patient’s nasal epithelial cells showed absent LRRC6 expression (Figure 2D).","functionalDataSupport":"Yes"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/24752ffb-2b5b-47b8-8e04-8c9add65e9b6_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23527195","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/291a140b-b6b7-4dfd-97e2-08471d6383eb","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_012472.6(DNAAF11):c.436G>C (p.Asp146His)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA343819"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":0.2},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4836e473-b2c3-4284-a2dc-e2163f75a953","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23527195","rdfs:label":"A III-1","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":28,"allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/291a140b-b6b7-4dfd-97e2-08471d6383eb"},"detectionMethod":"Genetic linkage analysis was performed on the patient and two affected siblings.
