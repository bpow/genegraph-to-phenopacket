This disease entity represents a spectrum of disorder, ranging from episodic migraine and hemiparesis to the more severe form characterized by ataxia, slurred speech, and seizures. Eight unique variants, most of which are missense, have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data.\nVariants in this gene have been reported in at least eight probands in eight publications (PMIDs: 27829685, 16116111, 29062094, 19139306, 29208948, 29066757, 32754645, 25497598). Functional studies performed on the seven observed missense variants demonstrate several possible pathogenic mechanisms depending on the mutation, with the most severe variants (p.M128R, p.P290R, and p.T318A) causing a gain-of-function altered glutamate transport and anion channels. Other variants usually cause increased amounts of transcribed protein for similar effectiveness to WT, indicating a haploinsufficency defect in glutamate uptake and anion currents (Chivukula et al., PMID: 32741053). Of note, this gene has also been implicated in Tourette syndrome and ADHD/Autism susceptibility (PMIDs: 21233784, 27296938). These will be assessed separately\nThis gene-disease association is supported primarily by a knock-in mouse model of the most characterized variant P290R which recapitulated the phenotypes of the human disorder. Several instances of functional evidence have also been characterized, with a knock-out model organism demonstrating altered glutamate transport and motor/neurological phenotypes as well as a thorough functional characterization of six missense variants in HEK293 cells.\nIn summary, SLC1A3 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant episodic ataxia. Although more published genetic evidence would allow for further characterization, the large amount of experimental data available provides important evidence towards its pathogenicity.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5e1559a0-faba-4e85-8cf3-3f47378c6c92","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3bcae41b-3438-4e82-8f29-83cca7f142f0","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3bcae41b-3438-4e82-8f29-83cca7f142f0_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10011","date":"2020-11-03T19:50:08.579Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3bcae41b-3438-4e82-8f29-83cca7f142f0_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10011","date":"2020-10-09T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3bcae41b-3438-4e82-8f29-83cca7f142f0_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3bcae41b-3438-4e82-8f29-83cca7f142f0_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ab0ee4b3-738d-4c86-9d92-79b63d51a223","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"This knock-in of a known pathogenic human variant model clearly recapitulates the important phenotypes of the Episodic Ataxia Type 6, with seizures, ataxia, and migraine neurological signs all being observed in these organisms.

Even so, mutant mice demonstrated significant phenotypes indicative of human Episodic Ataxia including epilepsy, ataxia, and reduced motor/gait coordination. In order to determine the pathogenc mechanism, cerebellar Bergmann glia cells were examined to find a pronounced age-dependent reduction of cell numbers between P10 and P20. Immunostaining showed decreased numbers of somata and expression, demonstrating that the EAAT1 mutants were subject to cell death. Granule cell migration was also impaired during development, coupled with invasion of reactive astrocytes into the molecular layer demonstrating attempted repair. Following from this change, Purkinje neurons were examined and found to have been reduced and the morphology altered in mutant mice. As the P290R variant is known to increase EAAT1 anion currents in heterologous expression systems, measurement of these currents in mouse Bergmann glia cells showed significantly increased current, decreased Cl- concentration, and a resulting higher TUNEL expression in these cells, indicating earlier apoptosis events of these cell types. Spiking activities and developmental acceleration is absent in these cell types, likely due to progressive deterioration. This was verified by an observation of cerebellar size, where mutant cerebellar tissue showed generalized degeneration compared to the WT mice.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32954283","rdfs:label":"SLC1A3 Knock-In Mice","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":3}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":3},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3bcae41b-3438-4e82-8f29-83cca7f142f0_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/11949ca5-65c3-4939-bfe1-81e293e5d951","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Each of these variants demonstrated altered function of some fashion when observed in HEK293 cells.
