BLNK encodes a cytoplasmic linker or adaptor protein that plays a critical role in B cell development. Agammaglobulinemia is characterized by absence of circulating B cells and low or absent serum immunoglobulin levels (PMID: 10583958). BLNK was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Agammaglobulinemia 4 in 1999 (Minegishi et al, PMID: 10583958). Variants reported in this gene thus far include missense, nonsense, frameshift and splice site variants. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. \n   \nSummary of Case Level Data (7.5 points):\nThere have been 8 patients, including a sibling pair, from 6 publications, till date, reported with biallelic variants in BLNK (PMID: 10583958, 24582315, 30619340, 25893637, 32194234, 19302039). The mechanism of disease is expected to be biallelic loss of function. \n\nSummary of experimental data (4.5 points):\nThis gene-disease association is supported by in-vitro functional assays and animal models. BLNK is expressed in B lymphocytes (PMID: 10583957). BLNK is involved in BCR activation and B cell differentiation (PMID: 9697839). BLNK defects lead to a block of B-cell differentiation from the pro-B cell to the pre-B cell stage and accumulation of immature B cells (PMID: 24582315). A targeted knock-out mouse model (PMID: 10583957) has been reported that recapitulates the B-cell defect.  \n  \nIn summary, the evidence to support the gene-disease relationship of BLNK and Agammaglobulinemia 4 is definitive. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Antibody Immunodeficiency GCEP on March 16, 2021 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2ee5c475-43b5-4a07-9e26-9e8b0e37addf","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2e1d2e1b-52a6-4371-9055-0e1cc74da39d","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2e1d2e1b-52a6-4371-9055-0e1cc74da39d_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10080","date":"2021-03-16T13:27:48.373Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2e1d2e1b-52a6-4371-9055-0e1cc74da39d_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10080","date":"2021-03-16T13:28:18.821Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2e1d2e1b-52a6-4371-9055-0e1cc74da39d_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2e1d2e1b-52a6-4371-9055-0e1cc74da39d_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7a77bf2b-53c7-49e7-bdd4-bb5224d993a3","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The evidence is scored default points as the mouse model recapitulates the reduction in B cell number and hypogammaglobulinemia phenotypes that are noted in humans.
