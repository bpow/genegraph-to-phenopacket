{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c117fb70-58a2-463c-9ca4-eb58f8401377v1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"The relationship between *NDUFAF1* and primary mitochondrial disease was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of February 17, 2022. The *NDUFAF1* gene encodes the NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) assembly factor I. Defects of this protein lead to complex I deficiency. \n\nThe *NDUFAF1* gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive primary mitochondrial disease in 2007 (PMID: 17557076). While various names have been given to the constellation of features seen in those with *NDUFAF1*-related disease, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *NDUFAF1* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to per the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included four variants in two cases from two publications (PMIDs: 17557076, 21931170). No segregation data were available. Loss of function resulting in a complex I assembly defect is implicated as the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease association is also supported by known biochemical function, functional alterations in patient and non-patient cells, and animal models (PMIDs: 27509854, 27626371, 18940309, 22387847, 23226344).\n\nIn summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on February 17, 2022 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c117fb70-58a2-463c-9ca4-eb58f8401377","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/20bd44f6-360d-42ef-ba08-549773282d2e","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/20bd44f6-360d-42ef-ba08-549773282d2e_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2022-02-17T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/20bd44f6-360d-42ef-ba08-549773282d2e_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2022-10-13T18:56:06.477Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/20bd44f6-360d-42ef-ba08-549773282d2e_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/20bd44f6-360d-42ef-ba08-549773282d2e_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3dbfc90f-5720-47e2-9b3e-f2aef709b651","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Biochemical dysfunction: reduced complex I activity 0.5 pts (could score reduced growth 0.5 pts)","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4e068648-939e-4cb6-847e-c21c5844c36f","type":"Finding","dc:description":"C50B8.3, ortholog of NDUFAF1, RNAi against the ortholog was used to reduce mRNA levels to approx 40%\nBN-PAGE used to quantify complex I in-gel activities, C50B8.3(RNAi) animals showed an average IGA of 72.2% (±18,3 SD).
