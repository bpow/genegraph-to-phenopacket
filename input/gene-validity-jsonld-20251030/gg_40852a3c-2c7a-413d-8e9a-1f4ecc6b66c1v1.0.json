COX10 was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Leigh syndrome spectrum in 2003 (Antonicka et al., PMID: 12928484).  Six unique variants predicted to cause a loss of or reduced function of the protein have been reported in ClinVar.  Complex IV deficiency is the mechanism of disease for this gene. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 2 probands with Leigh syndrome spectrum in 2 different publications (PMID 12928484, 15455402). This gene-disease association is further supported by the function of the gene product, expression, and studies in patient cell lines and COX10 mouse models.  In summary, there is moderate evidence to support the relationship between COX10 and autosomal recessive Leigh syndrome spectrum. This classification was approved by the NICHD U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on April 22, 2019 (SOP Version 6).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/40852a3c-2c7a-413d-8e9a-1f4ecc6b66c1","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/48794019-db9d-47c2-9977-4dc76a7d07b3","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/48794019-db9d-47c2-9977-4dc76a7d07b3_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/48794019-db9d-47c2-9977-4dc76a7d07b3_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2019-05-20T18:28:01.393Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/48794019-db9d-47c2-9977-4dc76a7d07b3_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4d771e1b-8289-4045-9576-abf559a91e4a_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The underlying genetic defect in patient was identified by functional complementation using a panel of retroviral vectors expressing individual human COX assembly genes (16).

According to Leigh map at least 4 other complex IV assembly units (PET100, COX15, SURF1, and SCO2) have been implicated in causing Leigh syndrome (Rahman et al 2017 PMID: 27977873).
