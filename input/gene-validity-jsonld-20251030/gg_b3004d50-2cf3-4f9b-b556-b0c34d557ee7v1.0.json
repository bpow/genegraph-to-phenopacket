Variants in NEB were first reported in humans with this disease as early as 1999 (Pelin et al. 1999, PMID: 10051637). At least 17 variants (e.g. missense, nonsense, frameshift) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level\ndata and experimental data.\nVariants in this gene have been reported in at least 11 probands in 3 publications (PMIDs: 30517146, 10051637, 27105866). Of note is that all curated probands have at least one predicted null variant. Much more evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism for disease is homozygous loss of function, with the lack of actin organization contributing to skeletal muscle degradation and disorganization as well as the reduced contractile strength and calcium sensitivity causing muscle weakness and other related symptoms.\nThis gene-disease association is supported by two separate mouse models, each recapitulating the base phenotype of the disorder. There are several other pieces of functional evidence, most notably the interactions with KLHL40, the actin-binding function of the protein, expression primarily in the muscle, and cultured muscle fiber cells showing reduced contractile strength compared to controls. There is more experimental evidence available, but the maximum has been reached.\nIn summary, NEB is definitively associated with Autosomal Recessive Nemaline Myopathy 2. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Congenital Myopathy Working Group on 10/21/19.\n(SOP Version 7).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b3004d50-2cf3-4f9b-b556-b0c34d557ee7","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/796dd762-f35c-425a-be3f-05424324ade0","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/796dd762-f35c-425a-be3f-05424324ade0_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10031","date":"2019-10-21T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/796dd762-f35c-425a-be3f-05424324ade0_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10031","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/796dd762-f35c-425a-be3f-05424324ade0_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a0c84692-7d90-420a-a784-aab3555a2333_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Although there is minimal phenotypic evidence and the parents are consanguineous, the parental testing and additional linkage analysis of this gene region supports the proband enough to give a default score.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bbff95c6-2f3d-4edd-b4fb-851da55e675f","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10051637","rdfs:label":"5","ageType":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/","ageUnit":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/","detectionMethod":"Genomic DNA was extracted from blood and RNA isolated from lymphoblast cell lines.
