The authors reported a male proband with a *de novo* deletion spanning *SHANK1* and *SYT3*, and a multigenerational family with six individuals carrying a deletion of *SHANK1* and *CLEC11A*, in which the males, but not the carrier mothers, had ASD. None of these cases were awarded points in this curation because the deletions encompass other genes. Subsequently, May et al. (2021, PMID: 34113010) reported *de novo* truncating variants in *SHANK1* in six probands with a spectrum of neurodevelopmental disorders, including motor and speech delays, intellectual disability or learning disabilities, ASD, hypotonia, and seizures. At least 9 additional probands with *SHANK1* truncating variants and complex neurodevelopmental disorder, including intellectual disability, developmental delay, ASD, and epilepsy, have been reported in large cohort studies (PMIDs: 27824329, 29100083, 33057194, 34113010, 34374989, 35982160, 36980980). Seven *de novo* truncating variants (nonsense, frameshift, and splice) that have been reported in seven probands in two publications (PMIDs: 27824329, 34113010) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. In addition to the two unaffected deletion carrier mothers mentioned above (PMID: 22503632), a *SHANK1* *de novo* truncating variant was observed in an unaffected male sibling of an ASD proband (PMID: 35982160), suggesting incomplete penetrance. The mechanism of pathogenicity is loss of function (PMID: 34113010). \n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence, including functional alteration, biochemical function, and animal models. *SHANK1* is a member of the SHANK gene family, which includes *SHANK1*, *SHANK2*, and *SHANK3*, and encodes scaffolding proteins that are enriched in the postsynaptic density of glutamatergic synapses. *SHANK2* and *SHANK3* are also involved in neurodevelopmental disorders associated with ASD and intellectual disability.\n \nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *SHANK1* and autosomal dominant complex neurodevelopmental disorder. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel on March 20, 2024 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2e57a0a6-0400-40dd-9c6c-108dd398e154","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/57f9ab85-914e-4eec-ae66-efc80d612ef8","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/57f9ab85-914e-4eec-ae66-efc80d612ef8_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2024-03-20T04:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/57f9ab85-914e-4eec-ae66-efc80d612ef8_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2024-10-29T14:32:39.437Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/57f9ab85-914e-4eec-ae66-efc80d612ef8_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/57f9ab85-914e-4eec-ae66-efc80d612ef8_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/087a119d-f05e-46eb-88dc-fde5d8a736d1","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The score is upgraded because the synaptic function of Shank1, which is shared with Shank2 and Shank3, both of which have definitive relationships to ID and ASD, provides strong evidence linking Shank1 to ID and ASD.
