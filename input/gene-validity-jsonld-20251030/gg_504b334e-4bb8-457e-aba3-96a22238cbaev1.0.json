{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/504b334e-4bb8-457e-aba3-96a22238cbaev1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"The relationship between NDUFA13 and Leigh syndrome spectrum was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of October 12, 2020. This gene is also known as GRIM19. The NDUFA13 gene encodes NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) subunit A13, which plays a role in complex I assembly and function within the mitochondria.  Defects of this protein lead to complex I deficiency.\n\nThe NDUFA13 gene was first reported in association with autosomal recessive Leigh syndrome spectrum in 2015 (PMID: 25901006). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included three variants identified in two cases from two publications (PMID: 25901006, 32722639). No segregation data were available. Loss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease association is also supported by known protein interaction, functional alteration in patient cells, and animal models (PMIDs: 27509854, 25901006, 32722639, 15367666).\n\nIn summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on October 12, 2020 (SOP Version 7).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/504b334e-4bb8-457e-aba3-96a22238cbae","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0bc56951-c454-4e79-95f3-7ffda20482b7","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0bc56951-c454-4e79-95f3-7ffda20482b7_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2021-01-21T00:54:22.483Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0bc56951-c454-4e79-95f3-7ffda20482b7_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2021-01-21T00:54:11.435Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0bc56951-c454-4e79-95f3-7ffda20482b7_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/39bba053-4c85-40df-a272-9ba6b8c4f72d_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Fibroblast primary cultures from the affected siblings; western blot showed reduced protein levels for NDUFA13, NDUFA9 and NDUFB8 compared to controls  (mean reduction of 70% for NDUFA13; 95% for NDUFA9 and 90% for NDUFB8) , CII and β-actin proteins normal.","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6a569017-1e30-4d4b-9904-b5449d82a6cb","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25901006","rdfs:label":"Patient 1","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":12,"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"early onset hypotonia, dyskinesia and sensorial deficiencies\npsychomotor retardation during first year\nat 13 months: axial hypotonia, poor head control, choreoathetoid movements of limbs and face, limited ocular contact\nPyramidal signs worsened progressively, \nOptic atrophy diagnosed at 3 .5 years\nAt 11.5 years severely handicapped, without occurrence of mental or motor regression; axial hypotonia, insufficient head control with inability to sit unaided, lower limb spasticity and some degree of global akinesia.
