STISS is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by delayed psychomotor development, intellectual disability, behavioral issues, mild craniofacial anomalies and variable congenital defects. Ten variants (8 nonsense and 2 splice site) that have been reported in 10 probands in 3 publications (PMIDs: 28132691, 30421579, 34906456) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. \n\nThe mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss-of-function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by an animal model (PMIDs: 28132691). A *PSMD12* zebrafish CRISPR/Cas9 knockout model exhibited microcephaly, decreased convolution of the renal tubules, and abnormal craniofacial morphology consistent with phenotypes in individuals with STISS (PMIDs: 28132691).  \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *PSMD12* and autosomal dominant Stankiewicz-Isidor Syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism GCEP on March 5, 2024 (SOP Version 10).

We observed that the size of the optic tecta was significantly smaller in CRISPR F0 mutants than in the control larvae.\n\nIn addition, the authors assessed whether psmd12 was also required for renal development by quantifying the area of proximal tubule convolution in 4 dpf F0 psmd12 mutants.  Mutant zebrafish embryos displayed qualitative defects of the proximal tubule, including absent, reduced, or v-shaped tubules. They then measured the area of the renal tubules in both mutants and controls and observed that the area of the proximal convolution was significantly smaller in F0 mutants (p ≤ 0.0001, n = 30–47 larvae/batch, repeated) than in controls \n\nThe authors state that it has been previously shown that zebrafish models of mispatterned craniofacial cartilage reflect craniofacial abnormalities in humans. So, they injected CRISPR sgRNA into embryos at the 1-cell stage. They were able to quantify two types of craniofacial abnormalities from GFP-positive cells in -1.4col1a1:egfp CRISPR F0 mutants. They observed a significantly broadened angle of the ceratohyal and a significant delay in rostrocaudal ceratobranchial (cb) arch patterning in mutants; F0 mutants showed a reduced number of cb pairs.
