Variants in LMOD3 were first reported in humans with this disease in 2014 (Yuen et al., 25250574). At least 17 variants (e.g. missense, in-frame indel, nonsense, frameshift) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data.\nSummary of Case Level Data: 12 Points\nVariants in this gene have been reported in at least 19 probands in 3 publications (28815944, 30291184), most of which are due to loss of function mutations leading to severe phenotypes. Although some of the probands were unable to be counted due to absent parental testing, the genetic evidence far exceeded the maximum available. Slightly more evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism for disease appears to be homozygous loss of function, as demonstrated by KO mouse models and the autosomal recessive inheritance.\nSummary of Experimental Data: 5.5 Points\nThis gene-disease association is supported by two separate mouse models, each recapitulating the base phenotype of the disorder. There are several other pieces of functional evidence, most notably the interactions with KLHL40, the actin-binding function of the protein, and expression primarily in the muscle.\nIn summary, LMOD3 is definitively associated with Nemaline Myopathy 10. Although the research is relatively recent, the amount and quality of the evidence present is more than enough to demonstrate this association. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Aminoacidopathy Working Group on 09/09/2019.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f5f17a68-d969-43ca-824b-7f8604f305ad","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/af248a78-5ef6-4c0b-b174-f43cc4688ec9","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/af248a78-5ef6-4c0b-b174-f43cc4688ec9_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10031","date":"2019-09-09T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/af248a78-5ef6-4c0b-b174-f43cc4688ec9_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10031","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/af248a78-5ef6-4c0b-b174-f43cc4688ec9_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/af248a78-5ef6-4c0b-b174-f43cc4688ec9_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/18dc61da-8b7f-4666-b6a3-b0feee17c0a1","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The nemaline bodies and muscle weakness recapitulate the phenotype of the nemaline myopathy with relatively high accuracy.
