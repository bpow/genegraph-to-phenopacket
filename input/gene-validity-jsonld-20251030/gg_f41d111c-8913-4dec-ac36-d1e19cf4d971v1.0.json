Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome 11 is a subtype of Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome, characterized by oculocutaneous albinism, bleeding diathesis, and platelet dysfunction.  BLOC1S5 encodes subunit 5 of the Biogenesis of Lysome-related Organelles Complex 1, BLOC-1, which is required for normal biogenesis of specialized organelles of the endosomal-lysosomal system, such as melanosomes and platelet dense granules (PMID: 15102850). Variants in 4 of the 8 subunits of BLOC-1 have been associated with HPS in humans (Li et al., 2003, PMID: 12923531; Morgen et al., 2006 PMID: 16385460; Badolato et al., 2012, PMID: 22461475; Pennamen et al., 2020, PMID: 32565547).  Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level and experimental data.\n\nThe mechanism of disease is expected to be biallelic loss of function.\n\nSummary of Case Level Data (9.5 points): Four variants (Nonsense, frameshift, canonical splicing, and multi exon deletion) in this gene have been reported in 4 probands in 3 publications (PMID: 32565547, 34685610, 34058075). A variant in this gene segregated with disease in 1 additional family member (PMID: 34685610).\n\nSummary of Experimental Data (4.25 points): This gene-disease association is supported by studies of protein interaction with other subunits of BLOC-1 (PMID: 12923531), mouse (muted) (PMID: 11912185) and zebrafish (PMID: 34058075) model systems that recapitulate the HPS phenotype, and rescue models in mouse melanocytes (PMID: 32565547).\n\nIn summary, BLOC1S5 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome 11. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has held up over time.\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f41d111c-8913-4dec-ac36-d1e19cf4d971","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/85cca8f5-d263-42c4-b84a-2d49deeee682","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/85cca8f5-d263-42c4-b84a-2d49deeee682_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2024-05-01T17:03:29.323Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/85cca8f5-d263-42c4-b84a-2d49deeee682_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2023-09-06T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/85cca8f5-d263-42c4-b84a-2d49deeee682_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/87a724bf-835b-4201-82bf-0159eafc9f06_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c2276e72-4f05-41a8-a2c2-2e18e336f471","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"RT-PCR demonstrated loss of exons 3 and 4.
