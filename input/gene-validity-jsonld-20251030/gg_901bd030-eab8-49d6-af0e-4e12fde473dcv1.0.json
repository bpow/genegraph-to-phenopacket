Since that time, 94 variants (e.g. missense, in-frame indel, nonsense, frameshift, large deletion, complex rearrangement, etc) have been reported with intellectual disability and associated co-morbidities in humans. For this reason, this gene has been curated using the more comprehensive disease term “complex neurodevelopmental disorder” (MONDO:0100038). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Variants in GRIN2B have been reported in over 100 probands in 28 publications. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for “definitive” genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism for disease is mixed with both loss of function and gain of function observed (PMID: 27818011). This gene-disease association is supported by experimental evidence including in vitro functional assays, expression/localization studies, and animal models (6 pts.). In summary, GRIN2B is definitively associated with autosomal dominant complex neurodevelopmental disorder. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the Epilepsy Gene Curation Expert Panel on 3/19/2019 (SOP Version 6).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/901bd030-eab8-49d6-af0e-4e12fde473dc","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ff8d9346-2ab7-4ef1-9071-9b8ae4178174","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ff8d9346-2ab7-4ef1-9071-9b8ae4178174_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10005","date":"2019-03-19T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ff8d9346-2ab7-4ef1-9071-9b8ae4178174_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10005","date":"2020-09-16T19:23:24.874Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ff8d9346-2ab7-4ef1-9071-9b8ae4178174_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ff8d9346-2ab7-4ef1-9071-9b8ae4178174_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0b16015c-38c3-4cc1-8429-5e5ddc088518","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ba327380-f3ed-418c-bc48-8e05e1f9ab0f","type":"Finding","dc:description":"The hippocampus showed rapid decay in their excitatory postsynaptic current (ESPC) and differennces in long term depression were observed.

Mice died at birth but, they could survive with hand feeding. Most of the newborn mice demonstrated rhythmic jaw movements however, some mice failed to demonstrate suckling response. It was found that epsilon 2 subunit mutant mice were defective in the suckling response. Wild-type and heterozygous mice exhibited the suckling response. \nThe primary reason of death in the epsilon 2 subunit mutant mice was the defect in the suckling response which lead to a lack of nutrition. This was confirmed by hand feeding all mice for 2-3 days. The mutant mice demonstrated no suckling movements after 3 days of hand feeding.\nThe neuronal pattern failed to form in the brainstem trigeminal complex in the mutant mice. Similar histological features were observed between the wild-type and mutant mice in the other brain regions, as well. The brains of the mutant mice as well as the wild-type mice developed during 2 days of hand feeding. Suckling responses are regulated by complex interactions between motor and sensory neuronal pathways and linked to the CNS through the brainstem trigeminal complex.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8789948","rdfs:label":"NMDA Receptor epsilon 2 Subunit Mutant Mice","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ff8d9346-2ab7-4ef1-9071-9b8ae4178174_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e79110b3-902e-40fd-acf2-7e21c9b514e5","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The gene-disease relationship is greatly supported by the evidence in this paper, which demonstrates that the mechanism for disease is both loss of function and gain of function.","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d177fbc7-f48d-43c9-b6e2-a616a5664825","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"In terms of variation intolerance of domains within GluN2A and GluN2B, it was found that the agonist binding domain, linker regions, and transmembrane domain demonstrated unusually low levels of missense variation in the general population despite the presence of synonymous variation suggesting that missense variation may be affected by negative selection compared to the amino- and carboxy-terminal domains. GRIN2B exhibited less tolerance to variation than GRIN2A, with fewer of the population missense variants occurring in the agonist binding domain of GRIN2B compared to GRIN2A.\n\nTo review NMDAR function and the rare variants in the agonist binding domain after glutamate potency, glutamate and glycine potency was observed in NMDARs expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Eleven of the variants studied reduced glutamate potency and nine of the variants enhanced glutamate potency, with the most notable variant being a 4.5-fold decrease in glutamate (p.Arg696His). This suggests that rare variants in the agonist binding domain decreased glutamate potency, remarkably. Single mutant GluN2 subunit can have significant effects on NMDAR function.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27839871","rdfs:label":"NMDA Receptor Dysregulation by Rare Variants"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":6},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ff8d9346-2ab7-4ef1-9071-9b8ae4178174_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ff8d9346-2ab7-4ef1-9071-9b8ae4178174_ad_dn_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/42275261-6fb1-4dd0-abe0-c39a4118af93_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/402cd462-7210-43f1-aa9e-3d0da618d49f","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23160955","rdfs:label":"SupplementalTable3_Row5_Missense","ageType":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/","ageUnit":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/","detectionMethod":"","firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"Autism","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001249","obo:HP_0000717"],"previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/42275261-6fb1-4dd0-abe0-c39a4118af93_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23160955","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/41fa6669-0449-490a-97fa-27fb7b7f6933","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000834.4(GRIN2B):c.1367G>A (p.Cys456Tyr)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA130435"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:DeNovoAlleleOrigin"}}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADDeNovoCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2c62a45c-fb3e-4351-8cc7-1299ffdff0bc_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"While de novo status is stated, the confirmation of parental status was not confirmed in this report.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/afe53878-525e-4275-abbe-fa1698243f7c","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24272827","rdfs:label":"SupplementalTable3_Row11_Missense","ageType":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/","ageUnit":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/","detectionMethod":"","firstTestingMethod":"Next generation sequencing panels","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001256","obo:HP_0002384","obo:HP_0002133"],"previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2c62a45c-fb3e-4351-8cc7-1299ffdff0bc_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24272827","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5abb4f47-0c12-473a-b31a-4c2eba589958","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000834.4(GRIN2B):c.1619G>A (p.Arg540His)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA174970"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:DeNovoAlleleOrigin"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"No"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADDeNovoCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/232198c5-c6b2-4012-805f-095cd4fb77e2_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"For PS2 both maternity and paternity should be confirmed.
