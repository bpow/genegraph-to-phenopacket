{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a0c82662-d1ab-40cf-9867-c9a61d6f4e53v1.2","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"The *CHD1* gene encodes an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling protein. Although several *de novo* variants in *CHD1* had been observed in large cohort studies of individuals with autism and developmental disorders (PMIDs: 25363760, 25363768, 28135719), the first report focusing on variants in *CHD1* as a cause of autosomal dominant complex neurodevelopmental disorder was published in 2018 (Pilarowski et al., PMID: 28866611). Affected individuals present with developmental delay, hypotonia, and speech apraxia; other variable features include autism, seizures, and facial dysmorphic features. \n\nFifteen missense variants that have been reported in 15 probands in eight publications (PMIDs: 25363760, 25418537, 28135719, 28866611, 33057194, 35982159, 36625521; doi: 10.5734/JGM.2022.19.2.111) are included in this curation. Most of the variants are *de novo* and were reported in large exome sequencing studies of autism or developmental disorders, without detailed phenotype description or functional validation. A *de novo* missense  variant reported by Sunwoo et al. (doi: 10.5734/JGM.2022.19.2.111) in a Korean male with clinical features compatible with Pilarowski-Bjornsson syndrome cannot formally be documented in the curation at this time, as this report does not have a PMID. Functional studies were performed for only two *de novo* missense variants that showed increased levels of a closed chromatin modification (H3K27me3) in patient fibroblasts (PMIDs: 28866611, 36625521). The mechanism of disease for missense variants has been hypothesized to be dominant negative (PMID: 28866611), but further functional studies are needed to clarify this issue. Two individuals with a *CHD1* gene deletion have been reported with no obvious neurodevelopmental phenotype; one has isolated talipes equinovarus and the other cleft lip and palate (PMIDs: 28866611, 32918369). At least three patients with neurodevelopmental disorders and protein truncating variants have also been reported (PMIDs: 25418537, 33057194, 38174187), but were not scored in this curation because it is currently unclear if loss of function is a disease mechanism. CHD1 is constrained for both missense (Z = 4.21, gnomAD v2.1.1) and loss-of-function variants (pLI = 1). More evidence is needed to clarify the pathogenicity of missense variants reported without functional evidence and of protein truncating variants. \n\nThis gene-disease relationship is further supported by CHD1 biochemical function, as several other genes encoding chromodomain helicase DNA binding proteins, including *CHD2*, *CHD3*, *CHD4*, *CHD5*, *CHD7*, and *CHD8*, have also been implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders.\n\nIn summary, there is limited evidence to support the relationship between *CHD1* and autosomal dominant complex neurodevelopmental disorder. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel on April 17, 2024 (SOP Version 10).\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a0c82662-d1ab-40cf-9867-c9a61d6f4e53","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1c8b091b-7709-4344-947b-ec74e8dbad58","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1c8b091b-7709-4344-947b-ec74e8dbad58_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2024-04-17T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1c8b091b-7709-4344-947b-ec74e8dbad58_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2025-03-04T17:48:00.836Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["ErrorClarification"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1c8b091b-7709-4344-947b-ec74e8dbad58_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1c8b091b-7709-4344-947b-ec74e8dbad58_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/70ee6e74-06df-4ba5-aa35-9ff59e67dc31","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Six of the nine genes of the CHD gene family are implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cdf363d8-fae3-4f1c-96e7-5fc7a93f59bf","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Six genes encoding members of the chromodomain helicase DNA binding (CHD) protein family have been implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders: CHD2, CHD3, CHD4, CHD5, CHD7, and CHD8.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16372014","rdfs:label":"chromodomain helicase DNA binding (CHD) proteins","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionA"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1c8b091b-7709-4344-947b-ec74e8dbad58_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cdae265d-eae2-4f5a-85b5-afe515cefaa4","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Missense variant with no functional evidence of pathogenicity.
