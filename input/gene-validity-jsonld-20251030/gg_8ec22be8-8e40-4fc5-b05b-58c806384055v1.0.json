{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8ec22be8-8e40-4fc5-b05b-58c806384055v1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"WAS was first reported in relation to X-linked recessive severe congenital neutropenia in 2001 (Devriendt K, et al., 2001, PMID: 11242115). Severe congenital neutropenia is typically characterized by severe neutropenia, recurrent bacterial infections, and a maturation arrest at the promyelocyte/myelocyte stage in the bone marrow. Of note, WAS is also reported in relation to Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome and X-linked thrombocytopenia, diseases with different phenotypes characterized by platelet defects such as thrombocytopenia and small platelets, and in Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome this is accompanied by eczema and variable immunodeficiency caused by diminished lymphocyte function and numbers. Neutrophil counts, however, are normal in Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome and X-linked thrombocytopenia. All Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome and X-linked thrombocytopenia mutations in WAS characterized so far result in partial or complete loss of WASP function, whereas those related to neutropenia are gain of function, resulting from lost autoinhibitory regulation of WASP with consequent enhanced activation. Thus, per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found differences in molecular mechanism and phenotypic variability, and WAS related X-linked recessive severe congenital neutropenia is considered a distinct disease entity while Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome and X-linked thrombocytopenia are considered a lumped entity along a continuum of disease. The curation for Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (including X-linked thrombocytopenia) has been curated separately by the Hereditary Cancer GCEP.\n\nThe curation of WAS related X-linked recessive severe congenital neutropenia includes both case-level and experimental evidence. Six missense variants, in the GTPase-binding domain, have been reported in 11 probands, and 11 additional affected family members, in eight publications (PMIDs: 11242115, 16804117, 19006568, 28956125, 29991546, 31352750, 31732620, 34384840). Experimental evidence includes expression of WAS in relevant tissues of lymphocytes, spleen and thymus (PMID: 8069912) and the biochemical function of WAS in actin filament polymerization (PMID: 8625410), consistent with the increased actin polymerization observed in both patient (PMID: 16804117, 30124469) and non-patient (PMID: 11242115) cells harboring these gain of function mutations. Additionally, transgenic zebrafish (PMID: 23868979) and knockin mouse models recapitulate the hyperactive neutrophils observed in patients (PMID: 30124469). In summary, WAS is definitively associated with X-linked recessive severe congenital neutropenia. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen SCID-CID GCEP on the meeting date of 11/18/2021 (SOPv8).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8ec22be8-8e40-4fc5-b05b-58c806384055","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/49c66050-ab36-4359-8d78-b7ba5bef80d2","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/49c66050-ab36-4359-8d78-b7ba5bef80d2_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10081","date":"2021-11-18T17:10:22.515Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/49c66050-ab36-4359-8d78-b7ba5bef80d2_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10081","date":"2021-11-18T17:10:12.085Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/49c66050-ab36-4359-8d78-b7ba5bef80d2_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/eff4870e-e135-485c-b3a2-fcf45d4273f3","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"second occurrence of variant","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/eff4870e-e135-485c-b3a2-fcf45d4273f3_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34384840","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8f47c42c-f8e5-4ffa-a9ed-708daff4a12e","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000377.3(WAS):c.812T>C (p.Phe271Ser)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA412872220"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:AlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Heterozygous"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":0.1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/79fdaf5f-66b5-4475-ac1e-fbef93ae1722","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"There is significant functional evidence for constitutive activation due to L270P induced unfolding as well as enhanced actin polymerization.

Additionally the authors  examined the functional effects of the L270P mutation in Arp2/3-mediated actin polymerization assays. As previously reported purified Arp2/3 complex had a weak ability to stimulate formation of actin filaments in monomeric G-actin solution but addition of FL7 (a protein spanning from the GTPase-binding domain to the C terminus of the protein) enhanced polymerization. FL7-L270P mutation caused a greater increase in the rate of polymerization, to 58,000 per second, and decreased the lag time to only 300 seconds. Thus, in accordance with the destabilization of the autoinhibited conformation, WASP L270P demonstrates constitutive, Cdc42-independent Arp2/3 activation of actin polymerization in vitro. Evidence from PMID: 24402308 further shows that L270P causing a tendency to localize in the nucleus compared to WT and gene transcription is affected by WASp mutation in myeloid cells. The authors performed microarray analysis and found different expression profiles between WT and L270P WASP-transfected K562 cells.

Cells became binucleated, suggesting a failure of cytokinesis, and micronuclei were formed, indicative of genomic instability. Live cell imaging demonstrated a delay in mitosis from prometaphase to anaphase and confirmed that multinucleation was a result of aborted cytokinesis. During mitosis, filamentous actin was abnormally localized around the spindle and chromosomes throughout their alignment and separation, and it accumulated within the cleavage furrow around the spindle midzone. These findings reveal a novel mechanism for inhibition of myelopoiesis through defective mitosis and cytokinesis due to hyperactivation and mislocalization of actin polymerization. Additionally, PMID: 20354175 found a cellular model of WASpI294T in 300.19 cells, displayed abnormal microvillar architecture, associated with an increase in total cellular F-actin, and resulted in impaired L-selectin-dependent adhesion, suggesting that WASpI294T significantly affects membrane topography and L-selectin–dependent adhesion, which may be linked to defective hematopoiesis and leukocyte function in affected patients.","functionalDataSupport":"Yes"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fd604e17-a2f6-4a5a-8275-1636af78603b_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16804117","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/10af4501-8d62-4e7a-adcd-07bbf68eb0d5"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Heterozygous"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0f8b3d27-c470-4851-bffc-9f18086713ff","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Additional occurrence of this variant.","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0f8b3d27-c470-4851-bffc-9f18086713ff_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"From PMID: 16804117 -- Actin polymerization was assessed in a semiquantitative in vitro assay using Sepharose beads coated with either GST-WASp fusion protein containing either WASp-WT or WASp-Ile294Thr.
