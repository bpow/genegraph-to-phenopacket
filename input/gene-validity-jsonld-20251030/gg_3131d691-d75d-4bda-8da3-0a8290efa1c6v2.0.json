This condition is a subtype of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs), which are progressive neurodegenerative diseases characterized by mental and motor deterioration, epilepsy, ataxia, vision loss, and a reduced life span. The unifying finding in NCL patients is the accumulation, in neurons and many other cell types, of autofluorescent storage material. One characteristic that separates autosomal dominant NCLs from other types of NCLs is the lack of vision loss. There are 13 subtypes of NCLs that are categorized based on the gene that is involved. *DNAJC5* is associated with an autosomal dominant adult NCL (ANCL) with onset ranging from mid 20’s to 40’s.\n\nOne deletion, one duplication, and two missense variants reported in seven probands from five publications (PMID:21820099, PMID:22235333, PMID:22978711, PMID:31919451, PMID:35462699) were scored in this curation. All reported variants have been functionally studied and shown to have effects on subcellular localization and palmitoylation.\nOf the seven probands scored, three with p.Leu115Arg (PMID:21820099, PMID:22235333) and two with p.Leu116del (PMID:2297871) were confirmed independent by the differences in flanking haplotypes. Additional reports regarding these two variants were not scored as the haplotype was either not provided or the identity of the family was unclear (PMID:21820099, PMID:22073189, PMID:29506599, PMID:24277206, PMID:22978711). Supporting gene-level experimental evidence includes protein interaction with the depalmitoylating enzyme palmitoyl-protein thioesterase 1 (PPT1) (PMID: 12134079) and a consistent reduction in protein expression in brain samples from patients with two different variants, p.Leu115Arg and  p.Leu116del (PMID:21820099, PMID:26659577). \n\nIn summary, there is moderate evidence to support the relationship between *DNAJC5* and autosomal dominant ANCL. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged. This gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the Epilepsy GCEP on June 15, 2021. It was reevaluated on January 7, 2025. As a result of this reevaluation additional evidence was added; however, the classification did not change.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3131d691-d75d-4bda-8da3-0a8290efa1c6","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/67f55ef1-b312-4aac-bc04-67beb2405b4f","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","changes":[{"id":"cg:sopChange"},{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"},{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},{"id":"cg:newEvidence"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/67f55ef1-b312-4aac-bc04-67beb2405b4f_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10005","date":"2025-01-07T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/67f55ef1-b312-4aac-bc04-67beb2405b4f_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10005","date":"2025-06-26T20:25:01.526Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["RecurationTiming"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/67f55ef1-b312-4aac-bc04-67beb2405b4f_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/706ef192-3a39-4719-bf7e-b0d8bee08722","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"This is a known recurrent variant seen in families with different haplotypes.","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/706ef192-3a39-4719-bf7e-b0d8bee08722_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21820099","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/451032a6-83be-47ea-9ba9-56f5c7a22d1b","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_025219.3(DNAJC5):c.344T>G (p.Leu115Arg)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA259934"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:AlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Heterozygous"}},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/706ef192-3a39-4719-bf7e-b0d8bee08722_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"Functional studies show that normally palmitoylated cysteine string region of CSPα loses palmitoylation in DNAJC5 mutants p.Leu115Arg and p.Leu116del (PMID: 32042150, 21820099); suggesting that these mutants either have a faster rate of depalmitoylation or that they are consumed in a time-dependent manner into high molecular weight aggregates (PMID: 28127059).

Then exome sequencing was done. Considering an autosomal dominant model of inheritance, we searched for variants that had standard read count threshold ≥10, were present in the heterozygous state in both affected individuals and had a minor allele frequency <0.5% in The Exome Aggregation Consortium database. These parameters did not yield any functionally relevant candidate\nvariant. Lowering the standard read count threshold to ≥5, we found a 30 bp in-frame duplication in DNAJC5. This variant was however not seen in the IGV tool, which allows visualization of sequence alignments. Essential for the variant detection was a visualization of so called softclipped bases, which are reads not matching with the reference sequence in their whole length. Using the visualization of soft-clipped bases we revealed the 30 bp in-frame duplication: chr20:g.62562252_62562281dup (hg19); NM_025219.2:c.370_399dup (p.(Cys124_Cys133dup)).
