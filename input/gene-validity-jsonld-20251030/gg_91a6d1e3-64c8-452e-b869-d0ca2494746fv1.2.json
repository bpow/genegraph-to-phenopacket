Affected individuals present with global developmental delay, intellectual disability, significantly impaired speech, facial dysmorphism, hypotonia, spasticity or gait ataxia, and behavioral abnormalities including autism spectrum disorder or autistic features. Some individuals exhibit behaviors reminiscent of Angelman syndrome, such as frequent laughter and attraction to water. Additional features include progressive microcephaly, seizures, and structural brain abnormalities. \n\nThirteen truncating variants (12 frameshift, 1 nonsense) that have been reported in 13 probands in two publications (PMIDs: 32197073, 35607920) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. Variants were *de novo* in all instances in which parental DNA was available. All the frameshift variants are located in the last exon and are predicted to escape nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. Ten frameshift variants cluster between residues 237 and 276, and replace the KH3 RNA-binding domain by a similar alternative C-terminal sequence. The mechanism of pathogenicity is hypothesized to be partial loss-of-function (hypomorphic) rather than haploinsufficiency, although a possible gain-of-function effect of the new C-terminal extension cannot be excluded (PMID: 32197073).\n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence, including mouse and zebrafish models, and functional alterations in non-patient cells.\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *NOVA2* and autosomal dominant complex neurodevelopmental disorder. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel on May 15, 2024 (SOP Version 11).\n\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/91a6d1e3-64c8-452e-b869-d0ca2494746f","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9b8b1429-10a8-41b6-8ced-7b7bf73a7e8d","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":[{"id":"cg:sopChange"},{"id":"cg:summaryChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9b8b1429-10a8-41b6-8ced-7b7bf73a7e8d_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2024-05-15T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9b8b1429-10a8-41b6-8ced-7b7bf73a7e8d_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2025-06-27T20:52:09.465Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9b8b1429-10a8-41b6-8ced-7b7bf73a7e8d_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f47d5b44-4323-4919-b4d5-b6bce53bc283","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"This patient is the twin of Scala_subject_7 and therefore was not scored.
