RUSAT is characterized by thrombocytopenia that progresses to pancytopenia, in association with congenital proximal fusion of the radius and ulna that results in extremely limited pronation and supination of the forearm (summary by Niihori et al., 2015; PMID: 26581901). One frameshift variant (c.872del) has been reported in two probands in one publication (PMID: 11101832), segregating in four additional affected family members. This gene-disease association is supported by its expression during limb development and a mouse model with skeletal malformations in the limbs (PMID: 7902826), as well as its expression and function in early hematopoietic development (PMID: 16765069). In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship.\n\nThis gene-disease pair was previously evaluated by the HT GCEP on April 28, 2021. It was reevaluated on September 4, 2024. As a result of this reevaluation no new evidence was identified and the classification remained Limited (SOP Version 10).\n\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/59e9f10b-595f-42f8-a430-dabf6fbe61e3","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/48ef111f-28fc-4970-a0ca-8387e9ec2d0e","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","changes":[{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"},{"id":"cg:sopChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/48ef111f-28fc-4970-a0ca-8387e9ec2d0e_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2024-09-04T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/48ef111f-28fc-4970-a0ca-8387e9ec2d0e_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2024-09-05T19:29:40.470Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["RecurationTiming"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/48ef111f-28fc-4970-a0ca-8387e9ec2d0e_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/48ef111f-28fc-4970-a0ca-8387e9ec2d0e_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bc7cf347-b3f4-4391-96a2-57dd66a9bcf6","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Expression in proximodistal-restricted domains in developing mouse limbs is consistent with the radioulnar synostosis seen in patients.","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a0cdb63a-b21e-472d-8d71-48c6b2cc2c84","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Whole-mount in situ hybridizations were performed in mice.
