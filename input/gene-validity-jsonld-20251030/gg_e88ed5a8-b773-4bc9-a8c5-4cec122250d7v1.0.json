{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e88ed5a8-b773-4bc9-a8c5-4cec122250d7v1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"The *HSD11B2* gene is located on chromosome 16 at q22.1 and encodes the hydroxysteroid 11-beta dehydrogenase 2. *HSD11B2* catalyzes the conversion of biologically active 11beta-hydroxyglucocorticoids (11beta-hydroxysteroid) such as cortisol, to inactive 11-ketoglucocorticoids (11-oxosteroid) such as cortisone, in the presence of NAD+ (PMIDs: 7859916, 8538347, 10497248, 22796344, 27927697, 30902677, 33387577, 12788846, 17314322). It is expressed in kidney, placenta, pancreas, prostate, ovary, small intestine and colon, and in lower levels in the spleen and testis (PMID:7859916).\n\n*HSD11B2* was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive apparent mineralocorticoid excess (AME) in 1995 (Mune et al., PMID: 7670488). AME is characterized by low-renin hypertension associated with low aldosterone, metabolic alkalosis, hypernatremia, and hypokalemia due to congenital defect in *HSD11B2* activity. This results in decreased conversion of biologically active cortisol to inactive cortisone allowing cortisol to act as a ligand for the mineralocorticoid receptor, resulting in sodium retention and volume expansion. The mechanism of pathogenicity is known to be loss of function.\n\nSixteen variants (missense, in-frame indel, nonsense, and frameshift) have been reported in twelve probands in six publications (PMIDs: 7670488, 8538347, 9661590, 10523339, 15134813, 17314322) included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached, considering case-level data.\n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by functional studies, expression studies, and animal models. Significant expression of *HSD11B2* in the kidney is demonstrated (PMID: 32913098). Additionally, *HSD11B2* is shown to interact with *NR3C2* (the mineralocorticoid receptor, definitively associated with autosomal dominant pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1). Finally, mouse models with null/knockout of *HSD11B2* are hypertensive with additional biochemical features consistent with AME (PMIDs: 18032795, 28559392). A total of 2/6 pts. for experimental evidence was reached.\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *HSD11B2* and autosomal recessive apparent mineralocorticoid excess. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time.\n\nThis classification was approved by the ClinGen Tubulopathy GCEP on the meeting date May 16, 2024 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e88ed5a8-b773-4bc9-a8c5-4cec122250d7","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a8170a26-6ee5-4acc-bdb2-388097413f3a","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a8170a26-6ee5-4acc-bdb2-388097413f3a_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10067","date":"2024-05-16T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a8170a26-6ee5-4acc-bdb2-388097413f3a_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10067","date":"2024-09-30T21:02:04.512Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a8170a26-6ee5-4acc-bdb2-388097413f3a_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ba8d3316-cd51-4c52-9287-040ee7d350e2_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/07b28db1-19b7-4171-92d8-1b4206053bf7","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Downgrading

In addition, they detected an increase in renal membrane expressions of cleaved epithelial sodium channel-α and T53-phosphorylated Na+ -Cl − cotransporter in the knockout mice. Acute intraperitoneal administration of amiloride-induced natriuresis and increased urinary sodium/potassium ratio more in the knockout mice compared with those in the wild-type control mice. Chronic administration of amiloride and high-KCl diet significantly decreased mean blood pressure in the knockout mice, which was accompanied with the correction of hypokalemia and the resultant decrease in Na+ -Cl − cotransporter phosphorylation. Accordingly, a Na + -Cl − cotransporter blocker hydrochlorothiazide significantly decreased mean blood pressure in the knockout mice. Chronic administration of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist spironolactone significantly decreased mean blood pressure of the knockout mice along with downregulation of cleaved epithelial sodium channel-α and phosphorylated Na + -Cl − cotransporter expression in the knockout kidney. Our data suggest that kidney-specific deficiency of 11β-HSD2 leads to salt-dependent hypertension, which is attributed to mineralocorticoid receptor–epithelial sodium channel–Na + -Cl − cotransporter activation in the kidney, and provides evidence that renal dysfunction is essential for developing the phenotype of apparent mineralocorticoid excess.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28559392","rdfs:label":"Ueda Mouse Model","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a8170a26-6ee5-4acc-bdb2-388097413f3a_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b1fa8fa5-1ceb-4c80-90db-26c25c746904","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/841dfce7-aa6f-42fe-a520-494ad1581a13","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Interaction between HSD11B2 and NR3C2 (the mineralocorticoid receptor, Definitive for AD pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1) is demonstrated using immunofluorescence and coexpression/localization studies.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11350956","rdfs:label":"Interaction with NR3C2","demonstrates":{"id":"obo:MI_0915"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b8940eb4-3c5c-4595-b42b-a783156e669e","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/72e59e63-e120-44a5-b5aa-4e5e5471e9fe","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Significant expression in the kidney, especially in the collecting duct (KIT Humphreys Lab).","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32913098","rdfs:label":"Expression in the kidney","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":9081,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria10","strengthScore":14,"subject":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bWYs5GRFrlM","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0009025","gene":"hgnc:5209","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","websiteLegacyID":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/assertion_a8170a26-6ee5-4acc-bdb2-388097413f3a-","@context":{"@vocab":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"},"curationReasons":{"@type":"@vocab","@container":"@set"},"GCISnapshot":{"@type":"@id"},"dc:isVersionOf":{"@type":"@id"},"websiteLegacyID":{"@type":"@id"}}}
