PET100 was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Leigh syndrome spectrum in 2014 (Lim et al., PMID: 24462369). Two unique variants predicted to cause a loss of or reduced function of the protein have been reported in ClinVar. Complex IV deficiency is the disease mechanism for this gene. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 7 probands with Leigh syndrome spectrum in 1 publication (PMID 24462369). This gene-disease association is further supported by the function of the gene product and studies in patient cell lines. In summary, there is moderate evidence to support the relationship between PET100 and autosomal recessive Leigh syndrome spectrum. This classification was approved by the NICHD U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on May 13, 2019 (SOP Version 6).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/87949afd-0829-4789-bdcb-6390fa20bde5","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/33c546f5-a285-424b-9ae2-9ca4fc718c67","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/33c546f5-a285-424b-9ae2-9ca4fc718c67_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2019-05-20T19:13:47.510Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/33c546f5-a285-424b-9ae2-9ca4fc718c67_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/33c546f5-a285-424b-9ae2-9ca4fc718c67_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/db8817c4-046b-4878-9673-70303c8b01db_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"This is a known founder mutation that is predicted to abolish the translation initiation codon.
