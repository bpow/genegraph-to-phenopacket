The split curation for autosomal recessive congenital heart disease has been curated separately. There are more variants reported in individuals with CHD in 16 publications, all of which were not scored due to a high minor allele frequency (>0.00001) in gnomAD v.4, inheritance from unaffected parents, the variant being a copy number variant containing additional genomic material, the proband having additional variants in genes associated with congenital heart disease, and/or the proband having a syndromic phenotype (PMID: 25713110, 27479907, 28991257, 31453292, 31130284, 30149741, 33131162, 32817298, 33919081, 32368696, 34328347, 36308391, 34983622, 35885997, 37035742, 36568277).

In summary, there is limited evidence supporting the relationship between *PRKD1* and autosomal dominant congenital heart disease.
