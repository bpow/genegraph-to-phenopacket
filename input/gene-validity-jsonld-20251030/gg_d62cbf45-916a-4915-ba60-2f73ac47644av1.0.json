Coffin-Siris syndrome is a rare congenital disorder characterized by delayed psychomotor development, intellectual disability, coarse facial features, and hypoplasia of the distal phalanges, particularly the fifth digit. Other features may also be observed, including congenital heart defects, hypoplasia of the corpus callosum, and poor overall growth with short stature and microcephaly (PMID: 23906836). Of note, variants in *SMARCE1* have also been reported in autosomal dominant familial meningioma; this gene disease-relationship has been curated separately.\n\nSeven variants (6 missense and 1 splice variant leading to an in-frame deletion) reported in 13 probands in 11 publications (PMIDs: 22426308, 23906836, 23929686, 27264197, 30499906, 30548424, 31273213, 31530938, 31675646, 32732226, 37853563) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. Most reported variants occur *de novo*. Several variants are recurrent (including p.Tyr73Ser, p.Tyr73Cys and p.Arg105Gln), and most cluster within the HMG domain of the SMARCE1 protein. The fact that all reported variants are either missense or in-frame deletions is consistent with a gain-of-function or dominant-negative effect, but no functional studies have been performed.\n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence, including biochemical function and protein interactions. Several other members of the SWI/SNF complex have been involved in Coffin-Siris syndrome, including *SMARCA4*, *SMARCB1*, *SMARCC2*, *SMARCD1*, *DPF2*, *ARID1A*, *ARID1B*, *ARID2* and *BICRA*. Variants in *SMARCA2*, another member of the SWI/SNF complex, cause a related disorder, Nicolaides-Baraitser syndrome.\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *SMARCE1* and autosomal dominant Coffin-Siris syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism Gene Curation Expert Panels on September 18, 2024 (SOP Version 11).\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d62cbf45-916a-4915-ba60-2f73ac47644a","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/877f5e0f-5b30-4a4f-87c3-cb6b87caa1e4","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/877f5e0f-5b30-4a4f-87c3-cb6b87caa1e4_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2024-09-18T19:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/877f5e0f-5b30-4a4f-87c3-cb6b87caa1e4_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2025-06-17T19:59:47.051Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/877f5e0f-5b30-4a4f-87c3-cb6b87caa1e4_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a599f4ab-8c60-4dc1-9600-53c0ce9e4e1f","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a599f4ab-8c60-4dc1-9600-53c0ce9e4e1f_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32732226","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a06e50f8-6e0f-437b-a809-4d013eb1abf1","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_003079.5(SMARCE1):c.276G>C
