TP63-related ectodermal dysplasia spectrum with limb and orofacial malformations is characterized by variable ectodermal dysplasia, limb defects, and orofacial clefting. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in inheritance pattern and phenotypic variability. Therefore, the following disease entities, EEC3 syndrome (MIM:604292), ADULT syndrome (MIM:103285), AEC syndrome (MIM:106260), Rapp-Hodgkin syndrome (MIM:129400), Limb-mammary syndrome (MIM:603543), Split-hand/foot malformation 4 (MIM:605289), and Orofacial cleft 8 (MIM:618149), have been lumped into one disease entity, TP63-related ectodermal dysplasia spectrum with limb and orofacial malformations. However, Premature ovarian failure 21 (MIM:620311) was split out due to phenotypic differences and will be curated by a different GCEP.\n\n21 variants (16 missense, 4 frameshift, and 1 nonsense) that have been reported in 21 probands in 9 publications (PMIDs: 10535733, 11159940, 11462173, 20491771, 21204238, 22574117, 29500247, 33622322, 37920856) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity at this time is unknown. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by animal models, functional alteration, protein-protein interactions, and expression studies (PMIDs: 10227294, 22247000, 19353588, 20855944, 21965674). In summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between TP63 and AD TP63-related ectodermal dysplasia spectrum with limb and orofacial malformations. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.This classification was approved by the ClinGen Craniofacial Malformation GCEP on the meeting date October 17th, 2024 (SOP Version 11).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e506f950-3eb9-4280-b47a-deadb5ca08a2","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1b929e5b-2ce9-44b5-8c30-7290c2d8e490","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1b929e5b-2ce9-44b5-8c30-7290c2d8e490_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10059","date":"2025-01-17T17:59:41.738Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1b929e5b-2ce9-44b5-8c30-7290c2d8e490_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10059","date":"2024-10-17T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1b929e5b-2ce9-44b5-8c30-7290c2d8e490_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1b929e5b-2ce9-44b5-8c30-7290c2d8e490_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/de15067e-52a7-43a4-9cee-e8172f77b810","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/56f1f054-4e00-4b84-a704-1cc6ea17588f","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Like the human phenotype, the mouse model showed ectodermal dysplasia and craniofacial malformations, including tooth abnormalities and cleft palate.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22247000","rdfs:label":"Ferone_Mouse model","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7bb45687-da16-4cea-a72f-ea2af91511ae","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a41b266e-d343-447a-ae5c-9833898737e3","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Like the human phenotype, TP63 null mice showed ectodermal dysplasia, limb abnormalities, and craniofacial malformations","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10227294","rdfs:label":"Yang_Mouse Model","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1b929e5b-2ce9-44b5-8c30-7290c2d8e490_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d6ddfc26-74d0-4acc-b22f-bd4fe9834fdc","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a6f420af-0c59-4ac9-86ec-88ad119de99f","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"PERP is TP63 target gene shown to play a fundamental role in the integrity of stratified epithelia. PERP membrane staining was dramatically diminished in the basal and suprabasal layers of the skin while remaining intact in the uppermost layers. This pattern is consistent with disrupted TP63 action, as TP63 is localized to the more basal layers of the epidermis in AEC patients, and suggests that some other factor regulates PERP in the upper layers of the epidermis.
