Variants in GATM were first reported in humans with this disorder in 2001 (Item et al, PMID 11555793) in two sisters previously reported with creatine deficiency in the brain (Bianchi et al, 2000; PMID 10762163). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data. At least 7 unique variants (missense, nonsense, frameshift, and splice site) have been reported in 6 probands in 5 publications (Edvardson et al, 2010, PMID 20682460; Verma et al, 2010, PMID 20625172; Ndika et al, 2012, PMID 22386973; Nouioua et al, 2013, PMID 23770102; Stockler-Ipsiroglu et al, 2015, PMID 26490222). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 3 additional family members in one large family (Battini et al, 2002, PMID 12468279). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence and/or experimental evidence (12 points) has been reached. The mechanism for disease is biallelic loss of function. This gene-disease relationship is supported by the biochemical function of AGAT, catalyzing the first step of creatine synthesis, functional analysis of missense variants (Des Roches et al, 2016, PMID 27233232), and the biochemical features and clinical features of a null mouse model (Choe et al, 2013, PMID 23026748; Nabuurs et al, 2015, PMID 23129796; Iqbal et al, PMID 28808834). In summary, GATM is definitively associated with AGAT deficiency. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. Of note, this gene has also been implicated in renal Fanconi syndrome and kidney failure. That gene-disease relationship will be assessed separately.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/19e0c046-9e92-4dd7-80bc-c0335da66f9b","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d63bfeff-882d-400f-af17-277a702fd09b","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d63bfeff-882d-400f-af17-277a702fd09b_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10011","date":"2020-09-16T19:23:02.864Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d63bfeff-882d-400f-af17-277a702fd09b_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10011","date":"2019-03-08T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d63bfeff-882d-400f-af17-277a702fd09b_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4eac7c90-f045-44c1-9da6-1fa5fee1c087_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"This individual is homozygous for a missense variant, p.Ala185Pro.

This is the second and final step of creatine synthesis. Based on previous studies, it was known that the last step of creatine biosynthesis involves the methylation of guanidinoacetate. It was also known that the methyl group in creatine is derived from L-methionine, and that ATP and Mg++ are required. A soluble enzyme catalyzing S-adenosylmethionine + guanidinoacetate -> S-adenosylhomocysteine + creatine was found in cell-free extracts of guinea pig, rabbit, beef, and pig liver. The enzyme from pig liver was purified, approximately 20-fold. Using this partially purified enzyme, a linear relationship was observed between the formation of creatine from S-adenosylmethionine + guanidinoacetate, and the amount of the enzyme. Creatine was conclusively identified as one of the products of the enzymatic reaction by determination of its chemical nature, the ability of the reaction product to function as a substrate for creatine kinase, and the finding of creatinine (a breakdown product of creatine) in the reaction.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/13192118","rdfs:label":"Creatine synthesis pathway","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionA"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d63bfeff-882d-400f-af17-277a702fd09b_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b019e98a-03bb-4378-92da-9535ece6389e","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Missense variants in GATM can result in lack of production of guanidinoacetate, as found in patients with AGAT deficiency.","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1d1e7ccd-978e-4b5a-80da-cf1d9ce82fae","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Seven missense variants from the EVS, c.314C>T (p.Pro105Leu), c.541G>A (p.Glu181Lys), c.565C>T (p.Arg189Cys), c.622G>A (p.Ala208Thr), c.845G>A (p.Arg282His), c.985C>G (p.
