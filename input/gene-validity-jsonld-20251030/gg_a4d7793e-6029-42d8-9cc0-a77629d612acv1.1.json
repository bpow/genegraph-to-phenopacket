Disease-causing *BEST1* mutations are also associated with autosomal dominant vitreoretinochoroidopathy (ADVIRC) and autosomal recessive bestrophinopathy (ARB). Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping & Splitting Working Group, the phenotype of cases diagnosed with vitelliform macular dytrophy or other forms of BEST1-related dominant retinopathy has been found to represent a distinct disease entity from cases diagnosed with vitreoretinochoroidopathy (AD) or  bestrophinopathy (AR). Therefore, this curation has focused on BEST1-related dominant retinopathy, while the gene will undergo separate curations for BEST1-related vitreoretinochoroidopathy and BEST1-related recessive retinopathy.\n\nThis curation has included twenty variants (17 missense, 1 in-frame deletion, 1 nonsense and 1 frameshift) that have been reported in twenty probands in nine publications (PMIDs: 10331951, 16754206, 9700209, 10617923, 14517959, 27193166, 10854112, 25082885, 31836750). Segregation data have also been scored from three families showing co-segregation of *BEST1* with BVMD (PMID: 10617923, PMID: 9700209, PMID: 16754206). The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be dominant negative, primarily through mislocalization of the BEST1 protein and a reduction in anion conductance in the RPE.\n\nThis gene-disease association is also supported by experimental evidence that *BEST1* mRNA and BEST1 protein expression are restricted to the RPE layer of the retina (PMID: 9700209 and PMID: 29022597). Two functional alteration experiments, one conducted in patient cells and one conducted in HEK-293 cells, show that *BEST1* mutations result in mislocalization of the mature protein in the cell and strongly reduced anion permeability (PMID: 21878505, PMID: 32111077). A *BEST1* (+/W93C) knock-in mouse model was shown to recapitulate many of the features of BVMD seen in human patients, including an abnormal LP luminance-response function, accumulation of lipofuscin in RPE cells, and the formation of fluid- and debris-filled retinal detachments (PMID: 20053664).\n\nIn summary, *BEST1* is definitively associated with BEST1-related dominant retinopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time without the emergence of contradictory evidence. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Retina GCEP on August 3rd, 2023 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a4d7793e-6029-42d8-9cc0-a77629d612ac","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/487a42cc-7dd0-4991-ac9d-1346f59073c0","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":{"id":"cg:sopChange"},"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/487a42cc-7dd0-4991-ac9d-1346f59073c0_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10072","date":"2023-08-03T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/487a42cc-7dd0-4991-ac9d-1346f59073c0_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10072","date":"2024-06-29T04:36:52.756Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration","DiseaseNameUpdate"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/487a42cc-7dd0-4991-ac9d-1346f59073c0_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a34c0b53-90fa-49e5-b86f-f4c6b2ec4a98","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"\nRetina GCEP agreed to score these functionally-validated missense variants at 1 point for each proband.\n","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a34c0b53-90fa-49e5-b86f-f4c6b2ec4a98_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10854112","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/526a1989-374d-4c2f-81cb-bed109730af3","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_004183.4(BEST1):c.670C>A (p.Leu224Met)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA227802"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Heterozygous"}},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a34c0b53-90fa-49e5-b86f-f4c6b2ec4a98_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"PMID: 21878505\nAs a general theme, we found that the mutants analyzed either failed to traffic to the cell membrane or showed reduced efficiency to incorporate into the cell membrane, with exception of mutation R218C, which was targeted to the plasma membrane in a manner similar to the wild type protein. A refined colocalization analysis with various subcellular markers revealed that the mutants L21V, R92S, L224M and F305S were partially retained in the Golgi complex, the endoplasmic reticulum and in the early endosomes. This suggests that mutant bestrophin-1 proteins are synthesized in the ER and move to the Golgi complex where they fail to undergo further processing. To further investigate the properties of the disease-associated bestrophin-1 mutations, anion conductance was measured by halide-sensitive YFP I152L assays in transfected HEK-293 cells.

This suggests that mutant bestrophin-1 proteins are synthesized in the ER and move to the Golgi complex where they fail to undergo further processing. To further investigate the properties of the disease-associated bestrophin-1 mutations, anion conductance was measured by halide-sensitive YFP I152L assays in transfected HEK-293 cells. As a main observation we found that all mutant bestrophin-1 led to a strongly reduced increase in Ca2+-dependent anion permeability; the observed I– quenches were significantly smaller than those seen with wild-type bestrophin-1.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21878505","rdfs:label":"Milenkovic_FunctionalAlteration"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/487a42cc-7dd0-4991-ac9d-1346f59073c0_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/322ad335-6e06-4e94-9498-0059197fff66","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Increased score due to multiple rescue methods (BV and AAV) and inclusion of HEK-293 and  subcellular localization experiments demonstrating functional impact of mutations. \n","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6a4afcb0-a07e-49d0-9769-890bdd0eb9c2","type":"Finding","dc:description":"BV: Ca2+-dependent Cl− current measured at 1.2 μM [Ca2+]i by whole-cell patch clamp significantly increased from 24 to 48 hours, and in a dose-dependent manner at 48 hours post infection (Fig. 5b–e). A complete rescue of the Cl− current at peak [Ca2+]i was observed at 48 hours post infection with a minimum MOI of 100 (Fig. 5c–e, and Supplementary Fig. S5),\nwhere Ca2+-dependent Cl− currents in a full range of [Ca2+]is were also fully restored (Fig. 5d). Consistently, Ca2+-dependent Cl− currents in the other five patient-derived iPSC-RPEs were all rescued to a similar level under the same conditions (Fig. 5f–k), regardless of the type or level of deficiency in the endogenous BEST1 function. Immunoblotting results showed that the exogenous BEST1 expression level is comparable to that of the endogenous\nBEST1 (Supplementary Fig. S4).
