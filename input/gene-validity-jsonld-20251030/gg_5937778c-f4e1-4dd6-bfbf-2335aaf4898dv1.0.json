{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5937778c-f4e1-4dd6-bfbf-2335aaf4898dv1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"The relationship between *MT-RNR2* and primary mitochondrial disease was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of December 5, 2022. The *MT-RNR2* gene encodes the large 16S mitochondrial ribosomal RNA (rRNA).  \n\n*MT-RNR2* was first reported in relation to maternally-inherited primary mitochondrial disease in 2001 in a family with maternally-inherited mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) syndrome, but who also carried the well-known pathogenic m.3243A>G variant precluding this case from being included in this gene curation (PMID: 11455195). While various names could be given to the constellation of features seen in those with *MT-RNR2*-related disease, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *MT-RNR2* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework.\n\nEvidence supporting the gene-disease relationship between *MT-RNR2* and primary mitochondrial disease includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation includes two variants (m.3090G>A and m.2336T>C) in two publications, with phenotypes of progressive myopathy, exercise intolerance, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (PMIDs: 17761147, 24367055). Mitochondrial respiratory chain enzyme analysis in these individuals showed complex I and IV deficiency (PMID: 17761147). Labs showed elevated blood lactate. In one individual, heteroplasmy levels were found to be almost homoplasmic in muscle, 50% in urine, and undetectable in fibroblasts, hair follicles, and blood (PMID: 17761147). In the second individual, the variant was present at homoplasmy in blood, urine, hair follicles, and oral epithelium (PMID: 24367055).  Cybrid studies further support variant pathogenicity for case-level scoring (PMID: 24367055). This gene-disease relationship is also supported by known biochemical function and functional alteration in patient cells demonstrating cellular and electrophysiological abnormalities (PMID: 29456182).    \n\nIn summary, there is limited evidence to support the relationship between *MT-RNR2* and maternally-inherited primary mitochondrial disease. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts this gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on December 5, 2022 (SOP Version 9).
