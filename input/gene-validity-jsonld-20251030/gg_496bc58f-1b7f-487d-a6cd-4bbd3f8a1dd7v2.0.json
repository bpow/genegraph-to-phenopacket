TRIM63 was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in 2012 (Chen et al, 2012, PMID 22821932) and has been reported in no subsequent clinical reports, though evidence for autosomal recessive disease is emerging. The split curation for autosomal recessive inheritance has been curated separately. Chen et al. reported 3 variants in 5 probands, including 2 missense variants in 3 probands, and one truncating variant (p.Q247X) in 2 probands without segregation. The p.Q247X variant has an allele frequency of 0.0007 (0.008 in the Ashkenazi Jewish population), considered too high for AD inheritance. All 3 variants have limited functional evidence for disease causation. A case control study utilizing aggregate variant analysis reported rare variants in TRIM63 at a higher frequency in cases compared to controls (Su et al, 2014, PMID 24865491). A second case control study (Walsh et al, 2017, PMID 27532257) found no enrichment of rare variants in cases vs. controls. Notably, multiple reports of AR inheritance have demonstrated no disease in heterozygote relatives (Olive et al, 2015, PMID 25801283, Andreeva et al, 2022, PMID 35273634, Salazar-Mendiguchia et al, 2020, PMID 32451364). This gene-disease association is supported by expression studies (Bodine et al, 2001, PMID 11679633; Fagerberg et al, 2014, PMID 24309898), protein interaction with TNNI3, MYBPC3, TNNT2, and MYH7 (Kedar et al, 2004, PMID 15601779, Mearini et al, 2010, PMID 19850579, Witt et al, 2005, PMID 15967462, Fielitz et al, 2007, PMID 17786241), and biochemical function (Kedar et al, 2004, PMID 15601779, Mearini et al, 2010, PMID 19850579, Arya et al, 2004, PMID 15596539). The original curation was published on December 20th, 2016 with a classification of Limited. At the time of this re-curation, no new genetic level evidence has emerged to support the disease mode of inheritance. In summary, the evidence supporting the relationship between TRIM63 and autosomal dominant HCM has been disputed, and no valid evidence remains to support the claim. More evidence is needed to either support or entirely refute the role TRIM63 plays in this disease. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Gene Curation Expert Panel on October 27th, 2022.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/496bc58f-1b7f-487d-a6cd-4bbd3f8a1dd7","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d9f35d3c-2d30-4947-9d10-87d21405586e","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","changes":[{"id":"cg:expertPanelChange"},{"id":"cg:sopChange"},{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},{"id":"cg:newEvidence"},{"id":"cg:classificationChange"},{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d9f35d3c-2d30-4947-9d10-87d21405586e_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10104","date":"2023-02-02T13:25:46.110Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d9f35d3c-2d30-4947-9d10-87d21405586e_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10104","date":"2022-10-27T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"Move to change classification from Limited to Disputed due to the lack of replication over time and the emergence of evidence that disputes the suggested mode of inheritance.
