{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f23bc792-7b6b-4735-9e8c-3f6fdd3216c4v1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"Variants in CRADD were initially reported in relation to autosomal recessive non-syndromic intellectual disability in 2012 in a Mennonite family with five individuals with developmental delay and intellectual disability (PMID: 22279524). Later, in 2016, variants in this gene were observed in individuals with lissencephaly and megalencephaly; this publication also reports MRI findings from the original Mennonite family reported in 2012, demonstrating that they also had lissencephaly (PMID: 27773430). Given the findings of developmental delay, intellectual disability, and lissencephaly, we chose to curate this gene for its relationship with autosomal recessive syndromic intellectual disability. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level, segregation, and experimental data. Biallelic frameshift, missense, and start-loss variants in CRADD have been reported in at least 47 probands in 6 publications (PMIDs: 22279524, 27773430, 28686357, 30167849, 33647455, 30914828); loss of function is the purported disease mechanism (PMIDs: 27773430, 28686357). Two founder variants have been identified in Mennonite and Finnish populations (PMIDs: 22279524, 27773430, 30914828). This gene-disease relationship is further supported by in vitro functional assays and a mouse model (PMID: 27773430). In summary, ​CRADD​​ is definitively associated with ​autosomal recessive syndromic intellectual disability. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel on ​06/16/2021 (SOP Version 8). \n\nPlease note that while the genetic evidence score is tallied at 15 points, it should actually be 16 points to reflect scoring recommendations for autosomal recessive missense variants described in SOP version 8; at the time of this curation, the Gene Curation Interface was unable to accurately reflect these upgrades.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f23bc792-7b6b-4735-9e8c-3f6fdd3216c4","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7f64ee7f-13a7-4a2d-b1a2-ad6c9e63cab3","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7f64ee7f-13a7-4a2d-b1a2-ad6c9e63cab3_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2021-07-28T20:39:52.603Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7f64ee7f-13a7-4a2d-b1a2-ad6c9e63cab3_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2021-06-16T18:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7f64ee7f-13a7-4a2d-b1a2-ad6c9e63cab3_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e20f7ea2-3b96-4671-9d0a-2a4e2b4ed94d_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Using SOP v.8, the default score for variants that are proven/predicted null is 1.5 points.
