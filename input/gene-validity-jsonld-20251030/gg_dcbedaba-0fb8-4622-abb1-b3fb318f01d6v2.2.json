{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/dcbedaba-0fb8-4622-abb1-b3fb318f01d6v2.2","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"*GMPPB* was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive myopathy caused by variation in *GMPPB* (muscular dystrophy-dystroglycanopathy included) in 2013, characterizing several patients with a highly variable phenotype (Carss et al., PMID: 23768512). The most severely affected patient had severe developmental delays, retinal dysfunction, and cerebellar hypoplasia reminiscent of muscle-eye-brain disease. Four patients presented with a milder phenotype with intellectual disability and variable cerebellar hypoplasia, and three patients had no developmental phenotypes and a pattern of muscle weakness/dystrophy consistent with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy. All patients showed reduced glycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan, suggesting a dystroglycanopathy. This gene was also asserted in relation to congenital myasthenic syndrome in 2015 (Belaya et al., PMID: 26133662), however a review of the phenotypes, molecular mechanism, and published assertions demonstrated that the disorders should be considered part of the same spectrum and thus assessed together. Over 50 variants (e.g. missense, in-frame indel, nonsense, frameshift, etc.) have been reported in humans since these initial reports. The most frequent variant is the c.79G>C (p.Asp27His) founder variant, with others being c.859C>T (p.Arg287Trp) and c.860G>A (p.Arg287Gln) (Sun et al. 2020, PMID: 30684953). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data.\n \nSummary of Case Level Data (12 Points): Variants in this gene have been reported in over 80 probands and at least 13 different publications, with four of those being evaluated in this curation (PMIDs: 23768512, 25770200, 27766311, 29437916). No strongly supportive segregation evidence was characterized among these publications. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism for disease is biallelic loss of function, with the loss or alteration of the GDP-mannose pyrophosphorylase B protein causing a dysfunctional early step in the N-glycosylation, O-mannosylation, and C-mannosylation pathways which includes alpha-dystroglycan (Rodriguez Cruz et al. 2016, PMID: 27147698). Although the congenital myasthenic syndrome probands show some additional neuromuscular phenotypes, it is likely that this is caused by disruption of other neuromuscular junction proteins' glycosylation.\n \nSummary of Experimental Data (2.5 Points): This gene-disease association is supported by several pieces of experimental evidence. As shown, *GMPPB* is known to have a critical role in the glycosylation pathway of alpha-dystroglycan which can have variably severe developmental consequences when disrupted. RT-PCR of human fetal and adult RNA tissues confirmed that the predominant isoform of *GMPPB* is strongly expressed in all tissues, particularly the skeletal muscle and brain. A zebrafish knockdown via a splice-blocking morpholino showed a variety of muscular and cranial phenotypes such as bent tails, altered skeletal muscle fibers, ocular phenotypes, slow movement, and reduced glycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan (Carss et al. 2013, PMID: 23768512).\n \nIn summary, *GMPPB* is definitively associated with autosomal recessive myopathy caused by variation in *GMPPB*. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/dcbedaba-0fb8-4622-abb1-b3fb318f01d6","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/44d2e0f3-d2c4-4879-8bc8-2f3bdd4cfac5","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":{"id":"cg:expertPanelChange"},"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/44d2e0f3-d2c4-4879-8bc8-2f3bdd4cfac5_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10151","date":"2024-08-13T19:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/44d2e0f3-d2c4-4879-8bc8-2f3bdd4cfac5_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10151","date":"2024-08-13T14:19:00.722Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["ErrorClarification"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/44d2e0f3-d2c4-4879-8bc8-2f3bdd4cfac5_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/44d2e0f3-d2c4-4879-8bc8-2f3bdd4cfac5_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a4457d36-259c-4935-8e3e-447fa038f00d","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Due to the strong ubiquitous expression of GMPPB, including all areas with significant phenotypes, this evidence scores default points.","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e2014214-4acf-477a-b94e-4eb778c0739c","type":"Finding","dc:description":"RT-PCR was performed of human fetal and adult RNA from various tissues.
