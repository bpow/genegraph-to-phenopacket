Variants in TH were first reported in humans with this disorder in 1995 (Lüdecke et al, PMID 7814018). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Fourteen unique variants were curated (missense, nonsense, frameshift, intronic, and promoter) in 15 probands from 14 publications (Lüdecke et al, 1995, PMID 7814018; van den Heuvel et al, 1998, PMID 9703425; Janssen et al, 2000, PMID 11281275; Swaans et al, 2000, PMID 11246459; Furukawa et al, 2001, PMID 11160968; Hoffmann et al, 2003, PMID 12891655; Ribasés et al, 2007, PMID 17698383; Verbeek et al, 207, PMID 17696123; Pons et al, 2010, PMID 20198643; Ormazabal et al, 2011, PMID 21465550; Chi et al, 2012, PMID 22264700; Goswami et al, 2017, PMID 28667724; Katus et al, 2017, PMID 29225908; Feng et al, 2018, PMID 30383639). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. The mechanism for disease is biallelic loss of function. This gene-disease relationship is supported by the biochemical function of TH, which catalyzes the conversion of L-tyrosine to L-dopa (Nagatsu et al, 1964, PMID 5836553), functional studies (Fossbakk et al, 2014, PMID 24753243) and the biochemical features and clinical features of mouse models (Kobayashi et al, 1995, PMID 7592982; Korner et al, 2015, PMID 26276013). In summary, TH is definitively associated with TH deficiency. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Aminoacidopathy Gene Curation Expert Panel. This curation includes data collected by Counsyl.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c6d109b0-c5f9-4724-b13a-119636ea0ea8","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c4bf9fbb-0046-4a90-9e74-0b3b79f28f59","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"},"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c4bf9fbb-0046-4a90-9e74-0b3b79f28f59_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10011","date":"2019-03-22T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c4bf9fbb-0046-4a90-9e74-0b3b79f28f59_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10011","date":"2020-09-16T19:23:02.882Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c4bf9fbb-0046-4a90-9e74-0b3b79f28f59_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/51e0debf-5926-40e1-865a-8e4fea170262_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Score reduced due to lack of biochemical testing information such as CSF HVA level or ruling out GCH1 deficiency.

Mice homozygous for the TH mutation and with multiple copies of the human TH transgene were viable at 3 weeks of age and remained healthy until at least 5-6 months of age. TH activity was similar in wild type and transgenic mice. The catecholamine levels in the tissues of the rescued mutants were similar to those in the wild-type mice at adulthood (data not shown).","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7592982","rdfs:label":"Rescue in TH knock out mice","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:PhenotypeRescue"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanRescueCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7646693d-8917-4670-a8ef-99c506d3bbb4","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The mice mimic the features of humans cases on a molecular level (homozygous for an equivalent variant identified in human patients), neurotransmitter levels, and clinical features.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/60398412-d2b0-4a20-a6d3-0b6a68a0b1c6","type":"Finding","dc:description":"The biochemical features of mice homozygous for a knock in missense variant, that corresponds to a human TH variant (p.Arg244His), mimic the findings in human patients with TH deficiency including low homovaniliic acid (HVA), normal 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid (5-HIAA), reduced HVA:5-HIAA ratio, and normal neopterin, biopterin, and serotonin. As in human patients, prolactin is increased in knock in mice, reflecting central dopamine deficiency (dopamine inhibits prolactin release from the pituitary gland). The clinical features of these mice recapitulate many of the features in human including rigidity, dystonia, impaired motor coordinator, hypokinesis, and abnormal gait. Furthermore, these features exhibited a diurnal fluctuation in mice, as is often observed in humans. While the symptoms in mice did not repsond to L-Dopa treatment, the authors note that poor responsiveness to L-DOPA is not unusual for patients with this variant. In addition, homozygous mice exhibited low body weight and hypotension, and these features have been reported in human patients.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26276013","rdfs:label":"TH knock in mice","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":3}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":3.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":6}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":807,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria6","strengthScore":18,"subject":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/yplFm6MjeW0","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0100064","gene":"hgnc:11782","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.1","websiteLegacyID":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/assertion_c4bf9fbb-0046-4a90-9e74-0b3b79f28f59-","@context":{"@vocab":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"},"curationReasons":{"@type":"@vocab","@container":"@set"},"GCISnapshot":{"@type":"@id"},"dc:isVersionOf":{"@type":"@id"},"websiteLegacyID":{"@type":"@id"}}}
