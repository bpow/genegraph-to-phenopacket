Choroideremia (CHM) is an X-linked disorder characterized by progressive degeneration of the photoreceptors, retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and underlying choroid.  Affected males present with progressive retinal degeneration leading to night blindness in childhood or teens, develop loss of peripheral vision, and have complete loss of vision by middle age. Heterozygous females are usually asymptomatic, but characteristic areas of chorioretinal degeneration can be observed, most likely representing clonal areas of disease due to random X inactivation (Mosajee et al, 2014, PMID 23963298; MacDonald et al, 2015, PMID 20301511; Dimopoulos et al, 2017, PMID 28520608). \n The CHM gene product, known as the Rab Escort Protein 1 (REP1), is involved in the lipid modification (prenylation) of Rab GTPases, a process which is essential for the role of Rab GTPases in intracellular vesicular transport (Mitsios et al, 2018, PMID 30627697).\nRearrangements in this gene, including deletions and translocations, were first reported in 1990 (Cremers et al, PMID: 2215697), and single nucleotide variants were first published in 1992 (van den Hurk et al, PMID 1598901). Since then, over 300 variants in CHM have been identified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic for choroideremia (https://databases.lovd.nl/shared/variants/CHM/unique). The majority of variants are loss of function, such as nonsense, frameshift, and canonical splice site variants. However, a few missense variants have been reported (Dimopoulos et al, 2017, PMID 28520608). \nIn this curation, data from 18 probands (17 male and 1 female) with unique variants were collected (nonsense, frameshift, splice site, initiator codon, missense) (Van den Hurk et al, 1992, PMID 1598901; Bozbeyoglu et al, 2007, PMID 25390790; Esposito et al, 2011, PMID  21905166; Torriano et al, 2017, PMID 28911202). More data is available in the literature but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached.\nThis gene-disease relationship is supported by the biochemical function of REP1 (Mitsios et al, 2018, PMID 30627697), functional alteration studies in monocytes and fibroblasts (Seabra et al, 1995, PMID 7592656; Strunnikova et al, 2009, PMID 20027300), zebrafish and mouse models (Krock et al, 2007, PMID 17360570; Tolmachova et al, 2010, PMID 20445111), and the results of gene therapy trials (MacLaren et al, 2014, PMID 24439297).\nMore experimental data to support this gene-disease relationship is available in the literature.\nIn summary, CHM is definitively associated with choroideremia. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This clinical validity classification was approved by the ClinGen Retina Gene Curation Expert Panel.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/53f6e25f-58b8-4648-9f44-21892b78c8bb","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d84b01d6-8b3c-4a1e-bd25-68ee6962f374","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d84b01d6-8b3c-4a1e-bd25-68ee6962f374_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10072","date":"2020-10-26T12:47:04.094Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d84b01d6-8b3c-4a1e-bd25-68ee6962f374_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10072","date":"2020-10-26T12:47:19.988Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d84b01d6-8b3c-4a1e-bd25-68ee6962f374_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d84b01d6-8b3c-4a1e-bd25-68ee6962f374_seg_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/65753e1f-1e39-47c5-9e5c-c8568366e1eb_proband_segregation","type":"FamilyCosegregation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28911202","rdfs:label":"CHM6","family":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/65753e1f-1e39-47c5-9e5c-c8568366e1eb","type":"Family","rdfs:label":"CHM6","ethnicity":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/"},"member":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/035ad3c8-cfcc-48dd-99f9-a92e962e9457","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28911202","rdfs:label":"CHM6, III-9","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/","ageValue":37,"detectionMethod":"\"Sequence analysis of all the CHM exons\".

Fundus examination showed typical chorioretinal atrophy, with absence of autofluorescence, in the retinal periphery and spots of pigment deposits (Fig. 1B). A narrowed central islet of preserved retina was present in each eye (Fig. 1C). On an optical coherence tomography (OCT) scan, the ellipsoid zone and outer nuclear layer were absent in the regions where the choroid was atrophic. Typical tubulations and interlaminar bridges were noted. The visual field showed a central vision on 10–12 degrees, a large infero-temporal remnant of vision between 50–80 degrees, and a few spots of vision in the superior visual field. The full field scotopic ERG was virtually undetectable, photopic responses were 15–20% of the normal amplitude.","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0000533","obo:HP_0000662","obo:HP_0000512"],"previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"No details provided.","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/be98f367-44d3-42d8-9b6d-69e4c763d886_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28911202","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/aed42b7e-b6c9-4969-89fe-0a3f0f0ab6e8","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000390.4(CHM):c.1370T>C (p.Leu457Pro)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA413789380"}}}}},"phenotypeFreeText":"","phenotypePositiveAllelePositive":2,"phenotypes":["obo:HP_0000662","obo:HP_0000533","obo:HP_0000512"],"proband":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/035ad3c8-cfcc-48dd-99f9-a92e962e9457"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValiditySegregationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d84b01d6-8b3c-4a1e-bd25-68ee6962f374_ad_other_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ace9fec9-0eac-47a0-bcdc-f5aa673290b2_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"This male with clinical diagnosis of choroideremia has a missense variant, p.His507Arg, in CHM.

Rab proteins must be prenylated, which involves the inclusion of geranyl-geranyl group, in order to bind to lipid membranes and mediate transportation. In the first step of prenylation, the geranyl–geranyl transferase 2 enzyme (GGTase2) and REP1 bind to Rab proteins is the first crucial step.29 The prenylated Rab protein is then escorted by REP1 and delivered to the target intracellular compartment (see Figure 1 for review). Another rab escort protein, REP2, has been identified which is 75% homologous to REP1, and may compensate for loss of REP1 in body tissues, except for retina, in patents with choroideremia.

When compared to controls (n=5), they found that BRV-transformed lymphocytes from CHM patients (n=4; all male with reduced or absent CHM mRNA in lymphocytes) efficiently prenylate the majority of its Rab proteins, except for Ram/Rab27. There was a 2-3 times higher apparent Km in the in vitro prenylation of Ram/Rab27 when REP-2 was present as compared to REP-1. This suggested a lower affinity of REP-2 for Ram/Rab27 compared to REP-1 for Ram/Rab27, and therefore indicated a mechanism for deficient prenylation in CHM cells. The effect of deficient prenylation of Ram/Rab27 in CHM cells was demonstrated in immunolocalization studies showing that in normal lymphoblasts the protein is mostly membrane bound, but in CHM cells Ram/Rab27 is predominantly cytosolic.\n\n\nFrom Western blot and immunolocalization studies, Ram/Rab27 is expressed at high levels in the retinal pigment epithelium and choriocapillaris, the two sites of earliest degeneration in CHM, but not significantly expressed in photoreceptors. The authors propose a mechanism for the retinal degeneration in CHM. Ram/Rab27 is thought to play role in the regulation of a specific vesicular transport step in RPE and/or choriocapillaris cells. The inability to efficiently prenylate Ram/Rab27 in these cells leads to a functional defect that ultimately results in cellular death.

Phagocytosis in primary fibroblasts was tracked and quantified using collagen I coated FluoSpheres beads. The rate of uptake was significantly lower in fibroblasts from CHM patients compared to controls 1 h following feeding but then continued at a similar rate to controls, however the number of cells taking up particles was consistently less in primary cultures of CHM patients.
