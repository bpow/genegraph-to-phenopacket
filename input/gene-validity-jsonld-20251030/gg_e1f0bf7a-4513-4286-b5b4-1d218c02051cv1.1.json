The disease mechanism is loss of function. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes genetic evidence (case-level data) and experimental evidence (biochemical functions, protein interaction and animal model).\n\nSummary of Case Level Data: 4.4 points: Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 5 probands in 3 publications (PMIDs: 29191945, 24085763, 28559357). Five additional individuals from two publications (PMIDs: 28466964, 32150607) have been noted to have monoallelic loss of function variants. These individuals have been added to this gene-disease record, but not scored. The H/T GCEP is aware that there is published (5 cases) and unpublished (at least one individual with heterozygous nonsense variant, along with GFI1b C168F variant) evidence to suggest that there may be a semi-dominant mode of inheritance for the thrombocytopneia phenotype caused by *THPO* variants as heterozygous carrier relatives of probands with homozygous alterations also display reduced platelet counts (PMIDs: 24085763, 29191945); however, there has not been overwhelming evidence at this time to confirm that *THPO*-associated thrombocytopenia is indeed inherited in a semi-dominant manner. \n\nSummary of Experimental Data: 3.5 points: This gene-disease relationship is supported by in vitro functional assays. *THPO* is involved in megakaryopoiesis and thrombopoiesis, and loss of function variants in *THPO* lead to decrease in platelet counts (PMID: 23594368). Chen et al. showed that *THPO* physically interacts with MPL. (PMID: 20529857). A knock-out mouse model was generated by Sauvage et al, wherein homozygous KO mice recapitulated the thrombocytopenia phenotype while the heterozygous mice showed a significant reduction in platelet counts (PMID: 8627177)\n\nIn summary, the level of evidence to support the gene-disease relationship of *THPO* and autosomal recessive congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia is moderate. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged. \n\nThis classification was approved by the ClinGen Hemostasis Thrombosis Working Group on March 24, 2022 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e1f0bf7a-4513-4286-b5b4-1d218c02051c","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1f69370e-5f85-4006-b600-75be2d5f482f","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1f69370e-5f85-4006-b600-75be2d5f482f_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2022-03-24T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1f69370e-5f85-4006-b600-75be2d5f482f_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2024-02-08T17:59:48.946Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["DiseaseNameUpdate"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1f69370e-5f85-4006-b600-75be2d5f482f_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7835cc90-2474-4053-b21e-a738e48868c4_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7835cc90-2474-4053-b21e-a738e48868c4","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28466964","rdfs:label":"Noris_Family A_Patient II-2","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3a259cdb-cd46-4667-8fe8-be746917dc36","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000460.4(THPO):c.91C>T (p.Arg31Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA2735063"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypes":"obo:HP_0001873","previousTesting":false,"sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/df8ab26d-6cfc-42c4-b6df-ffe7224c9ae2_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28466964","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3a259cdb-cd46-4667-8fe8-be746917dc36"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"No","zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"}}},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/df8ab26d-6cfc-42c4-b6df-ffe7224c9ae2","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":" The proband was heterozygous for the Arg31Ter nonsense variant in exon 3/6.
