{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b1117982-af64-4724-b2ba-ab78fd23cd94v1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"The relationship between NUBPL and Leigh syndrome spectrum was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of February 26, 2020. The NUBPL gene encodes an iron-sulfur protein important for NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) assembly.\n\nThe NUBPL gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Leigh syndrome spectrum in 2012 (PMID: 22826544). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included five variants identified in three cases in three publications (PMIDs: 22826544, 30897263, 31917109). Loss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease association is also supported by biochemical function, expression, functional alteration in patient cells, and model systems (PMIDs: 19752196, 25613900, 20818383, 23553477, 29982452).\n\nIn summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on February 26, 2020 (SOP Version 7).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b1117982-af64-4724-b2ba-ab78fd23cd94","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4365ffcd-637c-4862-9fa0-fb8a780a6d25","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4365ffcd-637c-4862-9fa0-fb8a780a6d25_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2020-03-19T19:51:15.036Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4365ffcd-637c-4862-9fa0-fb8a780a6d25_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4365ffcd-637c-4862-9fa0-fb8a780a6d25_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4365ffcd-637c-4862-9fa0-fb8a780a6d25_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e4779113-9065-4c23-bf1b-f6fc8841eb52","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Scoring was based off of U24 working group model rubric","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a242be7b-546d-457a-b179-52b9f4193f3e","type":"Finding","dc:description":"The Yeast model demonstrated a biochemical phenotype (reduced complex I and alterations in complex I assembly) that has been reported in individuals with Leigh syndrome","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29982452","rdfs:label":"Yeast model of NUBPL","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4365ffcd-637c-4862-9fa0-fb8a780a6d25_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c93ee9c0-d495-428e-a939-131d7c729ca2","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"one patient cell culture model with disrupted gene function showing mitochondrial dysfunction in a non-neuronal cell type (Awarded 1 pt)","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c024850a-6be3-4923-8c8d-a6301f35d7e2","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Fibroblasts demonstrated reduced complex I activity (19% of control) which was rescued by wt  expression of NUPBL cDNA.
