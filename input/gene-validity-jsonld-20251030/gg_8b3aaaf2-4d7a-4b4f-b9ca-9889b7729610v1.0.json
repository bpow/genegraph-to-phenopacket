Defects of this protein lead to complex IV deficiency. \n\n*COX15* was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive primary mitochondrial disease in 2003 in an individual with fatal, infantile hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (PMID: 12474143). While various names could be given to the constellation of features seen in those with *COX15*-related disease, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *COX15* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework. Of note, *COX15* was previously curated by this GCEP on April 22, 2019 (SOP Version 6) as having a Limited association with Leigh Syndrome Spectrum (LSS). The scope of this current curation encompassed cases of primary mitochondrial disease, which includes LSS.   \n\nEvidence supporting the gene-disease relationship between *COX15* and primary mitochondrial disease includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation includes six unique variants (four missense including the p.Arg217Trp variant that appears to be recurrent as it was scored in five probands from different populations, one nonsense, one splicing) in nine probands from nine publications (PMIDs: 15235026, 12474143, 15863660, 21412973, 26959537, 32232962, 33746038, 34440436, 31967322). Affected individuals present with a broad phenotypic spectrum of disease which may include seizures, hypotonia, ataxia, psychomotor retardation, vision loss, dysphagia, microcephaly, encephalopathy, and gliosis as well as cardiomyopathy. MRI findings are often consistent with LSS. The age of onset ranges from birth to early childhood. Where assessed, affected individuals present with persistent lactic acidosis and complex IV deficiency. Loss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. \n\nThis gene-disease association is also supported by known biochemical function, functional alteration in patient fibroblasts, and a mouse model which recapitulates aspects of mitochondrial disease (PMIDs: 33340416, 12474143, 21723506, 26039449).    \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support this gene-disease relationship, including that more than three years have elapsed from the first proposal of the association. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on December 4, 2023 (SOP Version 9).
