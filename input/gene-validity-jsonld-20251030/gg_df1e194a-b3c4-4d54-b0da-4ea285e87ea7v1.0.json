At least 141 variants (missense, in-frame indel, nonsense, frameshift, large deletion) have been reported in humans (PMIDs 16879200, 8955270, 9837815, 10094187, 9832033). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, experimental data. For the purposes of this curation 11 patients with variants in this gene were scored in 2 publications (PMIDs 10094187, 11180593). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism for disease is X-linked loss-of-function (PMIDs 11180593, 10094187). This gene-disease association is supported by at least two separately generated knockout mouse models, cell culture models, functional alteration studies, and expression studies during human development (PMIDs 14678837, 26398944, 11113183, 17033934, 20832397). In summary, RPS6KA3 is definitively associated with X-linked Coffin-Lowry syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen ID/Autism Expert Panel on 5/28/2019 (SOP Version 6).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/df1e194a-b3c4-4d54-b0da-4ea285e87ea7","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/af32a931-1d55-432f-82cf-ce87f6c26580","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/af32a931-1d55-432f-82cf-ce87f6c26580_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2019-05-28T04:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/af32a931-1d55-432f-82cf-ce87f6c26580_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/af32a931-1d55-432f-82cf-ce87f6c26580_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/af32a931-1d55-432f-82cf-ce87f6c26580_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/538fe461-4a58-4b9d-b290-9706061af189","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"This mouse model is a recapitualiton of the intellectual disability features seen in Coffin-Lowry syndrome","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/949b6c93-aada-44b7-a6d0-da71d92d6f86","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Impaired learning and cognitive functions are features of offin Lowry syndrome seen in humans.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11113183","rdfs:label":"RSK2 -/- mouse","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4811dfae-1efc-4f0c-a7e8-620b16101726","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Mouse is model of Coffin-Lowry syndrome of intellectual disability and skeletal abnormalities.

Rsk2-deficient mice showed a mild impairment of spatial working memory, delayed acquisition of a spatial reference memory task and long-term spatial memory deficits. In contrast, associative and recognition memory, as well as the habituation of exploratory activity were normal. Our studies also revealed mild signs of disinhibition in exploratory activity, as well as a difficulty to adapt to new test environments, which likely contributed to the learning impairments displayed by Rsk2-deficient mice. The observed behavioral changes are in line with observations made in other mouse models of human mental retardation and support a role of Rsk2 in cognitive functions.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17033934","rdfs:label":"RSK2-deficinent mice
