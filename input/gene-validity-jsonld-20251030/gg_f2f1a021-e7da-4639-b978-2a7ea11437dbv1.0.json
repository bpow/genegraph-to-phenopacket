LAP1 localizes to the inner nuclear membrane, where it interacts with emerin and lamins, playing a crucial role in maintaining the structural integrity of the nuclear envelope. In humans, alternative start site usage produces two LAP1 isoforms, LAP1B and LAP1C, which lacks 122 amino acids from the N-terminus of LAP1B. While the functions of the two isoforms have not been completely characterized, distinct expression patterns are recognized, with LAP1B expressed at higher levels in skeletal muscle and LAP1C more highly expressed during the early stages of differentiation (PMID: 37108075).  \n\nTOR1AIP1 was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive muscular dystrophy, cardiomyopathy, and respiratory involvement in 2014 (Kayman-Kurekci et al., PMID: 24856141). Variants in TOR1AIP1 have subsequently been reported in individuals with additional features like congenital myasthenic syndrome as well as more severe multisystemic disease including hearing loss, cataract, skin abnormalities, growth anomalies, dystonia, cerebellar atrophy, neurodevelopmental delays, hypotonia, and progeroid features (PMID: 24856141, 27342937, 32873274, 33405017, 34164833, 33215087, 32055997, 30723199, 25425325). Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in inheritance pattern or underlying molecular mechanism but identified differences in phenotype linked to isoform specificity: variants causing biallelic loss of only LAP1B seem to result in muscle-specific presentations, whereas loss of both LAP1B and LAP1C function is related to more severe syndromic disease. Given the evidence for the genotype-phenotype correlation and the distinct genetic testing context for each end of the spectrum, we opted to curate the muscle-specific, often adult-onset phenotypes as TOR1AIP1-related myopathy (MONDO:0100582; includes MIM #617072) and the multi-systemic, often early-onset presentations as TOR1AIP1-related multisystem disorder (MONDO:0100591; completed in collaboration with the Syndromic Disorders GCEP). Both of these entities, along with any intermediate phenotypes that may be recognized in the future, can be considered part of the broader spectrum of TOR1AIP1-related nuclear envelopathy (MONDO:0100604). \n\nThe evidence for TOR1AIP1-related myopathy includes case-level and experimental data. Five variants (4 frameshift and 1 missense) reported in six probands from six publications (PMID: 33405017, 32873274, 27342937, 24856141, 34164833, 33215087) are included in the curation. The maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss of function, specifically of the LAP1B isoform. Experimental evidence (3 pts) includes a direct interaction with emerin, which is encoded by another gene associated with muscle disease (PMID: 2405565); a specific loss of LAP1B expression in patient fibroblasts but retained expression of LAP1C (PMID: 33405017) and impaired muscle strength in muscle-specific LAP1 knockout mouse models (PMID: 33215087). \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between TOR1AIP1 and autosomal recessive TOR1AIP1-related myopathy. This relationship has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time.\n\nThis classification was approved by the ClinGen Muscular Dystrophies and Myopathies GCEP on November 12, 2024 (SOP Version 11).\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f2f1a021-e7da-4639-b978-2a7ea11437db","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6d671760-7ca7-4319-846b-a953ddcea700","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6d671760-7ca7-4319-846b-a953ddcea700_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10151","date":"2024-11-12T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6d671760-7ca7-4319-846b-a953ddcea700_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10151","date":"2025-07-21T19:42:55.484Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6d671760-7ca7-4319-846b-a953ddcea700_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b3bf4f00-5e36-41bc-b94e-e982caa6c253_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/da417c2b-a071-4e9d-b1f9-0b4fdfdce5af","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":3.0,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/da417c2b-a071-4e9d-b1f9-0b4fdfdce5af_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32873274","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f53f0735-326c-4026-acd6-c09075c84cb8","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_015602.4(TOR1AIP1):c.101dup (p.Gln35SerfsTer?)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA2586967788"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":3.0},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b3bf4f00-5e36-41bc-b94e-e982caa6c253","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32873274","rdfs:label":"Feng F1 IV.1","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":8,"allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f53f0735-326c-4026-acd6-c09075c84cb8"},"ethnicity":{"id":"cg:NotHispanicOrLatino"},"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"Muscle morphology: Fiber size variability, atrophy, internal and fragmented nuclei, cores","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0008180","obo:HP_0003323","obo:HP_0003701","obo:HP_0001771","obo:HP_0008959"],"previousTesting":false,"sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/da417c2b-a071-4e9d-b1f9-0b4fdfdce5af_variant_evidence_item"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria","strengthScore":3.0},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f284c375-b824-479d-a742-ed845f35aceb_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fc973326-3c86-43de-a6b4-cb99c4c486e4","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":3.0,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fc973326-3c86-43de-a6b4-cb99c4c486e4_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"RT-PCR and western blot showed decreased LAP1B expression in patient IV:2 (with the same genotype as IV:5).","functionalDataSupport":"No"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fc973326-3c86-43de-a6b4-cb99c4c486e4_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24856141","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5ec6dae3-b7f7-4f74-a595-98ad8d7540d1","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_015602.4(TOR1AIP1):c.186del (p.Glu62AspfsTer26)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA10586175"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":3.0},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f284c375-b824-479d-a742-ed845f35aceb","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24856141","rdfs:label":"Kayman-Kurekci F1 IV.5","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":7,"allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5ec6dae3-b7f7-4f74-a595-98ad8d7540d1"},"detectionMethod":"Genome-wide homozygosity mapping showed a single homozygous haplotype shared by the three affected individuals on chromosomal region 1q25 (Fig. 4A).
