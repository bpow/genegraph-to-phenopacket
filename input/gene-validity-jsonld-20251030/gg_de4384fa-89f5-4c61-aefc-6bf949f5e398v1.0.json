This association was made using case-level data only. At least 7 missense, frameshift, nonsense, and splice-site variants have been reported in humans. RDX​ was first associated with this disease in humans as early as 2007​ (Khan et al.​). Association is seen in at least 6​ probands in 4​ publications (17226784, 19215054, 22567349, 26226137), as well as one unpublished case at the Laboratory for Molecular Medicine. Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 11​ additional family members. This gene-disease association is supported by a null mouse model and relevant expression and protein interaction studies. In summary, RDX​ is definitively associated with autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hearing Loss Working Group on 1/2/2018.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/de4384fa-89f5-4c61-aefc-6bf949f5e398","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2cf494e5-7335-4e2a-8b50-75cf8412a9d0","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2cf494e5-7335-4e2a-8b50-75cf8412a9d0_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2cf494e5-7335-4e2a-8b50-75cf8412a9d0_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2018-01-02T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2cf494e5-7335-4e2a-8b50-75cf8412a9d0_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d5399ddb-78c4-443d-a1d1-53b2fafccd8a_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Variant is present in 1/108648 European (non-Finnish) alleles in gnomAD.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4ab50021-7ec5-46bf-9aed-44c2a35f7e65","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22567349","rdfs:label":"Family 4208 Proband","ageType":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/","ageUnit":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/","detectionMethod":"Linkage analysis","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0011476","obo:HP_0000399"],"previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d5399ddb-78c4-443d-a1d1-53b2fafccd8a_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22567349","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9c44c03d-5a93-4a5f-a993-12c7eedef904","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001260492.1(RDX):c.1076_1079del (p.Ile359LysfsTer6)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA6270147"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"}}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9ccdda94-39ee-405e-9723-ed88f21fb6b9_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/84c1377d-289b-4176-a3ad-25214c5873b5","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19215054","rdfs:label":"Shearer Proband","ageType":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/","ageUnit":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/","detectionMethod":"Linkage analysis, only RDX was sequenced","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0012714","obo:HP_0008527","obo:HP_0011476"],"previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9ccdda94-39ee-405e-9723-ed88f21fb6b9_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19215054","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6ef13987-ac02-437f-9ed6-3044bf41397b","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001260492.1(RDX):c.698+1G>A (p.=)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA382867794"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"}}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d1c1e6ad-8460-4d03-8b32-63a9cacb4fde_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Variant is absent from gnomAD","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2cc18e0c-1218-4001-8977-5bd7812d78f6","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17226784","rdfs:label":"DFNB24 Proband","ageType":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/","ageUnit":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/","detectionMethod":"Direct sequencing based on similarity in linkage interval and region of origin","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0011476","obo:HP_0000399"],"previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"Family was previously unpublished but found at Richard Smith's lab and linked to same locus.
