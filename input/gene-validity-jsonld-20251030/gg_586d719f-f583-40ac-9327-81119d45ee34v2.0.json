Six variants (missense, nonsense, 5' UTR splicing) have been reported in four probands in four publications, however the association was only scored in one proband as other variants did not have sufficient evidence for pathogenicity (PMIDs: 24164807, 12719379, 17786286, 26969326). This gene-disease relationship has been studied in at least one case-control study at the aggregate variant level (PMID: 19492055). No statistically significant difference was found between patients and controls in the frequency of the identified variants. The mechanism for disease is reported to be loss of function (PMIDs: 24164807, 18466744, 12239568). This gene-disease association is also supported by mouse models, biochemical function studies, and expression studies (PMIDs: 12239568, 10821263, 11423665, 12719379, 18466744, 27091614, 17998209). There is strong evidence that loss of SLC26A5 causes hearing loss in mice, yet there is limited evidence in humans. Researchers have posited that humans have a compensatory mechanism that mice do not have (Hosoya et al. 2016; PMID: 27091614). Due to the lack of convincing human patients, the Hearing Loss Gene Curation Expert Panel classified this gene-disease relationship as Limited. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the Hearing Loss Gene Curation Expert Panel on 12/19/2017.  It was reevaluated on 1/19/2022 (SOP v8).  As a result of this reevaluation, the classification did not change.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/586d719f-f583-40ac-9327-81119d45ee34","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2f835f34-fe68-49a8-9399-bccebba540d4","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","changes":[{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"},{"id":"cg:sopChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2f835f34-fe68-49a8-9399-bccebba540d4_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2022-01-26T20:43:06.173Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2f835f34-fe68-49a8-9399-bccebba540d4_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2022-01-26T20:42:54.928Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"Strong functional evidence in mice, but lack of convincing human cases.","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2f835f34-fe68-49a8-9399-bccebba540d4_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/624b0516-afea-49ba-a399-33b1bbbc0947_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/624b0516-afea-49ba-a399-33b1bbbc0947","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26969326","rdfs:label":"Sloan Heggen 1","allele":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b6424c8a-c102-4b8b-b224-d3b1a01881de","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_198999.3(SLC26A5):c.355C>T (p.Pro119Ser)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA368767516"}},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/947ad64f-1114-45f7-a792-6d65e26a66ae","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_198999.3(SLC26A5):c.298G>A (p.Ala100Thr)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA368767639"}}],"phenotypeFreeText":"congenital HL, \"sporadic\"","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5f7692a2-b60a-4c75-8625-4f2473be01bb_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26969326","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b6424c8a-c102-4b8b-b224-d3b1a01881de"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"}},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/029eabb9-a764-48af-b1a2-07988c22bf57_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26969326","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/947ad64f-1114-45f7-a792-6d65e26a66ae"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"}}]},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/029eabb9-a764-48af-b1a2-07988c22bf57","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"No evidence for pathogenicity other than absence from controls.","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/029eabb9-a764-48af-b1a2-07988c22bf57_variant_evidence_item"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":0.1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5f7692a2-b60a-4c75-8625-4f2473be01bb","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"No evidence for pathogenicity other than absence from controls.","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5f7692a2-b60a-4c75-8625-4f2473be01bb_variant_evidence_item"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":0.1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria","strengthScore":0.2},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6f600648-e4f3-4113-a2de-c331f862187c_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6f600648-e4f3-4113-a2de-c331f862187c","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24164807","rdfs:label":"Mutai Proband","allele":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/03e40b2c-e7f0-42da-b674-2dc7e3efbeb8","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_198999.3(SLC26A5):c.390A>C (p.Arg130Ser)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA149718"}},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/36da2b79-f21e-4301-b38d-7bbd449602d8","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_198999.3(SLC26A5):c.209G>A (p.Trp70Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA149720"}}],"phenotypeFreeText":"bilateral sensorineural hearing loss.
