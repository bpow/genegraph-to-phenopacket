This proband presented in VT of LBBB superior axis morphology and has TWI in leads V1-V4, meeting ARVC TFC criteria.  This variant, however is present in higher than expected prevalence in the East Asian population.  Otherwise, in other studies (29709087) of 137 patients sequenced for TNNI3, no pathogenic variants were found.  Therefore, there is currently no evidence to suggest a role of TNNI3 in pathogenesis of ARVC.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2b9da339-e294-42d3-a0a7-caf0aef101a1","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/21c990ca-e407-4a21-a3e2-237700a75d43","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"NoKnownDiseaseRelationship","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/21c990ca-e407-4a21-a3e2-237700a75d43_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10003","date":"2020-09-16T19:22:58.165Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/21c990ca-e407-4a21-a3e2-237700a75d43_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10003","date":"2019-07-16T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/21c990ca-e407-4a21-a3e2-237700a75d43_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/21c990ca-e407-4a21-a3e2-237700a75d43_seg_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/856943c4-df14-4c03-bb01-efff20a4559d_family_segregation","type":"FamilyCosegregation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30385303","rdfs:label":"6","family":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/856943c4-df14-4c03-bb01-efff20a4559d","type":"Family","rdfs:label":"6","ethnicity":{"id":"cg:NotHispanicOrLatino"}},"phenotypeFreeText":"","phenotypePositiveAllelePositive":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValiditySegregationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/21c990ca-e407-4a21-a3e2-237700a75d43_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0}],"evidenceStrength":"NoKnownDiseaseRelationship","sequence":711,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria7","strengthScore":0,"subject":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/BDzzefBZQCg","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0016587","gene":"hgnc:11947","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"1.0","websiteLegacyID":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/assertion_21c990ca-e407-4a21-a3e2-237700a75d43-","@context":{"@vocab":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"},"curationReasons":{"@type":"@vocab","@container":"@set"},"GCISnapshot":{"@type":"@id"},"dc:isVersionOf":{"@type":"@id"},"websiteLegacyID":{"@type":"@id"}}}
