At least 14 unique variants (e.g. missense, in-frame indel, nonsense, frameshift, and complex rearrangement) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship included case-level data and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 10 probands in 4 publications (PMIDs: 30467204, 28575652, 31987885, 28774589). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 1 additional family member. The gene-disease association is supported by its biochemical function as the KDS reductase in the sphingolipid metabolic pathway (PMID: 15328338), the rescue of aberrant size and proplatelet formation in patient megakaryocytes by the WT KDSR transcript in patient-derived induced-megakaryocytes (PMID: 30467204), and a zebrafish model with impaired thrombocyte formation (PMID: 30467204). In summary, KDSR is definitively associated with autosomal recessive erythrokeratodermia variabilis et progressiva 4.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6f6fcb9b-97fc-494b-b84e-44917362bf38","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0a5d1542-feb7-4aaf-9079-55da7fb99a4a","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0a5d1542-feb7-4aaf-9079-55da7fb99a4a_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2020-07-22T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0a5d1542-feb7-4aaf-9079-55da7fb99a4a_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2020-10-27T13:07:39.467Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0a5d1542-feb7-4aaf-9079-55da7fb99a4a_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/50cad703-7ac0-4614-97b2-372ab09f29cd_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The compound heterozygous variants c.164_166del (paternal origin) and c.879G>A (maternal origin) each cause in-frame variation; c.164_166del causes p.Gln55_Gly56delinsArg and c.879G>A (p.Gln293Gln) occurs at the last base of exon 9 causing the in-frame deletion of exon 9 as confirmed by cDNA analysis.
