The MED12 gene is associated with several disease entities in which all phenotypes occur within the spectrum of X-Linked Syndromic Intellectual Disability (ID). This association was made using case-level data only. Fifteen unique variants segregating in males (14 missense, 1 in-frame indel) and 1 de novo nonsense variant in a female proband have been reported. Female carriers of the MED12 variants can show mild ID and/or facial dysmorphism. MED12 was first associated with this disease in humans in 2007 (Rising et. al). This gene-disease association is supported by functional assays and animal models. In summary, MED12 is definitively associated with X-Linked MED12-related Intellectual Disability Syndrome. This classification was approved by the Intellectual Disability/Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework on 04/18/2018. Lumping and Splitting : Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in molecular mechanism or inheritance pattern underlying the disease entities: (1) Lujan-Fryns Syndrome (MIM:309520), (2) Ohdo Syndrome (MIM:300895), and (3) Opitz-Kaveggia (FG) Syndrome (MIM:305450). Therefore the entities (MIM:309520, MIM:300895, MIM:305450) have been lumped into one disease entity, X-Linked MED12-related Intellectual Disability Syndrome.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/92c2ce8c-377c-487f-8442-bf07ee5c947c","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6cd1934e-767c-41bb-9fce-542dbf34c5fa","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Strong","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6cd1934e-767c-41bb-9fce-542dbf34c5fa_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Unpublisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/afba0573-9f47-4814-bf3a-ef41f5512dee_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":["2018-04-27T19:38:08.041Z","2018-04-27T19:38:03.940Z"],"role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/afba0573-9f47-4814-bf3a-ef41f5512dee_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"True total score is 14.5 with additional LOD scoring counted by original curator 3(8.74*).","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/afba0573-9f47-4814-bf3a-ef41f5512dee_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/afba0573-9f47-4814-bf3a-ef41f5512dee_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2469a7d2-7ff2-4cac-a81b-4ea53bb11fff","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Downgraded since ID is hard to ascertain but assume brain function is related.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/efbbf666-de2f-4e4f-8990-1aa0047d5e46","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Embryo brain phenotype similar to WT.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16344459","rdfs:label":"kto rescue","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:PhenotypeRescue"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanRescueCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/24dd583a-836e-45b6-8afb-5660fe4438c7","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0f8cb1c6-853d-4134-95f0-0f3fd4ff3206","type":"Finding","dc:description":"De-repression of REST target genes was reversed back to wild-type levels.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23395478","rdfs:label":"MED12 knockdown","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:PhenotypeRescue"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCellCultureRescueCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/afba0573-9f47-4814-bf3a-ef41f5512dee_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8c991161-568e-4ce6-9c51-2a6d5cd16b0d","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/54d4f69c-5626-45f6-aceb-9fa31e2ed0e3","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Quantitative RT-PCR on total mRNA extract clearly showed that JUN, FOS and EGR1 expression is down regulated in MED12-KD cells as confirmed by the decrease of their protein synthesis.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28369444","rdfs:label":"CRISPR/Cas9 MED12-KD"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/afba0573-9f47-4814-bf3a-ef41f5512dee_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1093819c-66d9-4aa4-883e-174121bb657f","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3895d3b7-f3da-40ca-81d1-b01c378dd4c5","type":"Finding","dc:description":"MED12 is a direct and functionally important transducer of canonical Wnt/b\u0001-catenin signaling.
