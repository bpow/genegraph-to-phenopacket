Variants in ACADSB were first reported in humans with this deficiency as early as 2000 (Gibson, PMID:  10832746; Andresen, PMID:  11013134). The clinical significance of this disease is uncertain because almost 90% of patients are asymptomatic (Porta, 2019, PMID: 30730842). At least 15 variants have been reported in the literature (missense, nonsense, splicing).  In summary, ACADSB is deﬁnitively associated with autosomal recessive 2-methylbutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. The classification was approved by the ClinGen Aminoacidopathy Gene Curation Expert Panel on March 22nd, 2019.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/47d12850-349e-45d2-aa41-8d773d4f1f00","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8bfa3857-c96c-40ac-b4c1-2cf04fd4eb4f","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8bfa3857-c96c-40ac-b4c1-2cf04fd4eb4f_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10011","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8bfa3857-c96c-40ac-b4c1-2cf04fd4eb4f_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10011","date":"2019-03-22T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8bfa3857-c96c-40ac-b4c1-2cf04fd4eb4f_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8bfa3857-c96c-40ac-b4c1-2cf04fd4eb4f_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6172471a-5024-4c47-9077-d733f76691fe_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"PCR of cDNA using primers in exon 9 and exon 11 showed that exon 10 was missing.
