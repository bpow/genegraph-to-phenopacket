One unique 4- Mb de novo inversion that has been reported in one proband with CHD in one publication is included in this curation (PMID:  19471316). This gene-disease relationship is supported by expression evidence and an animal model. (PMID:19091769, 19471316). In summary, the evidence supporting the relationship between *PROX1* and congenital heart disease has been disputed, and no valid evidence remains to support the claim. More evidence is needed to either support or entirely refute the role *PROX1* plays in this disease. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Congenital Heart Disease GCEP on the meeting date August 12th, 2024 (SOP Version 10).
