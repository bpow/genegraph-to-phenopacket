Biallelic inheritance of more than 20 unique variants that are predicted to result in a hypomorphic protein have been reported in >90% of the individuals with clinical diagnosis of Shwachman-Diamond Syndrome. SBDS is reported to play an essential role in ribosome biogenesis. Two of the recurring variants, as well as some others, arise from a gene-conversion event between SBDS and its pseudogene SBDSP1, and they are found in 60% and 90% of the affected individuals with pathogenic SBDS variants either together or with another variant, respectively. This gene-disease relationship is supported by animal models, rescue experiments, and functional experiments. In summary, SBDS is definitively associated with autosomal recessive Shwachman-Diamond Syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/300452d9-1939-4ef4-8043-85b00e94ff1a","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7c2a84f0-e42d-487f-a2af-5b536a30d30c","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7c2a84f0-e42d-487f-a2af-5b536a30d30c_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10023","date":"2020-09-16T19:23:29.187Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7c2a84f0-e42d-487f-a2af-5b536a30d30c_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10023","date":"2020-07-30T21:04:01.699Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7c2a84f0-e42d-487f-a2af-5b536a30d30c_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7c2a84f0-e42d-487f-a2af-5b536a30d30c_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3354002c-1baa-47dc-b011-2cf1561757e7","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Expression profile is not specific for the disease.
