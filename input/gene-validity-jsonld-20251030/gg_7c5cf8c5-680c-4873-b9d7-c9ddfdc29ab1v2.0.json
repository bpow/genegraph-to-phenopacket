Evidence of the association of this gene with DCM was re-evaluated using SOP v10 on May 29th, 2025. As a result, the classification did not change. A summary of the information contributing to the classification of this gene at the time of re-evaluation is summarized herein. \n\nPDLIM3 was evaluated for autosomal dominant dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). There is no supporting human genetic evidence demonstrating this gene-disease relationship in the literature at the time of curation. Wang and colleagues (2019, PMID: 31424159) designed a case‐control study in 111 idiopathic DCM patients and 137 healthy controls. PDLIM3 and PDLIM5 exons were amplified by polymerase chain reactions. Authors identified five synonymous polymorphisms showing statistical distribution differences between DCM patients and controls. In addition, Arola and colleagues (2007, PMID: 17254821) investigated 185 unrelated DCM patients by polymerase chain reaction and identified a truncating variant (c.178insCA) in PDLIM3. However, lack of segregation data and additional info related to other genes, the DCM GCEP excluded this variant as supporting evidence. There is no experimental evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship. \n\nIn summary, the evidence presented for this gene-disease relationship does not provide convincing human genetic evidence in support of or refuting the role of PDLIM3 and autosomal dominant DCM. The relationship of PDLIM3 with DCM is unclear and therefore classified as disputed. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Dilated Cardiomyopathy Working Group on May 29th, 2025 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7c5cf8c5-680c-4873-b9d7-c9ddfdc29ab1","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/78f8d362-f690-4319-912f-1bdceceacccd","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"NoKnownDiseaseRelationship","changes":[{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"},{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},{"id":"cg:sopChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/78f8d362-f690-4319-912f-1bdceceacccd_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10035","date":"2025-05-30T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/78f8d362-f690-4319-912f-1bdceceacccd_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10035","date":"2025-09-04T14:53:25.694Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"Only a variant identified in one patient without segregation data and experimental evidence.","curationReasons":["RecurationTiming"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/78f8d362-f690-4319-912f-1bdceceacccd_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/78f8d362-f690-4319-912f-1bdceceacccd_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7261a408-ea45-4725-9823-768c3325ec5b","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"No segregation data, no information about genetic background (variants in other DCM associated genes).","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7261a408-ea45-4725-9823-768c3325ec5b_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17254821","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2950b388-8435-49d3-ad44-5b3620532e75","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_014476.6(PDLIM3):c.177_178dup (p.Met60ThrfsTer2)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA215387"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:AlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Heterozygous"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":0}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0}],"evidenceStrength":"Disputed","sequence":11503,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria10","strengthScore":0,"subject":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/v10lzj_7nmI","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0005021","gene":"hgnc:20767","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"2.0","websiteLegacyID":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/assertion_78f8d362-f690-4319-912f-1bdceceacccd-","@context":{"@vocab":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"},"curationReasons":{"@type":"@vocab","@container":"@set"},"GCISnapshot":{"@type":"@id"},"dc:isVersionOf":{"@type":"@id"},"websiteLegacyID":{"@type":"@id"}}}
