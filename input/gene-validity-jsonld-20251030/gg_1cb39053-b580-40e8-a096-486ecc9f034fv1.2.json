At least 32 variants have been reported (3 nonsense, 5 frameshift, 5 splice site, 17 missense, and 2 CNV deletions); 4 were de novo, 12 inherited (including 7 truncating variants), and 6 were of unknown inheritance.  It is unlikely that these variants are the cause for the neurodevelopmental disorders present in these individuals. In many of the reported cases, the variants are inherited from parents that are either reportedly unaffected or have no phenotype information, they do not segregate with disease [PMID: 25621899, 28191889, 32094338], or are present in population databases at frequencies too high to be causative of disease [PMID: 28191889, 31981491]. In addition, KATNAL2 truncating variants have also been reported in controls [PMID: 25363760, 30208311, 31981491]. Further, per data from gnomAD, KATNAL2 appears to be tolerant of variation in general - the gene is not constrained for either missense or protein truncating variants.  This makes it difficult to discern a potential disease mechanism and raises the question of whether the variants reported in the affected individuals occurred just by chance.  In our review of the literature, we found no compelling genetic evidence in humans to support the relationship between KATNAL2 and complex neurodevelopmental disorders.  This gene-disease pair has been classified as DISPUTED by the ClinGen ID/Autism GCEP as of 2020 May 20.","Variants in *KATNAL2* have been reported in numerous individuals with complex neurodevelopmental disorder, including autism spectrum disorder (PMIDs: 22495306, 22495309, 22495311, 25363760, 25621899, 28191889, 30504930, 31209962, 31398340, 31981491, 32094338) and intellectual disability (PMIDs: 28191889, 31209962, 32094338). The first reports were published in autism in 2012 (PMIDs: 22495306, 22495309, 22495311).\n\nAt least 32 variants have been reported (3 nonsense, 5 frameshift, 5 splice site, 17 missense, and 2 CNV deletions); 4 were *de novo*, 12 inherited (including 7 truncating variants), and 6 were of unknown inheritance. It is unlikely that these variants are the cause for the neurodevelopmental disorders present in these individuals. In many of the reported cases, the variants are inherited from parents that are either reportedly unaffected or have no phenotype information, they do not segregate with disease (PMIDs: 25621899, 28191889, 32094338), or are present in population databases at frequencies too high to be causative of disease (PMIDs: 28191889, 31981491). In addition, *KATNAL2* truncating variants have been reported in control subjects (PMIDs: 25363760, 30208311, 31981491). Further, per data from gnomAD, *KATNAL2* appears to be tolerant of variation in general - the gene is not constrained for either missense or protein truncating variants.  This makes it difficult to discern a potential disease mechanism and raises the question of whether the variants reported in the affected individuals occurred just by chance.\n\nIn summary, the evidence supporting the relationship between *KATNAL2* and autosomal dominant complex neurodevelopmental disorder has been disputed and no valid evidence remains to support the claim. More evidence is needed to either support or entirely refute the role *KATNAL2* plays in this disease. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel on May 20, 2020 (SOP Version 7)."],"dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1cb39053-b580-40e8-a096-486ecc9f034f","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/eddbdd3e-2f6b-4b55-a951-988ee214b08b","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"NoKnownDiseaseRelationship","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/eddbdd3e-2f6b-4b55-a951-988ee214b08b_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2025-08-06T10:28:43.094Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/eddbdd3e-2f6b-4b55-a951-988ee214b08b_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":["2020-05-20T16:00:00.000Z","2020-05-19T22:00:00.000Z"],"role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"KATNAL2
