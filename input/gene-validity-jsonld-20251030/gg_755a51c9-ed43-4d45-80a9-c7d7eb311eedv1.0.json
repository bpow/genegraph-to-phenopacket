In total, four SMAD4 variants (missense, non-canonical splice, and in frame deletion) have been reported (PMIDs: 21898662, 31727138). However, none of the variants were scorable. The relationship between SMAD4 and PAH is supported by SMAD4 biochemical function in rats with pulmonary hypertension (PMID:18367643). However, the gene-disease relationship betwen SMAD4 and PAH is classified as disputed due to insufficient genetic evidence over multiple years of research. This classification was approved by the ClinGen PH Gene Curation Expert Panel on 8/30/2022 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/755a51c9-ed43-4d45-80a9-c7d7eb311eed","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/12d82f9f-8ab2-4012-a5d5-20de99f23c07","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"NoKnownDiseaseRelationship","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/12d82f9f-8ab2-4012-a5d5-20de99f23c07_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10071","date":"2022-11-21T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/12d82f9f-8ab2-4012-a5d5-20de99f23c07_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10071","date":"2022-11-21T22:20:11.520Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"Only two probands have been reported with HPAH/IPAH and SMAD4 variants.
