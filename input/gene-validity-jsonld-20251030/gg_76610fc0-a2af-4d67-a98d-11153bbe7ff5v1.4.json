This disease entity was named Developmental and Epileptic Encephalopathy type 54 (DEE54, OMIM #617391). To date, approximately 75 patients with heterozygous *HNRNPU* sequence variants have been published in the literature (Taylor et al., 2022, PMID: 35138025). Except where parental samples were not available, all probands had *de novo* variants. Commonly reported phenotypes include developmental delay, intellectual disability, seizures, non-specific dysmorphic features, hypotonia, feeding difficulties, short stature, behavioral issues, autism or autistic features, strabismus, abnormalities on brain MRI, cardiac defects, and renal anomalies. The majority of reported variants are frameshift, nonsense, and canonical splicing variants; a smaller number of missense and small in-frame deletions have been reported. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in molecular mechanism, inheritance pattern, or phenotypic variability. Therefore, we opted to lump into one disease entity, complex neurodevelopmental disorder. \n\nSix variants (2 nonsense and 4 frameshift, all *de novo*) that have been reported in 6 probands in 3 publications (PMIDs: 28393272, 35138025, 28944577) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. Of note, the Brain Gene Registry includes 5 subjects with *de novo HNRNPU* variants, including one each of nonsense, frameshift, whole gene deletion, missense, and splicing variants (BGR study IDs: 110004101, 113017101, 110003101, 110017101, 104002101). The mechanism of pathogenicity is reported to be loss-of-function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence including a mouse model and biochemical function (PMIDs: 35864088, 33874999). \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between *HNRNPU* and autosomal dominant complex neurodevelopmental disorder. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism Expert Panel on November 10, 2022 (SOP Version 9).","*HNRNPU* was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant complex neurodevelopmental disorder in 2013 (Carvill et al., PMID: 237081887).
