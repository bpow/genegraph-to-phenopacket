However, this individual had an alternate genetic explanation for disease. Another reported variant is likely benign (PMID 25892673). Two case control studies have shown no enrichment of *CASQ2* variants in HCM cohorts (PMIDs 28082330, 23396983). As such, early disease assertions for this gene have been disputed by more recent literature. This gene is expressed in the heart (PMID 24309898), but its expression is not altered in disease states (PMID 12118103). Animal studies have shown no structural disease in heterozygote models and only mild late onset left ventricular hypertrophy without myocyte disarray in homozygote models. (PMIDs 17607358, 17656677, 9774476, 27484853). \n\nThis gene-disease relationship was originally evaluated by the ClinGen Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy GCEP on January 17, 2017. It was re-evaluated on March 10, 2022. As a result of this recuration, the classification changed from the original No Known Disease Relationship (formerly No reported Evidence) to Disputed. In summary, the evidence supporting the relationship between *CASQ2* and autosomal dominant Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy has been DISPUTED and no valid evidence remains to support the claim. More evidence is needed to either support or entirely refute the role *CASQ2* plays in HCM. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hereditary Cardiovascular Diseases GCEP on March 9, 2022.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/afb2e6ca-f948-4850-be42-ed7d7d1842ed","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/07177c89-7845-4df5-ba3e-bdd415b5c8b3","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","changes":[{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"},{"id":"cg:sopChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/07177c89-7845-4df5-ba3e-bdd415b5c8b3_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10104","date":"2022-05-10T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/07177c89-7845-4df5-ba3e-bdd415b5c8b3_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10104","date":"2022-10-31T20:26:26.684Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"Since the first assertion in 2007 there has been data to dispute a gene-disease relationship including two case control studies showing no enrichment of variants in HCM cases vs. controls (PMIDs 28082330, 23396983).
