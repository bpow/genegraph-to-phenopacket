Characteristics of HIGM include susceptibility to bacterial infections, lymphoid hyperplasia, increased serum IgM concentrations and profoundly decreased serum IgG and IgA concentrations. Six variants (3 frameshift, 2 missense, and 1 single amino acid deletion) have been reported in five probands in three publications (PMIDs: 12958596, 32135276, 23585684). This gene-disease association is supported by its function as an uracil-DNA glycosylase (PMID: 12214226) with a role in class switch recombination. Additionally, UNG deficiency is linked to a profound inability of human B cells to undergo immunoglobulin class switch recombination in association with qualitative consequences for the pattern of somatic hypermutation (PMID: 12958596) and a mouse model that recapitulates disease (PMID: 12401169). In summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/94403c03-a325-49ab-9ded-dd85b5216e2e","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/336745e2-39bc-429c-8b0d-fd73216522a5","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/336745e2-39bc-429c-8b0d-fd73216522a5_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10080","date":"2021-08-17T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/336745e2-39bc-429c-8b0d-fd73216522a5_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10080","date":"2021-08-17T12:43:54.269Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/336745e2-39bc-429c-8b0d-fd73216522a5_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/336745e2-39bc-429c-8b0d-fd73216522a5_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3e2bff1e-5602-4b19-b2d6-ff1ebb83d6b7","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"This recapitulates the UNG-deficient human phenotype of HIGM, although the CSR defect was much more pronounced in humans.
