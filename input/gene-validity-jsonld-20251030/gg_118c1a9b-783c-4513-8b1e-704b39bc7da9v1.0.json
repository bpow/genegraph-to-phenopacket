{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/118c1a9b-783c-4513-8b1e-704b39bc7da9v1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"The relationship between *NDUFS1* and primary mitochondrial disease was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of November 6, 2023. The *NDUFS1* gene encodes the mitochondrial NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase 75 kDa subunit, a core subunit of mitochondrial complex I. Defects of this protein lead to complex I deficiency. \n\n*NDUFS1* was first reported in relation to primary mitochondrial disease in 2001 (PMID: 11349233), in three probands with Leigh syndrome spectrum (LSS). While various names have been given to the constellation of features seen in those with *NDUFS1*-related disease, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *NDUFS1* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework. Of note, *NDUFS1* was previously curated by this GCEP on June 10, 2019 (SOP Version 6) as having a definitive association with autosomal recessive LSS. The scope of this current curation encompassed cases of primary mitochondrial disease, which includes LSS.   \n\nEvidence supporting the relationship between *NDUFS1* and autosomal recessive primary mitochondrial disease includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation includes 18 variants identified in 13 unrelated probands from six publications (PMIDs: 11349233, 24952175, 25615419, 21458341, 22200994, 20382551). Variant types included missense, stop-gained, frameshift, and an in-frame deletion. Affected individuals present with complex I deficiency and variable other features with a typically progressive disease course. Age of onset is typically in infancy. Clinical features may include developmental delay and regression, movement disorder, seizures, leukodystrophy, atrophy and cystic lesions in the brain, hypotonia, optic atrophy, failure to thrive, and elevated serum and cerebrospinal fluid lactate. The mechanism of disease involves loss of function. \n\nThis gene-disease association is also supported by a biochemical function in mitochondrial complex I shared by more than 10 other genes also associated with primary mitochondrial disease as well as evidence of disrupted mitochondrial function in patient cells that could be rescued by expression of the wildtype protein (PMIDs: 21458341, 20382551, 33340416).\n\n In summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between *NDUFS1* and primary mitochondrial disease. This relationship has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on November 6, 2023 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/118c1a9b-783c-4513-8b1e-704b39bc7da9","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/048cc8f0-7d27-4108-ada2-5454791c0bc5","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/048cc8f0-7d27-4108-ada2-5454791c0bc5_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2024-01-22T16:12:58.768Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/048cc8f0-7d27-4108-ada2-5454791c0bc5_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2023-11-06T05:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/048cc8f0-7d27-4108-ada2-5454791c0bc5_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/48c6ad3a-8c4b-4022-ad19-7700b77e70ac_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bb07ad2f-759d-4961-b93b-30e4c872c7e9","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"+0.5 to case for complex I deficiency","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bb07ad2f-759d-4961-b93b-30e4c872c7e9_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"NMD expected","functionalDataSupport":"No"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bb07ad2f-759d-4961-b93b-30e4c872c7e9_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22200994","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/619ad42d-3f6b-4b37-b7e5-88c9739cb448","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_005006.7(NDUFS1):c.1669C>T (p.Arg557Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA143871"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":1.75},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2b404418-e73b-4037-bf92-3f344754887b","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"+0.5 to case for complex I deficiency","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2b404418-e73b-4037-bf92-3f344754887b_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22200994","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6036e844-a0a9-4d3c-9384-ae6d38d267b4","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_005006.7(NDUFS1):c.1783A>G (p.Thr595Ala)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA129896"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":0.25},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/48c6ad3a-8c4b-4022-ad19-7700b77e70ac","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22200994","rdfs:label":"Haack 20212 patient 35837","allele":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/619ad42d-3f6b-4b37-b7e5-88c9739cb448"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6036e844-a0a9-4d3c-9384-ae6d38d267b4"}],"detectionMethod":"45 subunits of complex I, the mtDNA-encoded\ntRNAs and eight accessory factors including NDUFAF1,\nNDUFAF2, NDUFAF4, NDUFAB1 (MIM 603836), ECSIT (MIM\n608388), ACAD9, FOXRED1 and NUBPL.","phenotypeFreeText":"elevated plasma and CSF lactate; complex I activity <25%; leukodystrophy; MRS lactate peak in brain; developmental regression; muscular hypotonia; psychomotor developmental delay; progressive course","previousTesting":false,"sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2b404418-e73b-4037-bf92-3f344754887b_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bb07ad2f-759d-4961-b93b-30e4c872c7e9_variant_evidence_item"}]}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria","strengthScore":2.0},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d2cb9b92-ce83-4b15-9920-41b4ceb64783_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/662f151f-d456-4f62-8207-d42de9515c48","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/662f151f-d456-4f62-8207-d42de9515c48_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"Oxidation of NADH-generating substrates was low in muscle mitochondria in fibroblasts, and in circulating lymphocytes.
