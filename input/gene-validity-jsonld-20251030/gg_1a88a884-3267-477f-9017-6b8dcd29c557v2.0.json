(25601850). At least 1 missense variant has been reported in a proband. The variant segregated in 7 additional family members. This gene-disease association is supported by case-level, segregation and experimental evidence. Expert review concluded a limited gene-disease association. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease association. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hearing Loss Working Group on 8/31/2020.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1a88a884-3267-477f-9017-6b8dcd29c557","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/86802e37-e2a5-43b9-8538-e104859b4c55","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","changes":[{"id":"cg:sopChange"},{"id":"cg:summaryChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/86802e37-e2a5-43b9-8538-e104859b4c55_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2020-09-16T19:23:38.515Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/86802e37-e2a5-43b9-8538-e104859b4c55_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2020-08-31T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"Experts approved this curation as Limited, because there is only one family with genetic evidence.","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/86802e37-e2a5-43b9-8538-e104859b4c55_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/86802e37-e2a5-43b9-8538-e104859b4c55_seg_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/554442fc-e6ce-4a8d-bbbb-85dbd9f6b172_proband_segregation","type":"FamilyCosegregation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25601850","rdfs:label":"Grati Family","estimatedLodScore":5.09,"family":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/554442fc-e6ce-4a8d-bbbb-85dbd9f6b172","type":"Family","rdfs:label":"Grati Family","ethnicity":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/"},"member":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/94a135f1-a543-4150-850f-a5a7ed6136fa","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25601850","rdfs:label":"Grati Proband","ageType":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/","ageUnit":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/","detectionMethod":"WES","firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0008527","obo:HP_0011476"],"previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/069c2383-14d1-4c82-b76f-22815ef470a9_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25601850","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/64b9553c-0920-4efd-b849-8ed284dfdcb4","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001195610.1(DCDC2):c.1271A>C (p.Gln424Pro)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/161160"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"}}}},"meetsInclusionCriteria":true,"phenotypeFreeText":"","phenotypeNegativeAlleleNegative":7,"phenotypePositiveAllelePositive":8,"phenotypes":["obo:HP_0011476","obo:HP_0008527"],"proband":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/94a135f1-a543-4150-850f-a5a7ed6136fa"},"sequencingMethod":{"id":"cg:AllGenesSequencing"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValiditySegregationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":3},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/069c2383-14d1-4c82-b76f-22815ef470a9_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/94a135f1-a543-4150-850f-a5a7ed6136fa"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/86802e37-e2a5-43b9-8538-e104859b4c55_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/86802e37-e2a5-43b9-8538-e104859b4c55_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/736c2b8c-c165-4cff-a374-31d862729d5d","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Gene was expressed in ciliated cells (fallopian tube, testis, bronchus, etc).
