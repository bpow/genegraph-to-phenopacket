{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d29fc405-a0fb-42a8-b8bc-537179e3ace0v1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"COL10A1 was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant metaphyseal chondrodysplasia, Schmid type in 1993 (Warman et al., PMID: 8220429). Schmid-type metaphyseal chondrodysplasia (MCDS) is characterized by short stature and bowing of the long bones. Radiographic features include widening and irregularity of the growth plates, especially in the distal and proximal femora. Twenty variants (missense, in-frame indel, nonsense, and frameshift) that have been reported in 20 probands in 7 publications (PMIDs: 8004099, 8220429, 8304336, 20872587, 25542771, 34367232, 36400164) are included in this curation. Most pathogenic variants cluster in the NC1 domain of the COL10A1, critical to the trimerization of COL10A1. COL10A1 is not a fibrillar collagen, so glycine tripeptide substitutions are not a known mechanism of disease. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is known to be loss of function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by an animal model recapitulating the phenotype observed in human patients, expression studies in fibroblasts, and biochemical function supporting the role of COL10A1 in the calcification and ossification of the growth plate (PMIDs: 30010889, 32913098, 37197316). In summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between COL10A1 and autosomal dominant metaphyseal chondrodysplasia, Schmid type. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Skeletal Disorders GCEP on the meeting date June 24, 2024 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d29fc405-a0fb-42a8-b8bc-537179e3ace0","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5529304a-e8aa-4e44-a544-6864b8afe78a","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5529304a-e8aa-4e44-a544-6864b8afe78a_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10065","date":"2024-06-28T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5529304a-e8aa-4e44-a544-6864b8afe78a_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10065","date":"2024-06-28T20:10:17.049Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5529304a-e8aa-4e44-a544-6864b8afe78a_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5529304a-e8aa-4e44-a544-6864b8afe78a_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/98d322e6-798c-40e2-836a-05e387030492","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Mice heterozygote (wt/m) and homozygote (m/m) for Col10a1 p.Y632X displayed a robust MCDS phenotype.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5ad62a30-1c3c-477e-87e7-4495ae0fd491","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Both wt/m and m/m mice grew slower than their wt/wt littermates from birth. The differences between wt/wt and both wt/m and m/m mice body weights and endochondral bone growth rates were maintained over the time course of the experiment and were still apparent at 9 weeks of age. The lengths of femur and tibia bones as well as body weight in wt/m mice were intermediate between the wt/wt and m/m values. The inner canthal distance (ICD) between the eye sockets, a part of the skeleton formed by intramembranous ossification, was identical between all genotypes, indicating that the observed skeletal defects in wt/m and m/m mice are specifically related to defects in endochondral bone growth.\nHet and hom mice displayed hip dysplasia.\nExpansion of the cartilage growth plate HZ is the histological hallmark of MCDS. The HZs of tibial growth plates were significantly expanded by 3.5- and 5-fold in 3-week-old wt/m and m/m mice, respectively, compared with their wt/wt control littermates. Such marked expansions of HZ in both wt/m and m/m mice compared with wt/wt mice were also present at birth and were still apparent at 7 weeks of age despite marked reductions in the overall height of growth plates in all genotypes that occur naturally as the animals mature.\nThe MCDS phenotype was shown to be a direct result of increased ER stress caused by intracellular retention of mutated and misfolded collagen X protein within the HCs that disrupts HC differentiation. Immunohistochemical analysis of tibial growth plates in wt/wt mice revealed the expected secretion of collagen X into the extracellular matrix surrounding the HCs. The mutant protein in m/m mice was mainly retained intracellularly with a significantly delayed and reduced collagen X secretion in the lower half of the HZ. wt/m mice displayed an intermediate phenotype with less retention and more secretion particularly in the lower half of the HZ compared with the m/m mouse. Immunostaining for the ER stress-induced chaperones GRP78/BiP and Cysteine Rich with EGF Like Domains 2 (Creld2) was markedly induced in the HCs of wt/m and m/m animals compared with the wt/wt control.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30010889","rdfs:label":"Mouse
