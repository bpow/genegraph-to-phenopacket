{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/70eeb930-0e12-4b99-a664-7990898bb73ev1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"The relationship between *MT-TI* and Leigh syndrome spectrum was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of February 3, 2021. The *MT-TI* gene encodes the mitochondrial transfer RNA (tRNA) for mitochondrial tRNA for isoleucine. Defects of this tRNA lead to impaired mitochondrial translation, which leads to decreased synthesis of mtDNA-encoded subunits of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes I, III, IV, and V and thus impaired OXPHOS enzyme activities.\n\nThe *MT-TI* gene was first reported in relation to maternally inherited Leigh syndrome spectrum in 2004 (PMID: 15121771). Evidence supporting the relationship between *MT-TI* and Leigh syndrome spectrum includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included two variants in 3 cases (1 with m.4290T>C, 2 with m.4296G>A) from 3 publications (PMIDs: 15121771, 21982779, 23395828). Segregation information is scored as case level evidence according to the criteria established by the Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel. Loss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease association is also supported by known biochemical function and functional alteration in non-patient cells (PMIDs: 27977873, 15121771). \n\nIn summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on February 3, 2021 (SOP Version 8).\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/70eeb930-0e12-4b99-a664-7990898bb73e","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/69991755-b62f-42aa-bbe3-30ac10e4311d","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/69991755-b62f-42aa-bbe3-30ac10e4311d_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2022-07-06T18:45:31.957Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/69991755-b62f-42aa-bbe3-30ac10e4311d_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2021-02-03T05:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/69991755-b62f-42aa-bbe3-30ac10e4311d_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/69991755-b62f-42aa-bbe3-30ac10e4311d_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/58d5465f-ec8f-42c9-aefa-68c90fe55ae9","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"As well as a reduction in complex I and IV, the m.4290T>C  variant results in a alteration of translation and assembly of complex IV.
