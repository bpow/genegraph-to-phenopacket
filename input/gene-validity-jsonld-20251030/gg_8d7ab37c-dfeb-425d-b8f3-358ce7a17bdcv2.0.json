DSP was first reported to be associated with palmoplantar epidermis, woolly hair, and dilated left ventricular cardiomyopathy (OMIM #605676).  Rampazzo then described variants in Italian families with arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD) (PMID: 12373648).  It is now known as the second most common genetic etiology of arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) PMID: 30915475.  There have been occasional reports of DSP variants found in patients with HCM, however there is no conclusive evidence of pathogenicity of these variants in causing HCM, and there is no assertions of a disease mechanism despite rare variants being identified (PMID: 34500006). This gene-disease relationship was originally curated by the ClinGen Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy GCEP in March 2017, and was given a classification of  ‘no known disease relationship’ due to the absence of a clear assertion of disease causality in the literature.  Upon recuration, by the Hereditary Cardiovascular Disease GCEP, they conferred a continued lack of supportive evidence for *DSP* in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and therefore updated the classification to DISPUTED. More evidence is needed to either support or entirely refute the role *DSP* plays in this HCM. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hereditary Cardiovascular Diseases GCEP on April 13, 2022.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8d7ab37c-dfeb-425d-b8f3-358ce7a17bdc","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/83a9ea83-5dec-4496-a5d8-9b5fdf9373d7","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"NoKnownDiseaseRelationship","changes":[{"id":"cg:newEvidence"},{"id":"cg:classificationChange"},{"id":"cg:sopChange"},{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"},{"id":"cg:expertPanelChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/83a9ea83-5dec-4496-a5d8-9b5fdf9373d7_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10104","date":"2022-06-30T14:31:30.426Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/83a9ea83-5dec-4496-a5d8-9b5fdf9373d7_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10104","date":"2022-06-22T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"There is no convincing evidence to associate DSP with HCM in either human probands or experimental models.","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/83a9ea83-5dec-4496-a5d8-9b5fdf9373d7_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/83a9ea83-5dec-4496-a5d8-9b5fdf9373d7_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b1d5a109-87a0-419f-afcf-b523b2fbbe65","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"While DSP was expressed in the mouse heart, we considered to not count this evidence as it was the only evidence linking DSP to a cardiac phenotype.","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d673a4cd-1a6e-4cfa-837d-cd21c5f7a9f3","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Desmoplakin protein expression was assessed in purified ventricular cardiomyocytes from DSP-KO mice and wild-type controls.
