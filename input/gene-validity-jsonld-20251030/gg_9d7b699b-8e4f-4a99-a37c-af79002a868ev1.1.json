At least nine unique variants (e.g. missense, nonsense, frameshift, and intronic) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 20 probands in four publications (PMIDs:28411587, 23736855, 28777491, 30168660). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in eight additional family members. This gene-disease association is supported by its biochemical function in myoblast differentiation (PMID: 24788338), its expression in skeletal muscle (PMID: 23626854), and animal models in both zebrafish (PMID: 23736855) and mice (PMID: 23626854). In summary, STAC3 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive Bailey-Bloch congenital myopathy.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9d7b699b-8e4f-4a99-a37c-af79002a868e","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/940572b9-6a5a-4de1-8ee1-6394f589515f","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/940572b9-6a5a-4de1-8ee1-6394f589515f_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10031","date":"2020-09-30T20:58:18.643Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/940572b9-6a5a-4de1-8ee1-6394f589515f_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10031","date":"2020-04-25T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/940572b9-6a5a-4de1-8ee1-6394f589515f_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/940572b9-6a5a-4de1-8ee1-6394f589515f_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/32b9b7cf-ce04-4b46-be80-a54ab0befeff","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The specific expression of Stac3 in mouse skeletal muscle agrees with the human expression reported by The Human Protein Atlas, \"Group enriched (skeletal muscle, tongue)\".","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b58f51fb-9046-4000-ad5a-c24015a6a908","type":"Finding","dc:description":"The authors examined the expression profile of Stac3 mRNA in adult mice by quantitative RT-PCR.
