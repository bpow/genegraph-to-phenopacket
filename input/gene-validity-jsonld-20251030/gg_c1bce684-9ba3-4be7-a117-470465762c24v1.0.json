Two families have been reported with biallelic variants in the gene. These individuals presented with global developmental delay and severe intellectual disability, microcephaly, epilepsy, facial dysmorphism, and variable neurological findings. Serum transferrin studies, carried out for affected individuals in one of the families showed reduced sialylation.\n\nCongenital Disorder of Glycosylation (specifically Congenital disorder of glycosylation, type IIbb, MIM# 606975; also known as COG3-CDG) is the only monogenic disorder asserted to be caused by variants in *COG3*.\n\nTwo different missense variants have been reported, each in one of the two reported families (Duan et al, 2023, PMID: 37711075). The mechanism of disease is unknown but assumed to be loss of function.  (Total points for genetic evidence = 1.5 points)\n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence including the biochemical function of COG3, a subunit of the COG complex, which is important in intra Golgi and Golgi to ER retrograde transport (Zolov and Lupashin, 2005,  PMID: 15728195; Shestakova et al, 2006, PMID: 16420527), protein interaction studies showing physical interaction of COG3 with other COG subunits that have been implicated in CDG (Lees et al, 2010, PMID: 20972446; Ishii et al, 2018, PMID: 29899178), and functional alteration studies in patient and non-patient cells showing defects in retrograde transport (Duan et al, 2023, PMID: 37711075; Pokrovskaya et al, 2011, PMID: 21421995). (Total points for experimental evidence = 5 points).\n\n In summary, there is limited evidence supporting the relationship between *COG3* and an autosomal recessive congenital disorder of glycosylation. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation Gene Curation Expert Panel on September 18, 2024 (SOP Version #11)  \n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c1bce684-9ba3-4be7-a117-470465762c24","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6d2120a6-1287-4cba-9f94-f071f0b1abd4","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6d2120a6-1287-4cba-9f94-f071f0b1abd4_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10135","date":"2024-09-19T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6d2120a6-1287-4cba-9f94-f071f0b1abd4_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10135","date":"2024-09-19T18:07:45.568Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6d2120a6-1287-4cba-9f94-f071f0b1abd4_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f33453fa-1be4-4c17-92a6-62e74cd73088_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d395ecc3-3fd5-40e3-a96c-33378080300f","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1.0,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d395ecc3-3fd5-40e3-a96c-33378080300f_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":" p.(Ser42Pro) resides in the COG3 N-terminus, a long segment of α-helix presumably involving quaternary interactions with the other three subunits, as shown by AlphaFold.\nProband has significant reduction of COG3 protein in fibroblasts.","functionalDataSupport":"Yes"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d395ecc3-3fd5-40e3-a96c-33378080300f_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37711075","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/645b1824-f0d0-4a0a-b9a9-cd6d45b557cc","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_031431.4(COG3):c.124T>C (p.Ser42Pro)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA388097627"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":1.0},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f33453fa-1be4-4c17-92a6-62e74cd73088","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37711075","rdfs:label":"Duan_2023: Family 1, BAB13340 (older sib)","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":4,"allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/645b1824-f0d0-4a0a-b9a9-cd6d45b557cc"},"detectionMethod":"Quad exome sequencing (parents and two affected sibs), followed my confirmation of the variant by Sanger sequencing","firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"Myoclonic seizures at 8 months of age, tonic seizures with cyanosis at 1 year of age; seizures were poorly controlled despite use of anti-convulsant therapy.\nAt 4 years and 6 months, severely microcephalic (head circumference -5 SD), global developmental delay, absent speech, no response to external stimuli.\nDysmorphic facial features included long face, wide-spaced eyes, squint, prominent nose, long\nphiltrum, thin lips with a V-shaped upper lip, and low-set ears (Figure 1C). \nNeurological evaluation revealed nystagmus, quadriparesis, bilateral hand tremors, axial and limb hypotonia, and intact deep tendon reflexes. \nEEG showed frequent multifocal epileptiform activity.\nBrain MRI showed significant cortical volume loss,, bilateral symmetric under-opercularization, delayed myelination for age, thin corpus callosum, and mild cerebellar atrophy with a small vermis.\n\n","previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"Normal 46, XX karyotype.\nMildly elevated lactate level (20.4 mg/dL; nml: 4.5–19.8 mg/dL),\nNormal urine organic acids and ammonia level.\nBiochemical analysis of transferrin demonstrated an elevated ratio of tri-sialo species via Mayo Clinic electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (Fig 2A)\nSignificantly reduced (50% normal) COG3 expression on Western blot of fibroblast protein, when compared to controls and father (Fig 2B,C).
