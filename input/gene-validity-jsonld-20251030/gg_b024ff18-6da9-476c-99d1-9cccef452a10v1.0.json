PET117 was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Leigh syndrome spectrum in 2017 (Renkema et al., PMID: 28386624). The variant reported in this patient is a nonsense variant leading to a premature stop codon. Complex IV deficiency is the disease mechanism for this gene. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in 1 proband with Leigh syndrome spectrum in 1 publication (PMID 28386624). This gene-disease association is further supported by the function of the gene product and interaction with another protein associated with Leigh syndrome spectrum. In summary, there is limited evidence to support the relationship between PET117 and autosomal recessive Leigh syndrome spectrum. This classification was approved by the NICHD U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on May 13, 2019 (SOP Version 6).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b024ff18-6da9-476c-99d1-9cccef452a10","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/69d9bbe0-ba3f-44f0-b340-d6d824cb969f","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/69d9bbe0-ba3f-44f0-b340-d6d824cb969f_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/69d9bbe0-ba3f-44f0-b340-d6d824cb969f_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2019-05-20T19:18:05.361Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/69d9bbe0-ba3f-44f0-b340-d6d824cb969f_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/69d9bbe0-ba3f-44f0-b340-d6d824cb969f_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/76de76bf-6f2b-48ba-a483-69f5d7f1c3cc","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The encoded protein shares a biochemical relationship or function with 2-5 gene products whose dysfunction is known to cause Leigh syndrome receiving an increased score of 1 pt.","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d38ef823-283c-489b-8c05-04c40190663a","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Pet117 mediates coupling of heme a synthesis to the Complex IV assembly process in eukaryotes which was demonstrated in experiments performed in yeast cells (PMID:  27998984). Thus, PET117 falls into the category of a complex IV assembly unit. According to Leigh map, at least 5 other complex IV assembly units (PET100, SCO2, SURF1, COX10, ) have been implicated in causing Leigh syndrome (Rahman et al 2017 PMID: 27977873). Therefore, the function of PET117 is shared with other known genes in the disease of interest. ** Of note, COX15 also falls into the category of Complex IV assembly unit but this evidence is represented under protein interaction.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27998984","rdfs:label":"PET117 Complex IV assembly yeast","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionA"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2d72f702-420a-4101-bdc4-f4d065b8cd44","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The encoded protein interacts with one gene product whose dysfunction is known to cause Leigh syndrome (Awarded 0.5 pts)","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c9af4378-4216-4952-a999-eecb12bf1613","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Mitochondrial lysates from cells bearing chromosomally tagged PET117-Myc (or WT control) expressing vector-borne COX15-FLAG were exposed to anti-Myc-agarose beads to determine whether COX15 and PET117 physically interact. Immunoadsorption of PET117-Myc to the beads led to the specific co-IP of COX15-FLAG, suggesting physical interaction between the two proteins. The observed physical interaction between PET117 and COX15 together suggest that PET117 serves as a stabilizing member of the COX15 complex required to synthesize heme a and/or transfer heme a from COX15 to the maturing Cox1-containing Complex IV assembly intermediate. COX15 has been curated and determined to have a limited association with Leigh syndrome spectrum. Therefore, this interaction provides further evidence in support of PET117 and its asscociation with Leigh syndrome spectrum.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27998984","rdfs:label":"PET117-COX15 interaction","demonstrates":{"id":"obo:MI_0915"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5f733e78-fabb-4543-97a0-bdb33fc59dba","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Evidence showing that protein expression is disrupted in any tissue or cell type and/or evidence expression in the brain.
