Variants in KCNQ1 were first reported in humans with this disease as early as 1997 (Neyroud et al., PMID 9020846). At least 11 unique variants (missense, in-frame indel, frameshift, large deletion, complex rearrangement, etc) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data knockout mouse models, rescue in mice, as well as expression of KCNQ1 in the heart and inner ear (PMIDs: 11226272, 11223304, 26084842, 9020846). The mechanism for disease is homozygous LOF of the KCNQ1 gene causes JLNS though  alterations have also been shown to cause Romano-Ward Syndrome in an AD manner (PMID: 29037160). Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 9 probands in 9 publications (PMIDs 29037160, 27041150, 9020846, 27868350, 25187895, 24206879). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 2 additional family members. In summary, KCNQ1 is definitively associated with Jervell and Lange-Nielsen Syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hearing Loss Working Group on 12/19/2017.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9ef65f77-2623-43f7-b983-a271b8cc37d9","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2cb5cd32-6663-48bc-b8b0-3b9ca34e2cb7","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2cb5cd32-6663-48bc-b8b0-3b9ca34e2cb7_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2022-03-22T19:23:52.688Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2cb5cd32-6663-48bc-b8b0-3b9ca34e2cb7_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2017-12-19T05:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2cb5cd32-6663-48bc-b8b0-3b9ca34e2cb7_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2cb5cd32-6663-48bc-b8b0-3b9ca34e2cb7_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/92990c84-8693-4d0a-925a-dfff0097a7e6","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3de08550-935a-494b-b03d-d75d38ed45f1","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Used immunolabeling in WT mice to show that there was KCNQ1 expresssion and also showed that the KCNQ1 -/- mice did not have any expression of KCNQ1","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26084842","rdfs:label":"Cochlear expression of KCNQ1","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1aa4f45e-fb0a-4c1b-960f-ec7ebe0103de","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/48500414-1dd6-42e9-a965-f4ce5e722b48","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Found expression of KVLQT1 in the inner ear using in situ hybridization","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9020846","rdfs:label":"Cochlear expression of KVLQT1","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/22365d77-6864-436c-a86f-0ebe549cd6a5","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7eb250d8-f623-4556-a40f-0fb254a6ce9e","type":"Finding","dc:description":"USed RT PCR and in situ hybridization to identify KCNQ1 in the vestibular end organs as well as the heart and in a positive control.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11223304","rdfs:label":"Immunocytochemistry KCNQ1","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1a5b2f7b-95df-4375-9976-760b75b882ac","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/619b6acf-0609-4bc1-8a27-b55d0f13f6ec","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Conducted RNA analysis with RNA prepared fomr the hearts of 4 week old wild type, het, and knockout mice and found that there was reducted expression of KCNQ1 in hets and absent in knockouts.
