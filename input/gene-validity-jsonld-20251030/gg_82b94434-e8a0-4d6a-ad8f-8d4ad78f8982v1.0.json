PMID:815819). Authors identified compound heterozygosity for two point mutations in the IGKC gene, resulting in loss of an invariant tryptophan in one allele and an invariant cysteine in the other allele. Both mutations were predicted to abolish formation of stable intradomain disulfide bonds. Deficiencies in immunoglobulin isotypes are primary-immunodeficiencies that are often asymptomatic but can be characterized by recurrent sinopulmonary infections. There are three alleles, Km1, Km1 and 2, and Km3, that segregate at the Km locus in IGKC. The Km1 allele, without Km2, is extremely rare. Greater than 98% of the individuals positive for Km1 are also positive for Km2 (Moraru M et al. 2015, PMID:26179905). Some reported cases of K-chain deficiency present with increased susceptibility to pyogenic infections, while others reveal association with autoimmune diseases. Researchers hypothesize that selective K-chain deficiency may be a common genetic defect, however, only a few cases of have been reported due to the presentation of normal immune response to a variety of antigens and A chains ability to substitute efficiently (Pricop et al. 1995, PMID:7554465). \n\nAt least 4 unique missense variants have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 6 probands in 5 publications (PMID: 815819, PMID: 4117311, PMID: 32278584, PMID: 26853951, PMID: 4132042). In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Antibody Immunodeficiencies GCEP on May 18th, 2021 (SOP Version 8). \n\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/82b94434-e8a0-4d6a-ad8f-8d4ad78f8982","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/017e48b4-45d1-4bba-b51c-0f372dbe3a6d","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/017e48b4-45d1-4bba-b51c-0f372dbe3a6d_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10080","date":"2021-05-18T16:07:22.404Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/017e48b4-45d1-4bba-b51c-0f372dbe3a6d_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10080","date":"2021-05-18T16:06:57.607Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/017e48b4-45d1-4bba-b51c-0f372dbe3a6d_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/017e48b4-45d1-4bba-b51c-0f372dbe3a6d_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f367508f-ca37-4507-ac34-83b485229c13_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"IGKC, CYS194GLY, This cysteine is involved in forming 1 of the heavy-to-light interchain disulfide bridges; its mutation interferes with the κ chain’s folding.","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c2992712-3834-4fd9-8593-d0a0104303d4","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32278584","rdfs:label":"Sadighi 2020 Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":73,"detectionMethod":"Sequencing of IGKC showed that proband was apparently homozygous for a T>G point mutation leading to p.Cys87Gly","firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypes":"obo:HP_0009830","previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"Immunofixation electrophoresis of proband's serum showed the total absence of Igκ.
