{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6a4ad569-ea16-4a1a-abe5-489f3202d9bav1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"*GEN1* encodes an endonuclease that is involved in resolution of Holliday junctions during homologous recombination and double-strand break repair. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, there is no disease associated with *GEN1* in OMIM, and curations to refute or dispute can be split when needed.\n\n**Summary of Case-Control Data: 0 point** \nThis gene-disease relationship has been studied in at least 2 case-control studies at the aggregate or single variant level. In 2021, a large case-control study [BCAC (PMID: 33471991); with more than 48 thousand cases and controls] did not identify a significant association of aggregate loss of function (LOF) variants in *GEN1* and breast cancer. In addition, another case-control study (PMID: 20512659) with smaller populations did not show an association of *GEN1* variants with breast cancer. \n \n**Summary of Experimental Data: 1.25 point**\nWhile case control studies did not support the gene-disease association, there is experimental evidence suggesting the function as a Holliday junction-resolving endonuclease (PMID: 19020614). Wyatt et al. showed that cells depleted of *GEN1* exhibited defects in chromosome segregation and anaphase bridge formation after DNA damage (PMID: 24076221). *GEN1* depletion also showed aberrant centrosome numbers and formation of multiple spindle poles during mitosis (PMID: 23166748). In addition, Sun et al. demonstrated that GEN1 expression is correlated with mammary epithelial cell proliferation and differentiation in various physiological stages (PMID: 24980922).\n \n**Overall Summary:**\nIn summary, given the lack of significant association in large breast cancer case-control studies to date, there is convincing evidence refuting the association between *GEN1* and autosomal dominant hereditary breast cancer, which significantly outweighs the evidence supporting the association. This gene-disease pair was originally evaluated as disputed by the Breast/Ovarian Cancer GCEP on 12/13/2017. This re-curation was approved by the ClinGen Hereditary Diseases GCEP on 6/9/2023 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6a4ad569-ea16-4a1a-abe5-489f3202d9ba","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b8a2aec0-413b-41f2-ba51-e8a71e52cf1a","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b8a2aec0-413b-41f2-ba51-e8a71e52cf1a_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10023","date":"2023-12-21T18:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b8a2aec0-413b-41f2-ba51-e8a71e52cf1a_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10023","date":"2023-12-21T17:05:19.922Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"Given the lack of significant association in large breast cancer case-control studies to date, there is convincing evidence refuting the association between GEN1 and autosomal dominant hereditary breast cancer, which significantly outweighs the evidence supporting the association.","curationReasons":["RecurationFrameworkChange","RecurationNewEvidence"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b8a2aec0-413b-41f2-ba51-e8a71e52cf1a_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b8a2aec0-413b-41f2-ba51-e8a71e52cf1a_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fc1e50fe-119b-4804-b95a-870b91212068","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"No direct connection to breast cancer was identified.","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c4d54bff-0a19-4700-93fb-0a3d72453774","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"GEN1 depletion results in aberrant centrosome numbers associated with the formation of multiple spindle poles in mitosis, an increased number of cells with multi-nuclei, increased apoptosis, and an elevated level of spontaneous DNA damage.
