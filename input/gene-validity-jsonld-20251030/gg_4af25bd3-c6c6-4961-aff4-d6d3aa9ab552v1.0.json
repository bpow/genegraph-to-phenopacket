{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4af25bd3-c6c6-4961-aff4-d6d3aa9ab552v1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"IGLL1 was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive agammaglobulinemia 2 in 1998 (Minegishi Y, et al., 1998, PMID: 9419212). IGLL1 encodes the omega polypeptide chain which associates with the Ig mu chain to form a molecular complex on the surface of pre-B cells. This complex presumably regulates Ig gene rearrangements in the early steps of B-cell differentiation. Biallelic variation in this gene thus results in B cell deficiency and agammaglobulinemia. This gene-disease relationship is supported by both genetic and experimental evidence. Three variants (nonsense, missense, and frameshift) have been reported in five probands (PMIDs: 25502423, 19302039, 27576013, 9419212, and 33178177) and one additional affected family member (PMID: 25502423). A role in disease is supported by the expression of IGLL1 in the relevant tissue of bone marrow, specifically enriched in naïve B-cells (PMID: 2501791) and by an IGLL1 deficient mouse model which recapitulates the block in B cell development seen in patients (PMID: 1591779). In summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4af25bd3-c6c6-4961-aff4-d6d3aa9ab552","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b483cc35-0599-4313-b71a-835cb1096ca5","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b483cc35-0599-4313-b71a-835cb1096ca5_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10080","date":"2021-12-21T13:32:20.444Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b483cc35-0599-4313-b71a-835cb1096ca5_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10080","date":"2021-12-21T13:32:32.379Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b483cc35-0599-4313-b71a-835cb1096ca5_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b483cc35-0599-4313-b71a-835cb1096ca5_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ecda406c-eb92-4aac-bf82-d28c1f587187","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"In the mouse, experimentally introduced defects in λ5 cause a block in B cell development at the transition between the pro–B cell and the pre–B cell stage.
