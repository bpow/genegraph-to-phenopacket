Mutations in ***COG2*** can lead to Congenital disorder of glycosylation (CDG), type IIq. CDGs result in a wide variety of clinical features, such as defects in the nervous system development, psychomotor delay, dysmorphic features, hypotonia, coagulation disorders, and immunodeficiency. The broad spectrum of features reflects the critical role of N-glycoproteins during embryonic development, differentiation, and maintenance of cell functions. Clinical features of CDG-II caused by ***COG2*** are characterized by normal presentation at birth, followed by progressive deterioration with postnatal microcephaly, developmental delay, intellectual disability, seizures, spastic quadriplegia, liver dysfunction, hypocupremia and hypoceruloplasminemia in the first year of life. No supporting segregation information is available, and the disease mechanism appears to be biallelic loss of function. Heterozygous carriers are reportedly unaffected. This gene-disease relationship is supported by the biochemical function of ***COG2***, the protein encoded by this gene is one of eight proteins (Cog1-8) that form a Golgi-localized complex (COG) required for normal Golgi morphology and function. LDLC CHO cells have shown the effects of **COG2** and its restoration capabilities when transfected in the CHO cells (PMID: 21047787, 7962052). Coimmunoprecipitation experiments showed interaction with other proteins in the COG complex, specifically its interaction with ***COG1***, ***COG3***, and ***COG5***(PMID: 11980916). Although additional genetic and experimental evidence is needed to establish a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. A classification of LIMITED was approved by the ClinGen Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation GCEP on 2/7/24 (SOP Version 10)\n\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f6e1f36e-e9e4-40b3-80a7-56866052644f","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/67d145eb-648f-4e00-b53f-9447d650cc3e","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/67d145eb-648f-4e00-b53f-9447d650cc3e_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10135","date":"2024-02-08T13:38:52.717Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/67d145eb-648f-4e00-b53f-9447d650cc3e_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10135","date":"2024-02-07T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/67d145eb-648f-4e00-b53f-9447d650cc3e_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/67d145eb-648f-4e00-b53f-9447d650cc3e_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/64e55bf5-aaa4-48f6-ab91-08c87261a56d","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5a09d6bc-4b93-4e6e-a0e5-376feb1bbe48","type":"Finding","dc:description":"The conserved oligomeric Golgi (COG) complex is involved in intra-Golgi retrograde trafficking, and mutations in six of its eight subunits have been reported in congenital disorders of glycosylation.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7962052","rdfs:label":"LDL deficient CHO cells ","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9e9a9a2b-df5c-4531-b9ea-1621d487ca46","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/553d7a26-9add-4e0e-85c7-0dc5a0c70946","type":"Finding","dc:description":"The study shows how in Cog2 null mutant ldlC cells, the content of sphingomyelin (SM) is reduced to ∼25% of WT cells.
