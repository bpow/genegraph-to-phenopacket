Over 40 unique *TTN* variants (including missense, nonsense, frameshift, and splicing variants) associated with a *TTN*-related myopathy phenotype and autosomal recessive inheritance pattern have been reported in humans. \n\nPer criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found insufficient evidence of a distinct molecular mechanism and wide phenotypic variability between the recessive forms of titinopathies and, therefore, the following disease entities asserted in the literature have been lumped into one disease entity termed \"*TTN*-related myopathy\": limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, (MIM #608807) centronuclear myopathy (not an OMIM entity, note that the histopathological findings observed in affected individuals may not always include internal nuclei and the term congenital myopathy with multiple internal nuclei may be more appropriate to represent this heterogeneity), Salih myopathy (MIM #611705), Emery-Dreifuss-like muscular dystrophy (not an OMIM entity), titinopathy with congenital contractures (not an OMIM entity), minicore myopathy (not an OMIM entity), and distal titinopathy (not an OMIM entity). \n\nEvidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and familial segregation data from 28 probands in 13 publications (PMID: 12145747, PMID: 17444505, PMID: 23975875, PMID: 24105469, PMID: 24395473, PMID: 25772186, PMID: 26392295, PMID: 26581302, PMID: 27796757, PMID: 28040389, PMID: 29575618, PMID: 29691892, PMID: 31660661), extending beyond the maximum score for genetic evidence (totaling 12 points). Additional case-level evidence is available in the literature.  Of note, multiple reported individuals asserted to have a limb girdle muscular dystrophy presentation were evaluated and determined to meet the Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophy GCEP-specified criteria for a limb girdle muscular dystrophy phenotype (progressive weakness in limb musculature (pelvic and shoulder girdle), independent ambulation by the age 2 years, elevated creatine kinase of >2X the upper limit of normal, muscle biopsy with dystrophic and myopathic features): PMID: 12145747; Proband V-3, PMID: 26392295. \n\nThis gene-disease association is also supported by experimental evidence, including expression (PMID: 16949617, PMID: 29598826), biochemical function (PMID: 20551232), protein interactions (PMID: 8537379) and multiple animal models (mouse and zebrafish; PMID: 12464612, PMID: 27836965, PMID: 30700140) supporting the role of *TTN* in the assembly and function of the sarcomere (totaling 6 points). \n\nIn summary, *TTN* is definitively associated with autosomal recessive *TTN*-related myopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Congenital Myopathies Gene Curation Expert Panel on 8/23/2021 and by the ClinGen Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophy Gene Curation Expert Panel (secondary contributor to this curation) on 1/11/2022 (SOP Version 7).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/407da8a2-2efa-42bf-a2bc-1ff120da545f","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/41ead80d-f134-43e5-9373-ac55bdcfc0a1","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/41ead80d-f134-43e5-9373-ac55bdcfc0a1_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10031","date":"2022-01-11T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/41ead80d-f134-43e5-9373-ac55bdcfc0a1_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10031","date":"2023-11-08T19:16:19.521Z","role":"Publisher"},{"agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10061","role":"SecondaryContributor"}],"curationReasons":["ErrorClarification"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/41ead80d-f134-43e5-9373-ac55bdcfc0a1_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4eb059a3-15de-4b78-9cab-4b7796efdee2_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4eb059a3-15de-4b78-9cab-4b7796efdee2","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29691892","rdfs:label":"Family 6 Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDeath","ageUnit":"Days","ageValue":1,"allele":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5e23c1f4-615e-4ccc-b18c-22f7e6326c89","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001267550.2(TTN):c.66769+4_66769+7del","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA235089"}},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3673247c-812e-41c7-9181-62692dcff6db","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001267550.2(TTN):c.23692_23693del (p.Met7898AspfsTer44)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA2017999291"}}],"detectionMethod":"The TTN variants of interest were identified by a next generation sequencing panel and confirmed by Sanger sequencing in the proband and the proband's parents.\n","firstTestingMethod":"Next generation sequencing panels","phenotypeFreeText":"Significant fiber size variation was noted in an antemortem quadriceps biopsy taken on day 1.

A quadriceps muscle biopsy at 6 months showed muscular tissue with an altered architectural pattern, increased connective tissue in the endomysium and perimysium, and isolated adipocytes in the perimysium. Muscle fibers showed marked variability in size with the presence of randomly distributed hypertrophic, hypotrophic, and atrophic fibers and occasional internal central myonuclei. Staining with modified Gomori trichrome showed fuchsinophilic aggregates in small fibers and cytoplasmic bodies and reduced NADH TH stain showed isolated oxidative aggregates in subsarcolemmal areas. The fibers presented ill-defined cores with reduced NADH TH and succinate dehydrogenase staining and a diffuse pallor without mitochondrial aggregation was found with cytochrome C oxidase staining. The fibers predominantly showed co-expression of neonatal and fast myosin, but occasional fibers positive for slow myosin were also observed. The inmunohistochemical study for merosin was normal. Electron microscopy at 6 months showed internal myonuclei and disruption of the sarcomere structure with focal streaming of the Z line. The subsarcolemmal area showed replacement of the sarcomeric structure with disorganized filamentous material as well as cytoplasmic bodies. A muscle biopsy performed at 12 months showed severe structural alterations, with extensive adipose replacement in which muscle spindles, intramuscular nerve fascicles, and occasional muscle fibers were identified. At 5 years of age, atrophy was noted to be most prominent in the upper limbs and especially in the shoulder girdle. The atrophied muscles in the legs progressively improved and palpable muscle mass was present at 5 years of age present, although the proband was not able to stand.
