Cernunnos-XLF deficiency is a severe combined immunodeficiency (NHEJ1-SCID) characterized by profound T- and B-lymphocytopenia, microcephaly, growth retardation, and sensitivity to ionizing radiation. At least 9 unique variants (missense, nonsense, frameshift, small insertions, and gross deletions) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level and experimental data.\n\nSummary of Case Level Data: 12.70 points.\n\nVariants in this gene have been reported in at least 13 probands in 6 publications (PMID: 16439204, PMID:12604777, PMID: 24511403, PMID: 20597108, PMID: 30666249, PMID: 28741180). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. \n\nSummary of Experimental Evidence: 4.50 points.\n\nThis gene-disease association is supported by animal models, rescue in patient cells, and protein interaction studies (PMID: 17360556, PMID: 16439205, PMID: 16439204). Using yeast two-hybrid screening and coimmunoprecipitation techniques, Ahnesorg P, et al. (2006), demonstrated that XLF directly interacts with the XRCC4-Ligase IV complex in vitro and in vivo and that siRNA-mediated downregulation of XLF in human cell lines leads to radiosensitivity and impaired NHEJ. Zha S, et al. (2007) used gene-targeted mutation to delete exons 4 and 5 from both copies of the Cernunnos-XLF gene in mouse ES cells. Analyses of these ES cells showed they produce no readily detectable Cernunnos-XLF protein, are highly sensitive to ionizing radiation, and have intrinsic DNA DSB repair defects. Additionally, the Cernunnos-XLF mutations led to increased spontaneous genomic instability, including translocations.\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between NHEJ1 and autosomal recessive Cernunnos-XLF deficiency. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. \n\nThis classification was approved by the ClinGen SCID-CID GCEP on the meeting date May 20, 2021 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2e28b425-1771-49cb-bc8f-9a8a12647896","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/765b118e-c60a-4696-b401-f63b3349d6d2","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/765b118e-c60a-4696-b401-f63b3349d6d2_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10081","date":"2021-05-20T15:12:33.276Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/765b118e-c60a-4696-b401-f63b3349d6d2_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10081","date":"2021-05-20T15:12:48.605Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/765b118e-c60a-4696-b401-f63b3349d6d2_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/765b118e-c60a-4696-b401-f63b3349d6d2_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6cdb5c52-d82c-4306-8815-f5eccc248d31","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Authors conclude that, in mice, Cernunnos-XLF is essential for normal NHEJ-mediated repair of DNA DSBs and that Cernunnos-XLF acts as a genomic caretaker to prevent genomic instability.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9fb596fd-6bc2-4512-b932-dfa96f43b4eb","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Cernunnos-XLF Mutant (CerΔ/Δ) ES Cells were sensitive to ionizing radiation and have DSB repair defects.
