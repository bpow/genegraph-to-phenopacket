These are the only patients and the only variants described so far in thrombocytopenia-10.\n\nThe mechanism of disorder is loss of function.\n\nEvidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes genetic evidences (case-level data) and experimental evidences (expression; functional alteration in patient cells and non-patient cells, non-human model organism).\n\nSummary of Case Level Data: 3 POINTS \nVariants in this gene have been reported in 2 probands in 1 publication (PMID 30591527).\nAffected patients show thrombocytopenia, small platelet volume, bleeding, defective platelet activation in response to convulxin and TRAP-6, defective aggregation in response to collagen, convulxin and TRAP-6.\n\nSummary of Experimental Data: 6.5 POINTS \nSenis et al. showed that PTPRJ is expressed in platelets by flow cytometry and Western blotting (PMID: 20345711) (Expression A). Marconi et al. showed that PTPRJ is less expressed on platelets of patients with variants in PTPRJ (PMID:30591527) (Expression B). They also showed evidence that megakaryocytes cultured from patients with PTPRJ variants show defective proplatelet formation and migration (functional alteration - Patient cells). DAMI cells knocked down for PTPRJ showed impaired migration as well (functional alteration - Patient cells). Finally, they knockdown ptprj in zebrafish and observe thrombocytopenia (Non-human model organism). Senis et al studied a murine model KO for ptprj, the mouse showed prolonged tail bleeding time, compatible with patients bleeding diathesis (PMID: 20345711) (Non-human model organism). In another mouse model, from Ellison et al, the same platelet aggregation defect of patients is shown (PMID: 20345711). \n\nIn summary, we obtained moderate association of PTPRJ with thrombocytopenia-10. However, due to the limited genetic data (only one family described), we will maintain the final classification as limited until more genetic evidence becomes available.\n\nThis classification was approved by the ClinGen Hemostasis Thrombosis Working Group on 11-04-2024 (SOP Version 11). \n\n\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/10f3fd7d-eb6b-4570-a884-98934a6a24ce","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/40b80e00-6e72-405a-af07-f050dae7dac9","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/40b80e00-6e72-405a-af07-f050dae7dac9_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2024-12-18T13:45:24.393Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/40b80e00-6e72-405a-af07-f050dae7dac9_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2024-12-18T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"Due to the limited genetic data (only one family described), we will maintain the final classification as limited until more genetic evidence becomes available","curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/40b80e00-6e72-405a-af07-f050dae7dac9_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7539d05e-9343-4a26-b21b-b7ae0f54bcae_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/71ede880-1049-42ca-8af0-ad93c0718fef","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The variant affects the first nucleotide of\nexon 10, it results in r.1875delG (p.Ser626Alafs7X)","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/71ede880-1049-42ca-8af0-ad93c0718fef_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30591527","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b248b90f-2249-4795-b2fa-322306dc0691","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NC_000011.10:g.48137004del","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA2580617706"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8c6ec8ee-9fc1-4c64-956b-24e02135b401","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The variant affects the splice\nacceptor site of intron 1 and is predicted to cause skipping\nof exon 2 in the messenger RNA.
