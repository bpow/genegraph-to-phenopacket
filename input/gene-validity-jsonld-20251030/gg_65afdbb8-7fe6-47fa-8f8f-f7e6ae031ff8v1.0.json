{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/65afdbb8-7fe6-47fa-8f8f-f7e6ae031ff8v1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"POLD3 was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive immunodeficiency in 2023 (Mehawej C et al., PMID: 37030525).\n\nOverall, 2 patients from unrelated consanguineous families were found to be homozygous for 2 different missense variants in POLD3, (c.29T>C (p.Ile10Thr), and c.1118A>C (p.Lys373Thr). These individuals show growth restriction, developmental delay, hepatosplenomegaly, erythroderma, and susceptibility to respiratory infections thought to be caused by syndromic primary immunodeficiency.\n\nEvidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes expression studies, functional studies, a rescue model, and a mouse model.\n\nCells from the affected patient had lower POLD3 protein levels than controls, suggesting that the c.29T>C (p.Ile10Thr) missense mutation affected protein levels. POLD1 and POLD2 protein expression levels are also decreased in patient derived cells, indicating that DNA polymerase delta complex stability and function are affected by loss of POLD3 protein expression (PMID: 37030525)\n\nPatient fibroblasts show reduced proliferation and lack consistent shape compared to healthy controls, which appears to be caused by cellular arrest at the entry to the S phase, which may be due to a defect in DNA replication.\n\nStaining of patient fibroblasts show increased numbers of γ-H2AX foci which further support the idea that the delayed entry into the S phase is due to problems with DNA replication.\nStaining of CD3+ T cells with the monoclonal Vα7.2 antibody revealed a drastic reduction in the proportion of T cells with a rearranged TRAV1-2 in the patient as compared to healthy controls. Patient T cell receptor β diversity was only 31% of that of a healthy control. This data points to an integral role of POLD3 in maintaining normal T-cell development.\n\nStably overexpressed POLD3 in patient cells with cell cycle delay were rescued through restoration of WT POLD3. These results suggest that the c.1118A>C (p.Lys373Thr variant impacts POLD3 function which causes an impairment in cell cycle progression (PMID: 38099988).\n\nHomozygous mice embryos did not survive. 11% of heterozygous mice experienced dwarfism, problems with brain development, and premature death in the first 10 weeks. Given that brain development is dependent on rapid cell proliferation at specific developmental stages, it is indicated that Pold3 heterozygosity limits the capacity for DNA replication(PMID: 27524497). Homozygous humans also show delayed growth/development and possibly shortened lifespans.\n\nAdult mice with POLD3 deletion show overall low levels of POLD1-3 in B lymphocytes and depletion of POLD3 in lung, kidney, and liver. Pold3 deletion in adult mice caused a generalized accumulation of DNA damage, leading to a severe pathology and ultimately the death of the animal. Homozygous humans show severely decreased expression of POLD3 in Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells and also seem to experience shortened lifespans.\n\nFACS analyses showed that whereas overall DNA replication rates were similar in both cell types, a low dose of APH had a bigger impact in reducing BrdU incorporation rates in Pold3 heterozygous cells. In addition, analyses of fork rate progression in stretched DNA fibers confirmed a higher sensitivity of Pold3+/- cells to APH.\n\nAltogether, this data reveals that POLD3 is haploinsufficient for stabilizing the Polδ complex, which could explain the severe effects of its deficiency in mammalian cells(PMID: 27524497). \nIn humans, however, POLD3 is haplosufficient and heterozygous humans are considered unaffected.\n\nIn summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged.\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/65afdbb8-7fe6-47fa-8f8f-f7e6ae031ff8","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0541ce71-475d-408f-84ad-4fe966a101d6","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0541ce71-475d-408f-84ad-4fe966a101d6_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10081","date":"2025-06-20T16:12:26.444Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0541ce71-475d-408f-84ad-4fe966a101d6_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10081","date":"2025-06-20T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"Per

They imaged and counted fibroblasts after 1, 4, and 7 days in culture. The patient’s fibroblasts grew aberrantly, lacking the consistent shape seen in healthy control fibroblasts. The proliferation of the patient’s fibroblasts was markedly reduced compared to a healthy control over a 7-day period. To determine whether this reduced proliferation seen in the patient was due to cell cycle perturbations, they explored cell cycle dynamics in primary fibroblasts. Following synchronization at the G1 phase, cells were released for 24, 26, or 28 h. Fibroblasts were then labeled for newly synthetized DNA in S-phase cells and stained for DNA content. Results showed a decreased proportion of patient cells in the S and G2 phases as compared to healthy controls at 24 h. To gain more insight into the entry and progression of patient fibroblasts in the S-phase, they performed a similar assay in which cells were synchronized and released for 24 or 48 h in the presence of a microtubule polymerization inhibitor which arrests cells at mitosis and blocks entry into a new cycle so that we could observe a single cell cycle. They saw that patient cells did progress into the S and G2 phases but at a much slower rate than healthy control fibroblasts. At 24 h, a small number of patient cells were in the S phase and even fewer in G2; by 48 h, 1/4 of cells were in G2 but almost 3/4 remained in G1. Hence, it appears that the reduced proliferation in patient fibroblasts is caused by cellular arrest at the entry to the S phase, which may be due to a defect in DNA replication.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38099988","rdfs:label":"Cell Cycle Analysis"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0541ce71-475d-408f-84ad-4fe966a101d6_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5863b19e-afb4-4fa4-bd53-e7ce2845bf16","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3f832755-52e6-4a8c-bbb2-3b397dad276f","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Immunoblots analysis of POLD1, POLD2, and POLD3 in PBMCs from the patient(homozygous), his father(heterozygous), and 2 healthy controls.
