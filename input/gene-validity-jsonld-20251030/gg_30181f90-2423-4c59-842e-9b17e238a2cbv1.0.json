This disease is characterized by onset of recurrent sinopulmonary and deep skin infections in early childhood. Infections are mostly bacterial and patient’s infections usually lack erythema, pyrexia and C-reactive protein (CRP) was absent or at very low levels. All patients presented extremely high levels of IgE, while other immunoglobulins have normal or near normal levels. All cases reported were homozygous for nonsense mutations. The curation of IL6R related to autosomal recessive hyper-IgE recurrent infection syndrome 5 with MONDO ID 0030069 includes both case-level and experimental Six cases in total were found with different missense and nonsense mutations (PMIDs: 31235509, 31778705). A score of 3.2 points for genetic evidence has been reached.\nThis gene-disease association is also supported by expression and rescue models (PMID: 31778705). Minimal IL6R expression was observed on patients’ cells, as was a notable reduction in expression by heterozygous parental cells compared with those from healthy control subjects. Lack of IL6-induced STAT3 activation in patients' EBV B-cell lines was rescued by incubating patients’ EBV B-cells with recombinant soluble IL6R (sIL6R) complexed with IL6. A score of 1.5 points for experimental evidence has been reached, increasing the total score to 4.7 points. In summary, IL6R has a limited association with autosomal recessive hyper-IgE recurrent infection syndrome 5. More cases and research will be needed to elevate the classification. This classification was approved by the ClinGen SCID/CID GCEP on the meeting date September 21, 2023 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/30181f90-2423-4c59-842e-9b17e238a2cb","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d3eaf66b-3d62-4789-8de9-151a56ff5632","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d3eaf66b-3d62-4789-8de9-151a56ff5632_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10081","date":"2023-09-21T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d3eaf66b-3d62-4789-8de9-151a56ff5632_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10081","date":"2024-02-06T18:46:27.723Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d3eaf66b-3d62-4789-8de9-151a56ff5632_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cb15cee1-a1b5-41cd-9567-0b211a64cfa2_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d4fd97c8-80be-4280-883c-12f2d6faa377","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"No consanguinity within family reported but likely same origin as Family 1.","calculatedScore":0.2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d4fd97c8-80be-4280-883c-12f2d6faa377_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"There is functional data but was already used for patient F1P1 of Family 1.","functionalDataSupport":"No"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d4fd97c8-80be-4280-883c-12f2d6faa377_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31778705","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/759192ea-0c95-41a3-8de8-4b1e76c310cd","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000565.4(IL6R):c.494G>C (p.Cys165Ser)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA342610734"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":0.2},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cb15cee1-a1b5-41cd-9567-0b211a64cfa2","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31778705","rdfs:label":"F2P1","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":11,"allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/759192ea-0c95-41a3-8de8-4b1e76c310cd"},"detectionMethod":"WES was done in family 1, individual F1P1, and mutation found was confirmed in this family by Sanger sequencing.","firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"Swelling over the sternum without fever.
