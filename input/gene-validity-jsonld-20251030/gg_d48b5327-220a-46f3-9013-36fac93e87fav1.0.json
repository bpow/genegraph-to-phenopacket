This initial report included a large consanguineous family with 10 affected individuals, 4 of them were genetically studied, and found to have homozygous IVS8+1G>A (c.580+1G>A). Linkage study of this family identified a candidate region on 7q35-q36.1, with a maximum multipoint LOD score of 4.87. Targeted sequencing of *CDK5* was followed by exome sequencing of one affected individual to identify the variant. RNA and protein studies using the fibroblasts of an affected individual confirmed a lack of wild-type *CDK5* RNA and protein products. A knockout mouse model (PMID: 8855328), CRISPR/Cas9-based knockdown of *Cdk5* in the ferret brain (PMID: 28854363) and a functional study of the role of Cdk5 on another lissencephaly gene, *Dcx* (PMID: 14741103) were scored as functional evidence. In total, it was interpreted that there is moderate level of evidence to suggest that  the*CDK5* gene is related to to lissencephaly 7 with cerebellar hypoplasia. This curation was approved by the Brain Malformation Panel on 07/11/2023.\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d48b5327-220a-46f3-9013-36fac93e87fa","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2f6ba2ff-6567-493e-bf39-f05c03013e20","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2f6ba2ff-6567-493e-bf39-f05c03013e20_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10020","date":"2024-04-29T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2f6ba2ff-6567-493e-bf39-f05c03013e20_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10020","date":"2024-04-29T14:00:00.384Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2f6ba2ff-6567-493e-bf39-f05c03013e20_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2f6ba2ff-6567-493e-bf39-f05c03013e20_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/35cd3afe-ea53-4da0-bf73-161699099d75","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0efeabb8-691c-4c6f-8d7c-a803cdc77560","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Reduced gyri and neuronal migration abnormalities are seen in both these model ferrets and humans.
