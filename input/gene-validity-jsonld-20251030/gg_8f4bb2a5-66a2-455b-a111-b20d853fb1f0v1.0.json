Fraser Syndrome is a rare congenital malformation\ntypically characterized by eye anomalies (unilateral or bilateral cryptophthalmos, microphthalmos/anophthalmos), renal agenesis, bladder atresia/hypoplasia, genital anomalies \n(ambiguous genitalia, cryptorchidism, underdevelopment of male genitalia), and syndactyly. Fraser Syndrome can also cause multisystem anomalies, including craniofacial, cardiac, digestive, skeletal, and respiratory system abnormalities. At the time of this curation, there were no other single-gene disorders associated with this gene. There was some evidence supporting an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern for Fraser Syndrome, which has been curated separately.8 variants (nonsense, frameshift, splice site) that have been reported in 7 probands in 3 publications (PMIDs: 12766769, 16894541, 17163535) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached (if applicable). The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be LOF. This gene-disease association is also supported by animal models and expression studies (PMID: 12766769). In summary, FRAS1 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive Fraser Syndrome 1. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen CAKUT GCEP on the meeting date 10/11/22 (SOP Version 9).  \n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8f4bb2a5-66a2-455b-a111-b20d853fb1f0","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1303854d-356f-4295-85c3-ec2c6cbf6e4b","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1303854d-356f-4295-85c3-ec2c6cbf6e4b_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10070","date":"2023-06-30T14:51:44.561Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1303854d-356f-4295-85c3-ec2c6cbf6e4b_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10070","date":"2022-10-11T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1303854d-356f-4295-85c3-ec2c6cbf6e4b_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/88db6afd-4b81-4598-aa3d-9ac6b4bfc8b7_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e65a71a6-a551-4742-8f29-21c0709d6c06","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Downgrading for conservative scoring of homozygous variants","calculatedScore":3.0,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e65a71a6-a551-4742-8f29-21c0709d6c06_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12766769","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/996b68ed-6abd-45d0-845e-86a2daeef9d4","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_025074.7(FRAS1):c.4271C>G (p.Ser1424Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA115775"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/88db6afd-4b81-4598-aa3d-9ac6b4bfc8b7","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12766769","rdfs:label":"McGregor_Family2_IV7","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/996b68ed-6abd-45d0-845e-86a2daeef9d4"},"detectionMethod":"Homozygosity mapping + designed primers to amplify the 75 individual protein-encoding exons of FRAS1 for direct sequencing.

Expression was also detected in the interdigital spaces at E14.5. \n","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12766769","rdfs:label":"McGreggor_Expression","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionB"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":3}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":6569,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria9","strengthScore":15,"subject":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ReNMCtH4j-s","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0009046","gene":"hgnc:19185","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","websiteLegacyID":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/assertion_1303854d-356f-4295-85c3-ec2c6cbf6e4b-","@context":{"@vocab":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"},"curationReasons":{"@type":"@vocab","@container":"@set"},"GCISnapshot":{"@type":"@id"},"dc:isVersionOf":{"@type":"@id"},"websiteLegacyID":{"@type":"@id"}}}
