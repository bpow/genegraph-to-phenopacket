{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7dbfad5d-1b06-48db-846e-81b7faf29cedv1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"EWSR1 was first reported in relation to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) of undetermined inheritance in 2012 (Couthouis et al., PMID: 22454397). Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found difference in molecular mechanism, inheritance pattern and phenotypic variability. Therefore, the following disease entities have been split into multiple disease entities; amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Ewing sarcoma/neuroepithlioma (OMIM: 612219). The split curation for ALS of undetermined inheritance has been curated separately. Four missense variants that have been reported in four probands in two publications (PMIDs: 22454397, 25299611) are included in this curation. We classified EWSR1 as of undetermined inheritance as we couldn't identify if any variants segregated with disease as parental information was unavailable. We determined that the mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss of function (heterozygous). There were four variants which were evaluated but not scored (G512A, P533L, G585S, Y190F) as their population specific allele frequencies were above the ALS GCEP threshold. One of these variants (G585S) was also present in an individual that was harboring a C9orf72 gene expansion, therefore it is unclear whether this variant contributed to the ALS phenotype. This gene-disease association is refuted by several lines of experimental data. Evidence supporting EWSR1 as being a binding partner of FUS and TAF15 was not scored as technical elements of the experiment were questionable (PMID:23975937). Experiments showing the functional impact of the P553L variant on cytoplasmic localisation in rat and mouse primary neurons was not scored as we determined that this variant was not causal for ALS based on genetic evidence (PMID: 22454397). Furthermore, the levels of retinal degeneration and expression of EWSR1 observed in a Drosophila model system were similar between wild type and mutants (PMID: 22454397). Also, neurodegenerative/ALS-like phenotypes observed in homozygous knockout mouse models (PMID: 29731676) and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (PMID: 25946189) do not adequately reflect the human ALS phenotype as heterozygous missense EWSR1 variants are thought to be responsible. The gene-disease association is supported by in vitro functional assays which implicate soluble wild-type EWSR1 as participating in key ALS associated processes such as aggregation and cytoplasmic localisation (PMID: 22454397). In summary, the evidence supporting the relationship between EWSR1 and ALS has been disputed and no valid evidence remains to support the claim. More evidence is needed to either support or entirely refute the role EWSR1 plays in this disease. This classification was approved by the ClinGen ALS GCEP on the meeting date October 11, 2022 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7dbfad5d-1b06-48db-846e-81b7faf29ced","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4e210cfa-3eb4-4f9b-ad0c-67cfae624029","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4e210cfa-3eb4-4f9b-ad0c-67cfae624029_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10096","date":"2023-03-30T20:34:00.030Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4e210cfa-3eb4-4f9b-ad0c-67cfae624029_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10096","date":"2022-10-11T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"There was no genetic evidence for EWSR1 as all of the variants carried  population-specific minor allele frequencies that were above the threshold to be considered causal ALS variants (0.000005).
