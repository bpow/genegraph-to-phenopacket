SETD2 can also interact with non-histone substrates and methylate microtubules and actin, thereby regulating cytoskeletal functions. *SETD2* was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant *SETD2*-related microcephaly-severe intellectual disability-multiple congenital anomalies syndrome in 2020 (Rabin et al., PMID: 32710489). Affected individuals exhibit severe global developmental delay and intellectual disability, microcephaly, hypotonia, respiratory insufficiency, failure to thrive, similar dysmorphic facial features and congenital anomalies affecting several organ systems. Other findings may include seizures, hearing loss, ophthalmologic defects, and structural brain abnormalities.

No functional studies have been performed and the mechanism of pathogenicity is unknown. Two additional *de novo* missense variants have been reported in two probands (PMID: 37372360) but they are not included in this curation because their pathogenicity remains unclear.\n  \nOf note, SETD2 has also been reported in relation to autosomal dominant *SETD2*-related neurodevelopmental disorder without or with macrocephaly/overgrowth, which was assessed separately.\n\nThis gene-disease relationship is further supported by experimental evidence, including biochemical function and protein interaction studies.
