Three individuals with CHD were identified with CNVs (2 gross duplications and 1 gross deletion), however these CNVs encompass multiple genes near the transcriptional repressor *HEY1*, and thus were not scored (PMID: 27788187). A missense variant was reported in 2 individuals of a family with CHD, however functional assay showed no effect of the variant on transcriptional activity (PMID: 35737725). This gene-disease relationship is supported by evidence of *Hey1* expression exclusively in the atria of the embryonic mouse heart and protein interaction studies with GATA proteins (PMIDs: 10415358, 15485867). No apparent heart defects were observed in the *Hey1* knockout mouse but was seen in two double knockout mouse models (*Hey1/2* and *Hey1/L*) suggesting that the Hey proteins play partially redundant roles during cardiac development (PMIDs: 15107403, 17303760). In summary, the evidence supporting the relationship between *HEY1* and autosomal dominant congenital heart disease has been disputed, and no valid evidence remains to support the claim. More evidence is needed to either support or entirely refute the role *HEY1* plays in this disease. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Congenital Heart Disease GCEP on the meeting date August 6th, 2024 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/91972ae6-9406-4544-95e2-7cb835f27ccf","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/634df453-b9c6-4b52-afc0-516603ef90d0","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"NoKnownDiseaseRelationship","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/634df453-b9c6-4b52-afc0-516603ef90d0_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10130","date":"2024-08-06T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/634df453-b9c6-4b52-afc0-516603ef90d0_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10130","date":"2024-09-10T22:17:09.553Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"There are papers implicating the gene in the disease but the genetic evidence could not be scored, so the EP classified it as Disputed.
