At least 3 variants (2 missense, one nonsense) have been reported. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Meier-Gorlin Syndrome 5 is the only disease entity that *CDC6* is associated with.The mechanism of pathogenicity is reported to be loss of function and variants in this gene that have been reported in at least 2 probands in at least 2 publications (PMIDs: 21358632,  35023948) are included in this curation. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by functional alteration in patient cells (PMID: 23516378). CDC6 also has a similar biochemical function to ORC1 and ORC6 (PMID: 23516378). CDC6 is part of the origin recognition complex (ORC); it interacts with ORC1, ORC4, ORC6, CDT1 (PMID: 11477602). Additionally support for this gene-disease relationship comes from an animal model  (zebrafish; PMID: 28985365).  In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Syndromic Disorders GCEP on the meeting date January 17th, 2025 (SOP Version 11).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9bb5d144-914a-4df7-940c-7e2c44484cdf","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/05b74230-8c08-4dcf-af1a-903a2584baf4","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/05b74230-8c08-4dcf-af1a-903a2584baf4_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10060","date":"2025-01-17T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/05b74230-8c08-4dcf-af1a-903a2584baf4_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10060","date":"2025-04-08T15:17:15.901Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/05b74230-8c08-4dcf-af1a-903a2584baf4_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/05b74230-8c08-4dcf-af1a-903a2584baf4_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/944a8f36-5dcb-4b7d-9f99-a57e8912a019","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/48b3abe9-2443-4c99-b264-a8e6d0f53fb9","type":"Finding","dc:description":"both smaller size in development","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28985365","rdfs:label":"Zebrafish cdc6 hypomorphic mutation causes Meier-Gorlin synd","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/05b74230-8c08-4dcf-af1a-903a2584baf4_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/49598715-08f0-4fc5-a2ce-beee606918bb","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3b5363e5-58ba-4cbf-942e-db981fecb0a9","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"EBV plasmids replication was markedly reduced in ORC1, ORC4, ORC6, CDT1, and CDC6- deficient LBLs compared to control at ** P<0.01","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23516378","rdfs:label":"Stiff - lymphoblastoid cell line experiment"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/05b74230-8c08-4dcf-af1a-903a2584baf4_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6e7c5f37-7d6e-4613-94a0-231389bc2932","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0c9d227a-3dd3-4c46-ae79-d247c8df95fd","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Since ORC1 and ORC6 are also implicated in Meier-Gorlin syndrome, and CDC6 was shown to have similar replication reduction, this evidence can be scored as biochemical function","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23516378","rdfs:label":"Stiff et al.
