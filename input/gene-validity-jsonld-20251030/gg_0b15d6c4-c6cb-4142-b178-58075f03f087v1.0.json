Additional symptoms reporte din humans include Bechet's like syndromes and periodic fever. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in molecular mechanism(s) or inheritance pattern. Therefore, the following disease entities have been lumped into one disease entities, (OMIM: 28011863) Multiple variants (missense, frameshift) have been reported in 5 probands in 4 publications (PMIDs: 28011863, 28011864, 29434583, 32849540) are included in this curation. Significant functional testing was done. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is reported to be loss of function of CD70. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by animal models, expression studies, in vitro functional assays, etc.) (PMIDs: 23269247, 28011863, 28011864, 29434583, 32849540). In summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between CD70 and AR lymphoproliferaiton with immunodeficiency This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.This classification was approved by the ClinGen PIRD GCEP on the meeting date 5/21/24.

In contrast, the same patients’ cells showed normal levels of CD70 proteins by Western blotting using a polyclonal antibody encompassing and extending upstream from the C terminus (Ab3; Fig. 1 E and Fig. 2 E). Next, we tested whether the mutation altered the structure of CD70 sufficiently to impair receptor–ligand interactions. Besides altered epitope binding by Abs, we found no binding of soluble recombinant CD27-Fc to HEK293T cells overexpressing mutant versus WT CD70 (Fig. 2 F). This signal was specific for CD27 as shown by lack of binding to anti-CD5 in WT CD70-transfected cells. The mutant CD70 was expressed to near-equal levels as WT CD70 on transfected cells (Fig. 2, G and H; and not depicted). Together, these data indicate that the mutant CD70 identified in P3 and P4, though expressed, is a loss-of-function variant because of impaired binding to its natural receptor CD27.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28011864","rdfs:label":"Functional Testing for Family 2 Variant "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ec162572-4d17-4420-8b97-6aa710f6e7cb","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2f9c5d17-bd01-44fc-ab05-b23da572c37f","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Histograms showing the decreased binding of probands Bcells to CD27-Fc fusion protein on HEK 293 T cells transfected with an empty expression vector (empty vector) or a vector containing cDNAs coding of either NH2-FLAG–tagged CD70 (CD70) or NH2-FLAG–tagged R179X CD70 (CD70 R179X)","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28011863","rdfs:label":"The R179X mutation in CD70 prevents binding to CD27.
