AP1 is found in coated vesicles in the Golgi compartment, where it mediates the recruitment of clathrin and the recognition of sorting signals of transmembrane receptors. The clinical features in affected males are highly variable and may include hypotonia, intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, seizures, choreoathetosis, microcephaly, and brain malformations such as hydrocephalus, periventricular nodular heterotopia, basal ganglia calcifications, Dandy-Walker malformation, and cerebellar defects.\n\nSeven variants (nonsense and splice) that have been reported in eight probands in five publications (PMIDs: 17186471, 17617514, 18428203, 23756445, 25649377) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is loss of function.\n \nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by biochemical function, protein interactions, and a mouse model. Pathogenic variants in other subunits of the AP1 complex are also involved in neurodevelopmental disorders, including *AP1S1*, *AP1B1*, and *AP1G1*.\n \nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *AP1S2* and X-linked syndromic complex neurodevelopmental disorder. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel on October 20, 2017. It was reevaluated on April 22, 2025 (SOP Version 11). Although new experimental evidence was added, the classification did not change.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/11ee170d-cbe4-4e5a-87a3-50ed6e9f98d8","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9caaaacd-e262-421c-826b-8433848721ff","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9caaaacd-e262-421c-826b-8433848721ff_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2025-04-22T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9caaaacd-e262-421c-826b-8433848721ff_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2025-10-16T18:31:41.312Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["DiseaseNameUpdate"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9caaaacd-e262-421c-826b-8433848721ff_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d8565925-51e8-41c3-a949-0c0174705480","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Nonsense variant located in exon 2 of 6.
