It plays a central role in multiple repair pathways including nucleotide excision repair, mismatch repair, and long-patch base excision repair. Deficiency of *LIG1* leads to a spectrum of clinical features including severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), macrocytic anemia, growth delay, and recurrent infections. At least 13 unique variants (missense, frameshift, and splice-site) have been reported in 10 probands across 6 publications (PMIDs: 1581963, 30395541, 29682684, 36341401, 38896336, 40052222). The mechanism of disease is biallelic loss of function, supported by multiple lines of experimental evidence. Heterozygotes are not known to be clinically affected. Functional alteration in patient-derived fibroblasts demonstrated intermediate sensitivity to ionizing radiation, confirming impaired DNA repair capacity (PMID: 36341401). Additional patient cell studies showed reduced formation of the LIG1–AMP intermediate and impaired nick sealing (PMID: 1581963). In non-patient cells, engineered HEK293T lines expressing mutant alleles (R771W, R641L, E566K) revealed reduced ligation efficiency and accumulation of abortive ligation intermediates (PMID: 30395541). A mouse model expressing a patient variant showed replication defects, increased micronuclei, and tumor susceptibility (PMID: 12124343), while a knockout model was embryonically lethal (PMID: 8696349). Biochemical studies further confirmed that LIG1 dysfunction leads to accumulation of 5′-AMP–DNA and potential double-strand breaks, mechanisms relevant to immunodeficiency (PMID: 35790757). In summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between *LIG1* and autosomal recessive immunodeficiency 96. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/51568827-a8d5-4371-8d57-4d7229ce2306","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f7b33b7e-2161-47f4-a20c-9bd1f735d3f7","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f7b33b7e-2161-47f4-a20c-9bd1f735d3f7_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10081","date":"2025-09-18T14:38:02.178Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f7b33b7e-2161-47f4-a20c-9bd1f735d3f7_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10081","date":"2025-09-18T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f7b33b7e-2161-47f4-a20c-9bd1f735d3f7_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f7b33b7e-2161-47f4-a20c-9bd1f735d3f7_seg_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f0a61648-4c69-4b42-af7a-31ae2393a4be_proband_segregation","type":"FamilyCosegregation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30395541","rdfs:label":"Kindred

In HEK293T cells lacking endogenous LIG1, re-expression of mutant alleles such as R771W, R641L, and E566K revealed distinct functional defects. R771W and R641L retained DNA binding but showed reduced nick ligation efficiency, while E566K exhibited no detectable ligation activity, consistent with a null allele.
