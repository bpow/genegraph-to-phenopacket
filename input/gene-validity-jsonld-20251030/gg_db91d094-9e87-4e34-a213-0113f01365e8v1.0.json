RPS20 was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant dominate Lynch syndrome in 2014 (Nieminen et al., PMID: 24941021). Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found Lynch syndrome (MONDO: 0005835) is the only one disease entity associated with this gene at the time of this curation. This curation is based on this disease entity only. This gene-disease association is supported by genetic evidence (4.5 Points). Three variants (frameshift, splicing, missense) that have been reported in three probands in the first report and two recent publications (PMIDs: 24941021, 32424863, 33193653) are included in this curation. Segregation evidence from PMID: 24941021 is also included to support this gene-disease relationship. In addition, in vitro experiments showed that the RPS20 mutation led to a defect in pre–ribosomal RNA maturation and may further disturb the stabilization of p53 (0.5 Point). In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship of RPS20 and autosomal dominant Lynch Syndrome. This gene-disease pair was originally evaluated as limited by the Colon Cancer GCEP on 06/08/2017. This re-curation was approved by the ClinGen Hereditary Cancer GCEP on 3/22/2024 (SOP Version 10).\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/db91d094-9e87-4e34-a213-0113f01365e8","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/258ec9c5-12bb-4d8b-9bc2-d5747b52660c","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/258ec9c5-12bb-4d8b-9bc2-d5747b52660c_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10023","date":"2024-04-11T22:07:00.596Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/258ec9c5-12bb-4d8b-9bc2-d5747b52660c_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10023","date":"2024-03-22T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["RecurationFrameworkChange","RecurationTiming","RecurationNewEvidence"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/258ec9c5-12bb-4d8b-9bc2-d5747b52660c_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/258ec9c5-12bb-4d8b-9bc2-d5747b52660c_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a9286ec5-ed73-47ec-bdca-10dabf5f2ce7","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5f8e479b-5b08-483c-9757-212efefd0f7c","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"a significant increase of 21S pre-rRNAs (which are distributed in 2 close bands in this cell type), as well as an accumulation of 18S-E pre-rRNAs","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24941021","rdfs:label":"small interfering RNA depletion of RPS20 in HeLa cells"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/258ec9c5-12bb-4d8b-9bc2-d5747b52660c_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/dc862d44-207b-47c3-afb1-8042979fc6d6","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/dc862d44-207b-47c3-afb1-8042979fc6d6_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"RT-PCR targeted toRPS20c.177+1 confirms that the G>A variant interferes with splicing.

Exome sequencing was performed on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform (San Diego, CA) with Roche NimbleGen SeqCap EZ Exome Library 2.0 (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). The probes cover a total size of 44.1 Mb, comprising the whole human exome and more than 20,000 genes. A variant calling pipeline version 2.0 for quality control, short read alignment, variant identification, and annotation were used for the primary analysis of sequence data. Paired-end reads were aligned to the GRCh37/Hg19 human genome build. An algorithm developed at the Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland was used for single-nucleotide variant calling, and Pindel was used for insertion or deletion calling. The minimum acceptable read depth was 7, and the required quality score was 20 for single-nucleotide variants and 50 for insertions or deletions. The coverage depth was 20. After filtering out low-quality variations as well as common and homozygous variants, the individual Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA) files were analyzed by Microsoft Access software to detect variants shared by all 4 family members. As an alternative to the scheme shown in Figure 1B with all 4 colorectal cancer patients expected to be carriers of the same mutation, we also analyzed the data allowing for any one of the individuals to be a possible noncarrier (phenocopy). The latter method showed no additional noteworthy candidates to be considered as susceptibility genes.\n\nGenetic linkage analysis of the core pedigree of F56 was conducted at Ohio State University, taking advantage of microsatellite markers from the Genethon collection (ABI PRISM Linkage Mapping Set Version 2, Grand Island, NY) and at the University of Toronto using single-nucleotide polymorphisms and microsatellite markers from the Marshfield collection (Human Mapping 10K array V2; Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). Parametric multipoint analysis was performed with MERLIN v1.0-alpha (Ann Arbor, MI), using the following parameters: autosomal-dominant mode of inheritance, gene frequency of 0.001, 4 age-dependent liability classes,9 and 4 age-dependent phenocopy rates (0.00, 0.01, 0.03, and 0.05 corresponding to liability classes 1–4, respectively).
