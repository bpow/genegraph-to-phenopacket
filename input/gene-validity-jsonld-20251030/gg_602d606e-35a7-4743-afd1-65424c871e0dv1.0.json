Primary trimethylaminuria is characterized by an unpleasant fishy body odor, similar to that of rotten fish, which results from increased excretion of trimethylamine in the urine, sweat, saliva, and reproductive fluids. Affected individuals appear healthy, with no physical symptoms, but the odor often results in social and psychological issues (GeneReviews, Philips and Shepard, 2015, PMID 20301282). Metabolism of trimethylamine is primarily via N-oxygenation in the liver, catalyzed by flavin-containing monooxygenase 3 (FMO3), which converts it to the non-odorous trimethylamine N-oxide. Trimethylamine is derived from the dietary, via the action of gut bacteria. Severe reduction in the activity of TMO3, caused by rare, deleterious variants in the FMO3 gene, is associated with primary trimethylaminuria. More common FMO3 variants, such as p.[(Glu158Lys);(Glu308Gly)], can moderately affect activity of FMO3 and may cause mild or transient trimethylaminuria (reviewed in Philips and Shepard, 2020, PMID 31317802).\nThe relationship between FMO3 and trimethylaminuria is supported by case-level and experimental evidence. Biallelic variants in FMO3 were first reported in a patient with trimethylaminuria in 1997 (Dolphin et al, PMID 9398858). More than 40 variants have been reported to be associated with trimethylaminuria (FMO3 database, https://databases.lovd.nl/shared/variants/FMO3/unique, PMID 12938085; Philips and Shepard, 2020, PMID 31317802).\nFourteen unique variants (missense, frameshift, and nonsense) in 10 probands from 5 publications were curated (Dolphin et al, 1997, PMID 9398858; Akerman et al, 1999, PMID 10479479; Teresa et al, 2006, PMID 16600650; Treacy et al, 2008, PMID 9536088; Shimizu et al, 2015, PMID 28649550). Further information is available in the literature but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. \nExperimental evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes the biochemical function of FMO3, which is consistent with the biochemical findings in patients (Lang et al, 1998, PMID 9776311; Cashman et al, 1995, PMID, 7720103; reviewed in Philips and Shepard, 2020, PMID 31317802), and fishy-tasting milk and eggs, in cows and hens respectively, homozygous for FMO3 variants (Lundén et al, 2002, PMID 12466292; Honkatukia et al, 2005, PMID 15916878). \nIn summary, FMO3 is definitively associated with trimethylaminuria. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This clinical validity classification was approved by the ClinGen Aminoacidopathy Gene Curation Expert Panel.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/602d606e-35a7-4743-afd1-65424c871e0d","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/18ed3960-c745-46f1-aecc-155e713d6ef5","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/18ed3960-c745-46f1-aecc-155e713d6ef5_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10011","date":"2020-08-14T18:47:18.502Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/18ed3960-c745-46f1-aecc-155e713d6ef5_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10011","date":"2020-09-16T19:23:34.279Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/18ed3960-c745-46f1-aecc-155e713d6ef5_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/18ed3960-c745-46f1-aecc-155e713d6ef5_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ab029626-d656-4a54-ac26-54edad626871","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"While this study provides compelling evidence that p.Arg238Ter in the bovine FMO3 gene is associated with a fishy taint in the mild of Swedish Red and White cows, the detection of the odor was done by smell, and there was no measurement of TMA level.

Purified rabbit FMO2 and eleven heterologously expressed human P450 isoforms were also tested. \nHuman FMO3 was by far the most active isoform (Figure 4). \nHuman fetal liver, adult liver, kidney and intestine microsomes were also screened for TMA oxidation. Only human adult liver microsomes provided substantial TMAO-formation. This is consistent with the expression pattern of TMO3 in humans. Kinetic studies confirmed FMO3 to be a highly efficient TMA-oxygenase at physiological pH.\nBased on these observations, loss of function of FMO3 would be expected to result in an inability to metabolize TMA. This is consistent with the finding of high levels of TMA, and low level of oxidized TMA in individuals with loss of function variants in FMO3.\nNote that the role of FMO3 in the metabolism of TMA has been supported by many studies over the years including analysis of the activity of normal and variant FMO3 in different in vitro systems (e.g. see PMIDs 23567996, 31317802 for review; https://databases.lovd.nl/shared/genes/FMO3)","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9776311","rdfs:label":"Selective metabolism of TMA by FMO3","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/18ed3960-c745-46f1-aecc-155e713d6ef5_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/35414d67-9232-454e-b78f-9d59b1752197_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"This individual, with trimethylaminuria, is compound heterozygous for a nonsense variant, p.Glu314Ter, and a missense variant in FMO3.
