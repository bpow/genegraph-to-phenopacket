Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in molecular mechanism(s) and inheritance pattern for Breast Cancer and Prostate Cancer, which were lumped into the disease entity “CHEK2-related cancer predisposition” (MONDO:0700271) - Autosomal dominant inheritance. The split curation for Ovarian Carcinoma (refuted) has been curated separately. CHEK2 results in low to moderate penetrance for cancer, for which multiple published studies study different cancer types, ranging from single case reports to large case-control analyses[SP1] . In addition to breast and prostate cancer, there is limited evidence for renal, pancreatic, thyroid and gastric carcinoma, for which larger studies are needed (PMID 37490054). The common truncating CHEK2 variant (c.1100del) has been demonstrated to convey colorectal cancer (PMID: 12690581) .\n \nGiven the frequency of CHEK2 variants and the cancer phenotype the curation focuses only on breast and prostate cancer case-control studies for scoring genetic evidence. 8 variants (missense, nonsense and frameshift) evaluated in case-control studies by aggregate variant analyses or single variant analyses are included in this curation (PMIDs 27595995, 33471974, 33471991). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is reported to be loss of function. The gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence (animal models, expression studies and in vitro functional assays) (PMIDs: 12094328, 20434834, 19805189, 34903604). In summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between CHEK2 and autosomal dominant CHEK2-related cancer predisposition. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This re-curation was approved by the ClinGen Hereditary Cancer GCEP on 09/27/2024 (SOP Version 10).\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3a78de35-b688-412c-bb21-9d1e3a7bf0b0","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/49566325-8710-4b72-ad64-79528585223d","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/49566325-8710-4b72-ad64-79528585223d_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10023","date":"2024-11-04T20:52:05.535Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/49566325-8710-4b72-ad64-79528585223d_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10023","date":"2024-11-04T18:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["RecurationNewEvidence","RecurationCommunityRequest","DiseaseNameUpdate"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/49566325-8710-4b72-ad64-79528585223d_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/49566325-8710-4b72-ad64-79528585223d_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9265df6c-c45e-4f78-b85f-ec245831ef03","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6e54dc75-4c2e-427c-affb-4d0308b9d7ef","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Mice homozygous for Chk2*1100delC produced more tumors than wild-type mice, whereas heterozygous mice were not statistically different.

By assessing the activity of human CHK2 to phosphorylate one of its main targets, Kap1, in Chek2 knockout mES cells, 31 missense VUS in CHEK2 were found to impair protein function to a similar extent as truncating variants, while 9 CHEK2 missense VUS resulted in intermediate functional defects. Mechanistically, most VUS impaired CHK2 kinase function by causing protein instability or by impairing activation through (auto)phosphorylation. Quantitative results showed that the degree of CHK2 kinase dysfunction correlates with an increased risk for breast cancer. Both damaging CHEK2 variants as a group [OR 2.23; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.62–3.07; P < 0.0001] and intermediate variants (OR1.63; 95%CI, 1.21–2.20; P ¼ 0.0014) were associated with an increased breast cancer risk, while functional variants did not show this association (OR 1.13; 95% CI, 0.87–1.46; P ¼ 0.378).
