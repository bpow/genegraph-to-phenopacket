Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. One macrothrombocytopenia patient has been reported with two rare *TUBA4A* missense variants in cis (PMID: 30760556). No functional evidence is yet available to support one, or both, variants as deleterious. This gene-disease relationship is supported by its shared function with *TUBB1* as a building block of microtubules. *TUBA4A* has a high level of microtubule incorporation (PMID: 25374358) and expression of *TUBA4A* is particularly enriched in platelet microtubules (PMID: 30760556). Additionally, mice carrying a missense mutation in the Tuba4a gene, displayed macrothrombocytopenia and structural abnormalities in the marginal band of platelets, similar to the patient. In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. There is very limited genetic evidence based and more evidence is needed to support a causal role, however no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship.\n\nOf note, *TUBA4A* has also been implicated in autosomal dominant amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). ALS is a neurodegenerative disorder affecting upper motor neurons in the brain and lower motor neurons in the brain stem and spinal cord, resulting in fatal paralysis. and apparently dominant negative *TUBA4A* variants are suggested to dysregulate neuronal function by disruption of microtubule dynamics and stability. Based on differences in phenotype and proposed molecular mechanisms these disease entiteis have been considered seperately and the relationship to ALS was curated by the ALS GCEP.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/58293224-3722-4fe9-8454-696e49b32c70","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7d595dc4-2fa3-478a-a7b7-ffb499fa2ab7","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7d595dc4-2fa3-478a-a7b7-ffb499fa2ab7_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2023-11-06T14:24:54.298Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7d595dc4-2fa3-478a-a7b7-ffb499fa2ab7_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2023-11-06T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7d595dc4-2fa3-478a-a7b7-ffb499fa2ab7_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b329952f-1f8b-4cb8-9ed1-ec54267f7530","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b329952f-1f8b-4cb8-9ed1-ec54267f7530_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30760556","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ecda109b-4c8a-4c9c-a219-83872231cffc","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_006000.3(TUBA4A):c.[541G>A;547G>C] (p.[Val181Met;Glu183Gln])","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA2573318202"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:AlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Heterozygous"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":0.1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7d595dc4-2fa3-478a-a7b7-ffb499fa2ab7_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7d595dc4-2fa3-478a-a7b7-ffb499fa2ab7_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/21ff4e57-d333-42f5-8915-ea4e93c86292","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8f676f0d-0357-4fba-af1f-2f1d7c4a1f45","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Plt68 mice exhibited decreased platelet counts (a 21% reduction compared with wild-type mice, 943 × 103/μl versus 1,199 × 103/μl).
