Sotos syndrome is characterized by overgrowth, distinctive facial features, and intellectual disability. Other major features include autism spectrum disorder, advanced bone age, cardiac and renal anomalies, brain neuroimaging abnormalities, and seizures. 5q35 microdeletions that encompass the entire *NSD1* gene are a common cause of Sotos syndrome and tend to be associated with more severe learning disability than intragenic pathogenic variants (PMID: 15942875). Over 300 unique pathogenic variants (including missense, frameshift, nonsense, splice, and large deletions) have been reported in ClinVar.\n\nEight truncating variants (frameshift, nonsense, and splice) that have been reported in nine probands in two publications (PMIDs: 12464997, 12525543) are included in this curation. Variants usually occur *de novo* but can be inherited (e.g., PMID: 12525543). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. The mechanism for disease is haploinsufficiency (PMID: 11896389). This gene-disease relationship is also supported by a mouse model and *in vitro* functional studies.\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *NSD1* and autosomal dominant Sotos syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel on October 26, 2018 (SOP Version 6).","The relationship between NSD1 and Sotos Syndrome (autosomal dominant) was evaluated using\nthe ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of 10/15/2018. \n\nVariants in NSD1 were first reported in\nhumans with this disease as early as 2002 (Kurotaki et al. ). \nEvidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level\nand experimental data.\n\nOver 300 unique pathogenic variants (including missense, splicing, nonsense, frameshift and large deletions) have been reported in ClinVar. \nVariants in this gene have been reported in at least 8 probands in 2 publications (PMIDs 12464997 and 12525543). Variants in this gene usually occur de novo but can be inherited (e.g Hoglund et al 2003). Microdeletions that encompass the entire NSD1 gene are a common cause of Sotos Syndrome and tend to be associated with more severe learning disability than intragenic pathogenic variants (Tatton-Brown et al. 2005).\n\nMore evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached.\n\nThe mechanism for disease is haploinsufficiency (Kurotaki et al. 2002).\n\nThis gene-disease association is supported by expression studies and in vitro functional assays.\n\nIn summary, NSD1 is definitively associated with Autosomal Dominant Sotos Syndrome.
