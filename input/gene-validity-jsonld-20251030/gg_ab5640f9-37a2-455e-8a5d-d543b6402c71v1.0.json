This disease entity contains two related conditions, methemoglobinemia type I and type II (MIM#250800), which are primarily differentiated by the severity of their clinical presentation (PMID: 18318771; 34467556). Methemoglobinemia type I is characterized by early onset primary cyanosis and elevated serum methemoglobin. Affected individuals have a normal life expectancy and are often asymptomatic. Methemoglobinemia type II is characterized by the same symptoms as type I, with additional neurological involvement which may include global developmental delay, intellectual disability, progressive microcephaly, and/or generalized hypertonia. Patients with methemoglobinemia type II typically do not survive to adulthood. Serum methemoglobin levels do not necessarily correlate with clinical presentation, nor do variant type or genomic position, complicating attempts at genotype-phenotype correlation. However, biallelic null/truncating variants are generally associated with methemoglobinemia type II, while missense variants may be associated with either presentation (PMID: 18318771). The mechanism of pathogenicity is known to be loss of function.\n\nSeven variants (missense, nonsense, canonical splice site, and splice region) that have been reported in five probands in five publications (PMIDs: 2107882; 7718898; 8874222; 10874300; 15744830) are included in this curation. More evidence representing a larger suite of variant types is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by expression studies, *in vitro* functional assays, physical interactions with other proteins associated with methemoglobinemia, and cell culture models (PMIDs: 18973815, 24450884, 26611738, 29111436, 36441026). \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *CYB5R3* and autosomal recessive methemoglobinemia due to deficiency of methemoglobin reductase. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time with no emergence of contradictory evidence. This classification was approved by the ClinGen General Inborn Errors of Metabolism GCEP on November 22, 2024 (SOP Version 11).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ab5640f9-37a2-455e-8a5d-d543b6402c71","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/aa135949-7d13-41e7-bbee-5cefb3b77774","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/aa135949-7d13-41e7-bbee-5cefb3b77774_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10097","date":"2024-12-13T19:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/aa135949-7d13-41e7-bbee-5cefb3b77774_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10097","date":"2024-12-13T23:29:10.508Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/aa135949-7d13-41e7-bbee-5cefb3b77774_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/aa135949-7d13-41e7-bbee-5cefb3b77774_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d3f463bd-a317-4625-a688-1ffd70def55d","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Score reduced, as these experiments were not performed in a neuronal cell culture model, nor do they directly address the mechanism of neuronal cell death or metHb accumulation in human patients.
