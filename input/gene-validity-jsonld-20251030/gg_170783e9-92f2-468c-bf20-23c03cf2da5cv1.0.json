At least 16 unique variants (primarily frameshift but also missense and nonsense) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data.\n\nSummary of Case Level Data: 12 points\nVariants in this gene have been reported in at least 16 probands in 11 publications (PMIDs: 21455213, 30563700, 23716546, 21177436, 26162409, 19953636, 18946494, 18768433, 15902292, 15575056, 26721895). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 15 additional family members. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached.\n\nThe mechanism for disease is primarily through a dominant negative effect. N-terminal frameshift mutations cause truncation of the 42-kD CEBPA protein and overproduction of a 30-kD which functions in a dominant negative fashion (Pabst et al., 2001 PMID: 11242107). A small set of variants have also been identified near the C-terminal end, in the basic leucine zipper region, which is predicted to disrupt the DNA binding and dimerization of CEBPA.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL EVIDENCE: 4 points\nThis gene-disease association is supported by functional alteration of its biochemical function, its expression, and animal models. CEBPA functions as a myeloid transcription factor, acting as an important mediator of granulocytic maturation (Wang et al., 1999 PMID: 10397723). This is supported by the expression of CEBPA both in normal development and during malignancy (Scott et al., 1992 PMID: 1391942). This role in granulocytic maturation is disrupted by N-terminal frameshift mutations, as observed in non-patient H1299 cells (Pabst et al., 2008 PMID: 18768433). This is supported by mice carrying engineered Cebpa alleles, that specifically disrupt the 42-kDa wild-type protein while allowing expression of the dominant-negative 30-kDa form, which led to development of AML with complete penetrance (Kirstetter et al., 2008 PMID: 18394553).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/170783e9-92f2-468c-bf20-23c03cf2da5c","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4234367e-149b-4f13-9243-341396fb4ccf","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4234367e-149b-4f13-9243-341396fb4ccf_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10023","date":"2019-08-18T15:59:16.225Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4234367e-149b-4f13-9243-341396fb4ccf_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10023","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4234367e-149b-4f13-9243-341396fb4ccf_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4234367e-149b-4f13-9243-341396fb4ccf_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/992303de-f8a9-469b-ae03-c4f1ae3f5400","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"To disrupt translation of p42 from the mouse Cebpa gene, a LoxP-flanked neomycin resistance cassette site was generated in the Cebpa locus between the p42 and p30 initiation codons.

However, CEBPa was absent from both human erythroid (HEL and K562) cell lines, from the B-lineage  cell line (Daudi), and from the T-lineage cell line (Molt-3). The expression of CEBPa in human myeloid and lymphoid  leukemias, was determined using  cryopreserved marrow or peripheral blood  samples obtained from patients  at diagnosis or relapse  (Table 1). Nine of 10 myeloid leukemias expressed this  transcription   factor, whereas CEBPa was  not detected in any of the seven lymphoid leukemias examined. To determine whether C/EBPa is present in normal myelomonocytic cells, a virtually pure population of developing myeloid cells  was  isolated  from human marrow, extracted, and analyzed for C/EBPa by Western blotting (Fig 3C). CEBPa was detected in these cells.To further examine the lineage-specific  expression of CEBPa, cytospins of human marrow were incubated with either normal  rabbit serum  or C/EBPa antiserum, and bound   antibodies  were detected immunocytochemically (Fig 4a and b). The predominant CEBPa staining was in cells  with eccentric, kidney-shaped   nuclei, representing fairly mature granulocytic cells.
