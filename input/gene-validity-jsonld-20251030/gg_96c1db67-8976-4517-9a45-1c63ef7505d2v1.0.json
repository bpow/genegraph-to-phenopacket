{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/96c1db67-8976-4517-9a45-1c63ef7505d2v1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"*TLK2* encodes a serine-threonine kinase involved in chromatin assembly, and DNA replication, transcription, and repair. Although *de novo* variants in *TLK2* had been observed in large-scale sequencing studies of individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders since 2014 (PMIDs: 25363768, 25533962), the first report highlighting *TLK2* variants as a cause of autosomal dominant complex neurodevelopmental disorder was published in 2016 (Lelieveld et al., PMID: 27479843). The disorder is characterized by a highly variable phenotype, including global developmental delay; borderline, mild or moderate intellectual disability; behavioral disorders including autism; gastrointestinal problems; and facial dysmorphism (PMID: 29861108). Other variable features include short stature, microcephaly, abnormalities of skull shape, and seizures.\n\nEight variants (2 frameshift, 1 nonsense, 3 splice, and 2 missense) that have been reported in eight probands in four publications (PMIDs: 25363768, 29861108, 33323470, 34821460) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. Variants occur primarily *de novo* but can be inherited from mildly affected parents. *TLK2* is highly constrained for both truncating and missense variants (gnomAD v4.1.0). The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss of function, as most cases are heterozygous for truncating variants (PMID: 29861108). Reported missense variants cluster mainly in the C-terminal kinase domain; variants localized in this region show a reduction of kinase activity (PMID: 29955062). TLK2 activation requires dimerization through a coiled-coil domain, suggesting that inactive mutants could have a dominant negative effect (PMID: 29955062).\n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence, including *in vitro* functional assays of variants showing impaired kinase activity and decreased autophosphorylation (PMID: 29955062), and protein interactions with CHD7 and CHD8, which are also involved in neurodevelopmental disorders (PMID: 29955062).\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *TLK2* and autosomal dominant complex neurodevelopmental disorder. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Intellectual Disability and Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel on June 5, 2024 (SOP Version 11).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/96c1db67-8976-4517-9a45-1c63ef7505d2","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ecd1054d-80b0-4292-a901-65de788b7820","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ecd1054d-80b0-4292-a901-65de788b7820_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2025-10-19T19:03:19.620Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ecd1054d-80b0-4292-a901-65de788b7820_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10006","date":"2024-06-05T10:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ecd1054d-80b0-4292-a901-65de788b7820_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ecd1054d-80b0-4292-a901-65de788b7820_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/02c680b8-e12d-4bc3-9454-9f312bd4e34a","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/490fd230-b1e8-4780-bb06-2223ab5345db","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Four de novo TLK2 variants reported in individuals with intellectual disability (Lelieveld et al. 2016, PMID: 27479843), NM_006852.6:c.1412A>G (p.His471Arg), c.1487A>G (p.His496Arg), c.1819G>A (p.Asp607Asn), and c.2092C>T (p.Arg698Ter), showed impaired kinase activity.
