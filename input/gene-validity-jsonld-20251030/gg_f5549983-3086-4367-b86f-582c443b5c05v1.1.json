A single disease assertion was identified and curated for PAX9. Seven variants (frameshift, nonsense) that have been reported in seven probands with selective tooth agenesis in three publications (PMIDs: 10615120, 37056289, 36071541) are included in this curation. Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 19 additional family members (Stockton et al., PMID: 10615120). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss of function, though functional data supports a dominant-negative effect for at least one missense variant (Pan et al. 2025, PMID: 40227334). This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence, including expression in relevant tissue, functional alteration in non-patient cells, and two mouse models (PMIDs: 40227334, 17394220, 9732271, 16236760). In summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *PAX9* and autosomal dominant *PAX9*-related selective tooth agenesis. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Craniofacial Malformations GCEP on the meeting date April 17, 2025 (SOP Version 11).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f5549983-3086-4367-b86f-582c443b5c05","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1d09376b-6dac-4175-a048-c1829e75a5ae","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1d09376b-6dac-4175-a048-c1829e75a5ae_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10059","date":"2025-09-25T15:35:25.914Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1d09376b-6dac-4175-a048-c1829e75a5ae_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10059","date":["2025-04-17T16:00:00.000Z","2025-09-25T16:00:00.000Z"],"role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["ErrorClarification"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1d09376b-6dac-4175-a048-c1829e75a5ae_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1d09376b-6dac-4175-a048-c1829e75a5ae_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f5e4a067-af45-41fc-a633-a2dbbfc4a784","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/647931fe-e174-419a-be3b-7c1a8b23ea3b","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Expression patterns of PAX9 were examined in embryonic tooth germ from surgically and medically terminated human embryos of 8th to 14th week gestation.
