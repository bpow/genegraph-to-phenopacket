It is required for kidney tubular cell cytoskeletal structure; renal and cardiovascular development; and for left-right symmetry.  In this initial report, cysts were found first in infancy with no extrarenal manifestations in contrast to biallelic *NEK8* disease (AR).  Biallelic disease is associated with nephronophthisis 9 and renal-hepatic-pancreatic dysplasia 2, where there are cysts in the kidney, liver and pancreas and often extra-renal features.\n\nOnly a few variants have been reported in monoallelic *NEK8* and these are all missense changes that affect the kinase domain. In this initial report, one variant p.Arg45Trp was reported in 10 families, 6 with proven de novo mutations. One other report associated de novo *NEK8* p.Arg45Trp with infantile cystic kidneys [PMID: 36215968]. The mechanism is toxic gain of function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by biochemical function, protein interactions and expression, as well as functional alteration in patient cells, and evidence from a cell culture model and rescue in the cell culture model.\n\nIn summary, there is Strong evidence to support the relationship between *NEK8* and AD polycystic kidney disease. This has been demonstrated in both the research and the clinical diagnostic settings. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Kidney Cystic and Ciliopathy Disorders GCEP on the meeting date 01/08/2024 (SOP Version 10).\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b1ddb239-5621-4ce2-b61d-7c20e14731c9","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/32e19522-798c-4c32-a1f7-0cc42660b510","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Strong","changes":{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/32e19522-798c-4c32-a1f7-0cc42660b510_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10066","date":"2025-04-11T18:26:18.583Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/32e19522-798c-4c32-a1f7-0cc42660b510_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10066","date":"2024-01-08T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["ErrorClarification"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/32e19522-798c-4c32-a1f7-0cc42660b510_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/341f85f5-072a-4d38-bdfd-814d0f38db9b","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/341f85f5-072a-4d38-bdfd-814d0f38db9b_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37598857","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cb5b39f4-55aa-46e7-9de1-e9f901a5e1b8","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_178170.3(NEK8):c.133C>T (p.Arg45Trp)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA398421909"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"No","zygosity":{"id":"cg:Heterozygous"}},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/341f85f5-072a-4d38-bdfd-814d0f38db9b_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"Yes (Nek8 knockout IMCD3 cells expressing NEK8-p.Arg45Trp and NEK8-p.Lys157Gln\nshowed significantly decreased polycystin-2 but normal ANKS6 localization in cilia.
