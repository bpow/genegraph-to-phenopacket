Sphingolipids play a role in many cellular processes and their structural diversity arises from modification of the hydrophobic ceramide moiety, such as by 2-hydroxylation of the N-acyl chain, and the existence of many different head groups. Mutations in this gene have been associated with leukodystrophy dysmyelinating with spastic paraparesis with or without dystonia. FA2H was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive hereditary spastic paraplegia in 2004 (Anderson et al. PMID: 15337768). \n\nFA2H is characterized by childhood to adolescent onset of progressive spastic paraplegia, often presenting with gait disturbances as an early symptom. Additional features include cerebellar ataxia, dysarthria, dystonia, and extrapyramidal signs such as tremors or rigidity. Peripheral neuropathy is common and may manifest as distal weakness or sensory loss. Cognitive decline ranges from mild learning difficulties to progressive dementia, and seizures are reported in some cases. Brain MRI findings typically reveal cerebellar atrophy, particularly in the vermis and hemispheres, along with T2-weighted hyperintensities in the periventricular and deep white matter. Thinning of the corpus callosum is also observed in some patients, and involvement of the basal ganglia or brainstem may be noted. FA2H-related disorders are biochemically characterized by disruptions in sphingolipid metabolism, specifically reduced 2-hydroxy fatty acids in sphingolipids, which are critical for the structural integrity of the myelin sheath. These conditions are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, emphasizing the importance of early diagnosis for management and genetic counseling. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in molecular mechanism, inheritance pattern, or phenotypic variability. Therefore, the single disease entity has been maintained: hereditary spastic paraplegia (OMIM#612319). \n\nThis curation included three missense, two frameshift, one nonsense, and one splice variants reported in eight probands across five publications (PMIDs: 19068277, 37410270, 20853438, 26344562, 20104589). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by animal model experimental evidence (PMID: 21491498).\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between FA2H and autosomal recessive hereditary spastic paraplegia. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Leukodystrophy and Leukoencephalopathy GCEP on the meeting date: 12/04/2024 SOP Version #11. \n\nEvidence summary approved by\nJulie Cohen, 1/23/25\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/88566964-5cd4-4fb6-9477-d1150a8c082c","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d5cb819a-ac27-4e87-9db3-6997c476d871","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d5cb819a-ac27-4e87-9db3-6997c476d871_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10107","date":"2025-01-27T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d5cb819a-ac27-4e87-9db3-6997c476d871_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10107","date":"2025-01-27T17:56:21.850Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d5cb819a-ac27-4e87-9db3-6997c476d871_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d5cb819a-ac27-4e87-9db3-6997c476d871_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/95c140ab-a567-495e-bc83-dfe6fe64fd70","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/60690772-862a-47e6-beac-7a485e844657","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Both exhibit CNS demyelination, highlighting the critical role of FA2H in myelin lipid synthesis and maintenance.

This region of interest, flanked by markers rs28759365 and rs981231, contained 96 known genes and predicted transcripts (Fig 2). \nFA2H was chosen as a likely candidate gene based \non its biologic function in lipid homeostasis. DNA sequencing revealed a homozygous c.460C>T missense mutation in the three affected brothers of the index fam ily, whereas the healthy brother was a heterozygote. This mutation resulted in a homozygous p.R154C substitution in exon 3 of FA2H, implicating this gene for the first time in the pathogenesis of NBIA (Fig 2). \nThe resultant amino acid substitution places a cysteine at the site of a normally highly conserved arginine residue. This transition was predicted to be deleterious by all three modeling algorithms employed (PolyPhen, SIFT, and SNAP), presumably via an effect on protein folding. This nucleotide change was absent in 250 indi viduals of Northern or Southern European descent, consistent with a pathogenic variant.","functionalDataSupport":"Yes"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/71ae4faa-2b83-4a39-9c8b-ee8096536974_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20853438","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/77d2422a-8eaf-4292-a3d9-95555bc31c5a","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_024306.5(FA2H):c.460C>T (p.Arg154Cys)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA259930"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":1.0},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3d10237f-7bab-4ba6-8df8-dd23105abcf3","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20853438","rdfs:label":"Kruer 2010 F1 -
