The onset of this family was in their 40’s and epilepsy was not present. Later, this family was found to be on the milder spectrum of this condition, because families reported after this initial publication had earlier age of onset (7-30 yo) and epilepsy. Typical phenotypes of these probands were psychomotor deterioration, progressive myoclonus epilepsy, and Periodic Acid-Schiff-positive, diastase resistant, and neuroserpin-immunoreactive inclusion bodies called Collins bodies in the brain. For this reason, SERPINI1 is curated for autosomal dominant progressive myoclonus epilepsy. Seven missense SERPINI1 variants that have been reported in twelve probands in nine publications have been included in this curation. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be GOF. Of the twelve reported families, ten had variants with functional studies and/or neuroserpin-immuoreactive inclusion bodies in the brain and were awarded 0.5 pts. Five families received additional 0.5 pts, because the variants were de novo. Four variants were recurrent in nine families, and each received 0.5 pts more. For the large family studied in PMID: 10517635, LOD score of 3.4 was published, resulting in 1 pt for segregation. In total, maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts) has been reached. There was no scorable experimental evidence for this gene-disease association. In summary, SERPINI1 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant progressive myoclonus epilepsy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time.\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3a42ebb1-7593-4093-8dc5-76b1ba58e801","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1b31db78-6595-440d-a3f1-b3b5ca361611","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1b31db78-6595-440d-a3f1-b3b5ca361611_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10005","date":"2022-06-06T01:11:35.780Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1b31db78-6595-440d-a3f1-b3b5ca361611_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10005","date":"2022-06-05T19:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1b31db78-6595-440d-a3f1-b3b5ca361611_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fc9c0748-8865-4a75-b6e8-9ea1da8bf98f","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The variant is recurrent.","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fc9c0748-8865-4a75-b6e8-9ea1da8bf98f_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"Subcellular localization in COS7 cell was changed from ER/Golgi to punctate staining in ER.

Polymerization was assessed by incubating wild-type, Ser49Pro and Ser52Arg neuroserpin at 37 °C or 45 °C and separating the resulting mixture by nondenaturing PAGE. Wild-type neuroserpin had not formed polymers at a measurable rate after 24 days at 0.4 mgÆmL)1 and 37 °C compared with a rate of 5.3 · 10)6 s)1 for Ser49Pro neuroserpin and 7.9 · 10)5 s)1 for Ser52Arg neuroserpin. Same effect was seen at 45C.  Circular dichroism showed an increase in both b-sheet and a-helical structure content of the S52R neuroserpin as determined by the large increase in magnitude of the signal at 216 nm and the small increase at 222 nm. This profile is comparable to that obtained for monomeric Ser49Pro neuroserpin and the polymers of both wild-type and Ser49Pro neuroserpin.

Unlike Wt neuroserpin that is found in ER as well as Golgi, the H338R and G392E neuroserpin was not detected in Golgi. Digestion of proteins labelled with 35S-methionine and -cysteine with endoglycosidase H showed that WT neuroserpin was undetectable in cell lysate after 6h chase, but found in the media. However, there was an intracellular band of 50 kDa in cells transfected with both mutants of neuroserpin that shifted to 45 kDa after digestion with endoglycosidase H showing that it still contained unmodified poly- mannose N-glycans typical of ER proteins. Wild-type neuroserpin in the culture media contained an additional lower band due to pro- teolysis over the 6 h chase period, while both mutant forms of neuroserpin were resistant to proteolysis due to their polymeric conformation. Non-denaturing PAGE showed that WT neuroserpin is present as a monomer in the media, but H338R, G392E, S49P, and S52R neuroserpins formed polymers in cytoplasm as well as media. the polymer specific monoclonal antibody did not detect WT neuroserpin but detected the variant proteins by immunocytochemistry. There was a correlation of accumulation of intracellular neuroserpin and the severity of the disease.

Kinetic constants were: A ka value of 1.2 X 10^4 M^-1 s^-1 and a kd value of 7 X 10^5 s^-1 for WT and 0.3 X 10^4 M^-1 s^-1 and 1.6 X 10^-3 s^-1 for ka and kd, respectively. The stability of the neuroserpin-tPA complex was also assessed by SDS-PAGE. The variant neuroserpin more readily dissociates from tPA. The melting points for WT and variant neuroserpin were measured by monitoring the change in circular dichroism (CD) signal at 216 and 222 nm (data not shown) while increasing the temperature at 1 °C/min. Tm was 56.6 (+-0.3) °C for WT and 49.9 (+-1.2) °C for the variant. The far-UV CD spectra showed that the variant protein takes a different  conformation from the WT protein. The spectra for the native variant protein was similar to spectra after polymerization at 45C for 24 h. The rate of polymerization of WT was independent of protein concentration over the range of 0.25–1 mg/ml but showed a progressive increase at higher temperatures with a maximum value of 1.32 X 10^-4 s^-1 at 45 °C. In comparison, the rate of polymerization at different temperatures was constant for NS(S49P) with a value that was almost 13-fold higher than that obtained for NS at 37 °C. Non-denaturing gel also showed the variant protein makes polymer more readily does does the WT protein.

This seems to be due to ER-associated degradation of S52R and G392E neuroserpin, because three cell lines expressed similar levels of protein when assessed by the pulse-chase analysis. Immunoprecipitation with the 1A10 monoclonal antibody followed by endoglycosidase H digestion showed that there are two different species of neuroserpin that can be differentiated after immunoprecipitation: monomeric wild-type and S52R neuroserpin, which are insensitive to endoglycosidase H diges- tion and run as single bands on non-denaturing PAGE, and polymers of S52R and G392E neuroserpin, which are endogly- cosidase H sensitive and form high molecular mass ladders on non-denaturing PAGE. The trafficking of neuroserpin was then assessed in PC12 cells that were differentiated into neurons by plating on col- lagen and treatment with nerve growth factor prior to the expression of neuroserpin. The distribution of total neuroser- pin was characterized with an anti-neuroserpin polyclonal antibody while neuroserpin polymers were identified with the 7C6 monoclonal antibody. There was strong staining for wild-type neuroserpin in the periphery of the cells and the tips of neurites where it co-localized with chromogranin A, a marker for dense core vesicles. In contrast, G392E neuroserpin was found mainly in the cell body of PC12 cells where it formed punctate accumulations typical of mutant neuroserpin. These inclusions stained positive for both total neuroserpin and neu- roserpin polymers. The analysis of PC12-S52R cells showed a mixture of the staining seen for wild-type and G392E neuroserpin. Wild-type neuroserpin did not co-localize with calreticulin in the ER or ERGIC-53/p-58 in the ER Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) and only some cells showed co-localization with GM130 in the Golgi compartment. G392E neuroserpin co-localized with calreticulin within the ER even when the punctate inclusions were found within the neurites, but there was no co-localization with the ERGIC or Golgi markers. Regulated secretion of neuro- serpin from each cell line upon stimulation with 55 mM KCl for 15 min was assessed. Treatment with Kþ resulted in the secretion of 30% of the wild-type neuroserpin, 20% of S52R neuroserpin (detectable only by ELISA) and no neuroserpin from cells expressing G392E neuroserpin.
