At least five unique missense variants in five individuals with congenital heart disease were reported in a publication (PMID: 25196463). Evidence disputing this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data. None of the five variants reported were scorable, as four were too frequent on gnomAD (MAF> 0.00001) to cause disease and one had an unaffected carrier mother. This gene-disease relationship is supported by expression data and two mouse models (PMIDs: 19187638, 9405689, 14550777). In summary, the evidence supporting the relationship between *NTRK3* and autosomal dominant congenital heart disease has been disputed and no valid evidence remains to support the claim. More evidence is needed to either support or entirely refute the role *NTRK3* plays in this disease. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Congenital Heart Disease GCEP on the meeting date February 6th, 2024 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a0ae6b3c-7fa6-4f82-8f71-fe1d77ccb797","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7ec69048-b11f-41f5-b160-c184ae1d65e6","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","changes":{"id":"cg:classificationChange"},"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7ec69048-b11f-41f5-b160-c184ae1d65e6_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10130","date":"2024-04-01T14:24:38.226Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7ec69048-b11f-41f5-b160-c184ae1d65e6_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10130","date":"2024-02-06T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"No
