(2006). Germline CDKN1B mutations are rare, but nine case level studies have been performed so far with MEN4 patients that have variants in the CDKN1B gene. CDKN1B is a negative regulator of cell cycle progression, and its loss is associated with disease progression and unfavorable outcome in many cancer types. CDKN1B show very low nuclear expression in parathyroid adenoma cells and endocrine pancreatic tumor from MEN4 patients. p27wt inhibits the growth of p27-negative GH3 cells in clonogenic assay while p27W76X does not. Mouse and Rat models have been established to show the development of multiple endocrine tumors with CDKN1B deficiency. All of these types of evidence are consistent with a definitive relationship between the CDKN1B gene and multiple endocrine neoplasia type 4 (MEN4).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fa4073f3-5460-49e3-8041-1cc817c1a9af","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b07f8882-dd5e-4831-9926-f8b4c2a8c265","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b07f8882-dd5e-4831-9926-f8b4c2a8c265_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10023","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b07f8882-dd5e-4831-9926-f8b4c2a8c265_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10023","date":"2018-12-21T15:48:54.477Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b07f8882-dd5e-4831-9926-f8b4c2a8c265_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b07f8882-dd5e-4831-9926-f8b4c2a8c265_ad_null_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4fb85876-6e6c-4eb8-9126-f9af026042fc_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"IHC showed negative p27Kip1 staining (Fig.2, B and C).","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8636b69e-e616-40d4-8a82-de3c2da965d0","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17519308","rdfs:label":"Dutch woman","ageType":"AgeAtDiagnosis","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":46,"detectionMethod":"Genomic DNA was analyzed for germline mutations in the CDKN1B/p27Kip1 gene by PCR amplification and direct sequencing.","ethnicity":{"id":"cg:NotHispanicOrLatino"},"firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypeFreeText":"ORPHA:276152, Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 4","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0011763","obo:HP_0000843"],"previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"This female patient has been diagnosed with three lesions compatible with MEN1: small-cell neuroendocrine cervical carcinoma at the age of 45 yr, ACTH-secreting pituitary adenoma (Cushing’s disease) at the age of 46 yr, and hyperparathyroidism at the age of 47 yr.
