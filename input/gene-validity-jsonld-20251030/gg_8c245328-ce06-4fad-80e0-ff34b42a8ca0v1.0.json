These recessive disorders occur with high frequency among populations that have historically inhabited parts of the world where malaria is endemic. Early publications identified the molecular basis of alpha-thalassemia at the protein level through sequencing of the HBA2 gene product (PMID: 1062801, PMID: 1155453, PMID: 4422784), while the inherited basis was first traced to the *HBA2* locus encoding the hemoglobin alpha chain in 1977 (PMID: 909779). Patients with homozygous deletion of *HBA2* were first described in 1984 (Oppenheimer et al., PMID: 6142152), and subsequent studies reported diverse non-deletional *HBA2* variants (PMID: 6725554, PMID: 6725554). The hemoglobin alpha chain is now known to be encoded by two closely linked loci on chromosome 16, *HBA1* and *HBA2*, with alpha-thalassemia trait caused by deletion or inactivation of two of the four alleles. While many affected cases exhibit a digenic mode of inheritance, this curation of the *HBA2* gene has focused on cases with biallelic disruption of *HBA2* and absence of deleterious variants in *HBA1*. These cases generally exhibit mild to severe anemia, decreased volume of red blood cells, decreased hemoglobin content per red blood cell, reticulocytosis, the presence of abnormal hemoglobin tetramers of gamma-globin chains (Hemoglobin Barts) or beta-globin chains (Hemoglobin H), and/or the presence of erythrocyte inclusion bodies that contain denatured hemoglobin. Splenomegaly, hyperbilirubinemia, and/or history of jaundice can also be present. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping & Splitting Working Group, these cases have been distinguished from other *HBA2*-related disease entities by their mode of inheritance (autosomal recessive), molecular mechanism (biallelic *HBA2* loss-of-function), and clinical presentation (less severe than cases with inactivation of three or four hemoglobin alpha chains). Therefore, *HBA2* has been separately curated for unstable hemoglobin disease, methemoglobinemia, and familial erythrocytosis, each with an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance. The *HBA1* gene has also been curated separately.\n \nEight suspected disease-causing variants have been scored as part of this curation (one complete gene deletion, two stop-loss, three missense, one canonical splice site deletion, and one disrupting the polyadenylation signal within the 3’ UTR). These have been collectively reported in ten probands in eight publications (PMID: 2079430, PMID: 2430881, PMID: 6142152, PMID: 6725554, PMID: 8555062, PMID: 15768554, PMID: 20642339, PMID: 20854116). The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be biallelic loss of *HBA2* function conferred by null and/or hypomorphic variants that reduce alpha-globin accumulation. Eight out of ten probands were homozygous for their respective variants, while two probands were compound heterozygous. Large families with co-segregation of the phenotype with the homozygous genotype have not been found for inclusion in this gene curation. Additional case-level evidence is available in the literature but has not been included in this curation as the maximum score for this category of evidence had already been reached.\n\nThis gene-disease association is also supported by experimental evidence that the expression pattern of *HBA2* across human tissues is highly restricted to the blood (PMID: 23715323). Biochemical studies indicate that *HBA2* encodes the alpha chain of hemoglobin, which binds and releases oxygen as part of its function central to the role of red blood cells in carrying oxygen to the tissues of the body (PMID: 11747442). HBA2 protein interacts with the beta hemoglobin chain encoded by the *HBB* gene (PMID: 6644819), which can harbor variants associated with the closely related condition beta-thalassemia. Cells from an affected patient exhibit altered function of the variant HBA2 protein as it abnormally associates with the membrane skeleton and enhances the mechanical stability and rigidity of the membrane (PMID: 9057661). Patient cells also show destabilization of beta-globin chains and the presence of globin chain precipitates (PMID: 6725554). A mouse model of heterozygous *Hba1* and *Hba2* deletion recapitulates features of the human patients such as decreased volume of red blood cells, the presence of erythrocyte inclusion bodies, and reduced ratio of alpha-globin to beta-globin synthesis (PMID: 7550311). Defects of mice with homozygous *Hba1* and *Hba2* deletion can be rescued with the addition of a human *HBA2* transgene (PMID: 7550311), confirming the relevance of the model to the human disease state.\n\nIn summary, *HBA2* is definitively associated with autosomal recessive inheritance of alpha-thalassemia (MONDO:0011399). This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both research and diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time without the emergence of contradictory evidence, leading to a Definitive classification. This classification was approved by the ClinGen General Gene Curation Expert Panel on June 28th, 2023 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8c245328-ce06-4fad-80e0-ff34b42a8ca0","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ab18a814-6fa8-4dc5-8448-9c2c196e24c7","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ab18a814-6fa8-4dc5-8448-9c2c196e24c7_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10026","date":"2023-06-29T20:10:12.594Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ab18a814-6fa8-4dc5-8448-9c2c196e24c7_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10026","date":"2023-06-28T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ab18a814-6fa8-4dc5-8448-9c2c196e24c7_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ab18a814-6fa8-4dc5-8448-9c2c196e24c7_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2502f01b-48a1-4608-9c1a-9897ccfa50fb","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Although the model recapitulates some features of the human patients, this is a digenic heterozygous model rather than a monogenic homozygous model, resulting in significant down-scoring.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f9476c05-4231-4222-a20d-1332d04f72c7","type":"Finding","dc:description":"The heterozygous state of this model recapitulates features of human patients with biallelic disruption of *HBA2*.
