At least 9 variants (e.g. missense, splice site) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case level data and experimental data including a functional alteration study expressing patient variants in heterologous cell lines and two different mouse models (PMIDs 20619386, 28082680, 28209720, 20951944). CBL-related disorder is a genetic condition caused by pathogenic variants in the Cbl ubiquitin ligase gene, (CBL; HGNC:1541). Due to the proposed mechanism indicating the CBL gene's relationship to the RAS-MAPK pathway and the phenotypic presentation similar to that of the RASopathies, CBL-related disorder should be considered a RASopathy disorder. Though there is a wide spectrum of phenotypic variability, broadly, patients with CBL-related disorder have presented with developmental delay, intellectual disability, neurodevelopmental alterations, prenatal lymphatic anomalies, cardiac malformations as well as vascular anomalies particularly affecting the brain (e.g. Moya-moya arteriopathies), craniofacial features indicative of a RASopathy, hypotonia, feeding difficulties, edema of the legs, musculoskeletal and respiratory thorax abnormalities, ectodermal features including cafe-au-lait spots, immunological and hematological disorders and susceptibility to tumors diagnosed as juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) that is usually self-remitting. Note tumor risk beyond JMML has not yet been thoroughly assessed. Due to the clinical presentation of a broad spectrum of these and other phenotypes in patients with variants in CBL, these conditions are currently defined by experts in reference to the causal gene, CBL (PMID's: 20619386, 25283271, 25358541, 28589114, 28414188, 28343148, 24458550, 29259247, 26911351, 21901340, 25952305). The mechanism for disease is unknown. In summary, CBL is definitively associated with autosomal dominant CBL-related disorder. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen RASopathy Gene Curation Expert Panel on 1/7/2019 (SOP Version 5).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/09b4ecc9-3195-491d-93cf-6bd225d12c6e","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4a1a76fd-7e23-44a7-b2fc-4495bc5d5ee6","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4a1a76fd-7e23-44a7-b2fc-4495bc5d5ee6_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10021","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4a1a76fd-7e23-44a7-b2fc-4495bc5d5ee6_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10021","date":"2019-04-29T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4a1a76fd-7e23-44a7-b2fc-4495bc5d5ee6_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4a1a76fd-7e23-44a7-b2fc-4495bc5d5ee6_ad_dn_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e0bd4c4e-0a7a-40a8-bad6-a2826820b7ad_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"This variant was identified in a de novo case in this study and has also been identified at GeneDx and the Partners Laboratory for Molecular medicine and has been classified as Pathogenic.
