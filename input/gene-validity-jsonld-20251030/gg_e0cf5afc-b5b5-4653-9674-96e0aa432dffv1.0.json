{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e0cf5afc-b5b5-4653-9674-96e0aa432dffv1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a genetically heterogeneous group of disorders, usually beginning in early childhood, characterized by recurrent infections of the upper and lower respiratory tract, randomization of left/right body asymmetry, and subfertility (PMID: 32943623). The PCD phenotype results from structural and/or functional abnormalities of motile cilia and flagella. The most frequently mutated gene (15-24% of Caucasian patients) in PCD is *DNAH5* (Dynein Axonemal Heavy Chain 5) which encodes a subunit of the ciliary outer dynein arms (ODAs) and is essential for force generation during ciliary beating (PMIDs: 11788826, 16627867, 19357118). The *DNAH5* gene was first reported in relation to PCD in 2000 (Omran et al., PMID: 11062149). The specific disease entity, primary ciliary dyskinesia 3, with or without situs inversus is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by homozygous or compound heterozygous mutation in the *DNAH5* gene. *DNAH5* variants were first reported in 2002 by Olbrich et al., (PMID: 11788826). Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found the molecular mechanism and autosomal recessive mode of inheritance to be consistent among unrelated patients, while the phenotypic variability among them appeared to represent a spectrum of disease rather than separate disease entities. Therefore, cases caused by inherited *DNAH5* variants have been lumped into a single disease entity, primary ciliary dyskinesia 3 with or without situs inversus (MONDO: 0012085, OMIM #608644). \n\nEvidence from 17 probands in 2 publications have been included in this curation representing 22 unique variants (3 missense, 5 nonsense, 9 frameshift, and 5 splice site) (PMIDs: 11788826, 16627867). Of note, four of these variants have been identified as founder mutations by haplotype analysis: NM_001369.3(DNAH5):c.10815del (p.Pro3606fs), Clin Var ID: 65636, is found in seven PCD families in Hornef et al., (PMID: 1662786). Similarly, NM_001369.3(DNAH5):c.13338+5G>A, Clin Var ID: 572293, is also likely a founder mutation. This variant was identified in more than one unrelated PCD family (PMID:11788826).  Variants NM_001369.3(DNAH5):c.5563dup (p.Ile1855fs), Clin Var ID: 407241, and NM_001369.3(DNAH5):c.13458dup  (p.Asn4487Ter), Clin Var ID: 350995, have been identified as founder mutations that also occur independently in some families of different haplotype (PMID: 16627867). The mechanism of pathogenicity in *DNAH5* mutations appears to be bi-allelic loss of function. There is an abundance of case-level and case-control level evidence available in the literature, but its inclusion in this curation was not necessary to reach the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points).\n\nThis gene-disease association between PCD 3 and *DNAH5* is also supported by gene expression data.  In situ hybridization analysis of murine *Dnah5* expression in the developing and adult respiratory system of mice shows ciliated epithelial expression in the whole bronchial system (embryonic nasopharynx, larynx, trachea and adult lung) (PMID: 12775878).  This murine expression pattern is consistent with the PCD phenotype of humans with mutations in *DNAH5*. Similarly, murine *Dnah5* is expressed exclusively at the mouse Left Right Organizer (LRO) during early embryogenesis, consistent with the hypothesis that laterality defects (situs inversus) linked to *DNAH5* mutations in humans may result from immotile LRO monocilia with defective outer dynein arms (PMID: 11788826). Distribution of DNAH5 in human respiratory cilia was analyzed by immunofluorescent staining in both healthy control patients and in patients with *DNAH5* mutations. DNAH5 staining is observed throughout the respiratory ciliary axoneme and in the microtubule organizing centers in healthy patients, but is undetectable in the ciliary axonemes of *DNAH5* mutant patients where protein instead accumulates at the microtubule organizing centers (PMID: 15750039). An example of disease phenotypic variability is seen in one patient with compound heterozygous mutations affecting splicing at the 3' end of the gene (C-terminal mutations), where mutant DNAH5 is absent from the distal part of the ciliary axonemes but is still detectable within the proximal part, as well as in the microtubule organizing centers. This pattern indicates that at least one of these C-terminal DNAH5 variants is still targeted to the site of proximally located ODA complexes (PMID: 16627867). \n\nIn addition to gene expression data, there are multiple animal models available to support this gene-disease relationship, including *Dnah5mut/mut* mice that show most of the pathological phenotypes associated with PCD 3 (PMIDs: 11912187, 31638833, 33561200); mouse respiratory epithelial spheroid cells cultures with *Mdnah5* siRNA knockdown that reproduce defects in cilia motility seen in human *DNAH5* variants (PMID: 32823934); and embryonic Xenopus with morpholino *dnah5* knockdown that support the role of dnah5 in the ciliary motility underlying leftward flow during embryogenesis (PMID: 19450574). In summary, there is definitive evidence supporting a gene-disease relationship between variants in *DNAH5* and primary ciliary dyskinesia 3 with or without situs inversus. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Motile Ciliopathy GCEP on December 9, 2021 (SOP Version 8). \n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e0cf5afc-b5b5-4653-9674-96e0aa432dff","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4390dba1-012d-4e08-a841-ffc08ebdc737","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4390dba1-012d-4e08-a841-ffc08ebdc737_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10102","date":"2022-01-07T19:06:07.723Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4390dba1-012d-4e08-a841-ffc08ebdc737_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10102","date":"2022-01-07T20:00:26.092Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4390dba1-012d-4e08-a841-ffc08ebdc737_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4c2f4414-87fd-4015-9b70-6a248b01a8f6_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/21f19bd8-84a0-453a-be2f-a00c9675ebe4","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Down-scoring to 1.5 was performed despite the prediction of nonsense mediated decay or truncation of the protein product, as the persistence of a product has not been tested.

The other variant alters a canonical splice donor site located at the boundary of exon 75 and intron 76. In silico splicing tool, SpliceAI, predicts this variant will lead to splice site donor loss. Immunofluorescent staining of DNAH5 in respiratory epithelial cells from the patient shows that mutant DNAH5 is absent from the distal part of the ciliary axonemes but still detectable within the proximal part, as well as in the microtubule organizing centers. This pattern indicates that at least one of these DNAH5 variants is still targeted to the site of proximally located ODA complexes.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16627867","rdfs:label":"Mislocalization of mutant DNAH5 in PCD patients","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionB"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bca82373-9dfe-4e03-bdf6-6edb30ec87c8","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/77a2d355-ecc7-46e4-9d69-18802a4d522d","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Distribution of DNAH5 in human respiratory cilia was analyzed by immunofluorescent staining in both healthy control patients and in patients with DNAH5 mutations.  DNAH5 staining is observed throughout the respiratory ciliary axoneme in healthy patients. In addition DNAH5 staining is seen in the microtubule organizing centers, the apical perinuclear region and in cytoplasmic compartments that connect the two. Respiratory epithelial cells from patients with ODA defects and homozygous mutations (F373, F658, and UNC7, PMID:11788826) were analyzed by immunofluorescent staining.  DNAH5 proteins were undetectable in the ciliary axonemes of these patients but instead accumulated at the microtubule organizing centers.
