These studies suggest that these patients may possess clinical features of Noonan syndrome (NS). However, patients with additional phenotypes such as hypotonia and severe ID all possess secondary causes of disease apart from RASA1 variation. Therefore, there is no convincing genetic evidence that supports the association of RASA1 and NS. In fact, RASA1 should most likely only be associated with cardiovascular anomalies. RASA1’s association with NS is Disputed. The ClinGen RASopathy Expert Panel found no evidence associating RASA1 with cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome, Costello syndrome, NS with loose anagen hair, or NS with multiple lentigines. This curation was approved by the ClinGen RASopathy Gene Curation Expert Panel on 6/7/18 (SOP Version 5).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a93d144c-c982-4299-b7ea-50da835f2104","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a957c2df-eeec-4bdf-b423-6f1667f66abd","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"NoKnownDiseaseRelationship","changes":{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a957c2df-eeec-4bdf-b423-6f1667f66abd_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10021","date":"2018-06-07T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a957c2df-eeec-4bdf-b423-6f1667f66abd_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10021","date":"2021-03-09T15:49:03.437Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"All patients reported to date have capillary malformations without additional features of a RASopathy that couldn't be explained by an alternate cause.","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a957c2df-eeec-4bdf-b423-6f1667f66abd_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a957c2df-eeec-4bdf-b423-6f1667f66abd_ad_null_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f898365e-04d2-4e16-a691-99e8604d3dea_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"This paper describes a family with a c.1248T>G p.Tyr416X variant that caused capillary malformation-arteriovenous malformation syndrome (CM-AVM).
