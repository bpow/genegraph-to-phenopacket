At least 16 unique variants (largely missense, but also nonsense and frameshift) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 20 probands in 7 publications (PMIDs: 25581430, 25807284, 26102509, 27365488, 27663637, 26522332, 29034503). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 51 additional family members. This gene-disease relationship is supported by the biochemical function of ETV6 as a master hematopoietic transcription factor (PMID: 10514502), it’s functional alteration in both patient (PMID: 27365488, 27663637) and non-patient cells (PMIDs: 25581430, 25807284), as well as a knockdown Zebrafish model (PMID: 25281506) and a conditional knockout mouse model (PMID: 15371326). In summary, ETV6 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant thrombocytopenia 5. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/43c6a888-ffe8-4c4d-a5bc-9384e95861fa","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/92a8c1cb-91c1-45cd-adbe-4180b1f6da7d","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/92a8c1cb-91c1-45cd-adbe-4180b1f6da7d_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2020-01-22T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/92a8c1cb-91c1-45cd-adbe-4180b1f6da7d_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/92a8c1cb-91c1-45cd-adbe-4180b1f6da7d_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/92a8c1cb-91c1-45cd-adbe-4180b1f6da7d_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0f895701-6dcb-433f-aa05-8d6240e20c16","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"As previously observed in null mice (PMID: 9250681) analysis of embryonic development confirmed that ∼95% of homozygous embryos died by E11 with failure of yolk sac angiogenesis. Using the lineage specific conditional KO revealed that bone marrow hematopoiesis is entirely dependent on continuous expression of Etv6. Yet, Etv6 does not function as master regulator in the sense that it directs a hematopoietic differentiation program in a wide spectrum of hematopoietic cells. Rather, it has two independent roles in the context of specific, narrow stages of hematopoietic differentiation. First, Etv6 controls the survival of HSCs so that its disruption indirectly affects the majority of all hematopoietic cells which have limited clonal lifespans and eventually will extinguish without constant regeneration from HSCs. Second, Etv6 is required late in the development of the megakaryocyte lineage, where it presumably acts in concert with transcriptional regulators previously implicated in megakaryopoiesis (Nfe2, Scl, Gfi-1B, Aml1, Gata1, Fli-1, and Fog1; Italiano and Shivdasani 2003) and/or by directly binding ETS motifs known to be critical in megakaryocytic promoters.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/740da13b-f6c9-4db4-9f20-7e3e5a9bf2a4","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Platelet counts were ∼50% reduced compared to controls and megakaryocyte colony-forming cells were fivefold increased, findings consistent with a terminal defect in megakaryocyte maturation, partially compensated for by increased progenitors.
