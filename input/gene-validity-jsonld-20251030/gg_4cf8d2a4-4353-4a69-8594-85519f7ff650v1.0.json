At least 85 unique variants (e.g. missense, nonsense, frameshift, deletion, etc.) have been reported in humans (see http://projects.tcag.ca/lafora).  Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data.  The mechanism for disease is homozygous loss of function (PMID: 21505799).  This gene has not been implicated in any other disease associations.\n \nGENETIC EVIDENCE:\nSummary of Case Level Data: 12 POINTS\nVariants in this gene have been reported in at least 21 probands in 7 publications (PMIDs:  16190947, 12958597, 16529633, 15781812, 22047982, 18256682, 18263761).\nVariants in this gene segregated with disease in at least 38 additional family members.\nOf note, the presence of Lafora bodies by biopsy or on autopsy was considered supporting evidence for the function effect of non-null variants.  More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached.\n \nEXPERIMENTAL EVIDENCE\nThis gene-disease association is supported by (animal models and in vitro functional assays, etc.)\n \nIn summary, NHLRC1 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive Lafora disease. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time\nThis classification was approved by the ClinGen Epilepsy Working Group on 3/3/2020 using  (SOP Version 7).\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4cf8d2a4-4353-4a69-8594-85519f7ff650","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c4dbe715-b897-482d-afeb-b05c0653a79a","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c4dbe715-b897-482d-afeb-b05c0653a79a_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10005","date":"2020-12-28T15:42:06.804Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c4dbe715-b897-482d-afeb-b05c0653a79a_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10005","date":"2020-03-03T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c4dbe715-b897-482d-afeb-b05c0653a79a_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c4dbe715-b897-482d-afeb-b05c0653a79a_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/78af4c84-3759-4158-9247-0c1870d73e13","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Different genetic mechanism, non-fatal disease in this species with easily controlled epilepsy.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b203333d-eb5f-43b8-b7dd-d318e3564b25","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Accumulation of laforin-positive polyglucosan bodies in a number of tissues both neuronal and elsewhere.
