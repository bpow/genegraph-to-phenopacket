The split curation for autosomal recessive hearing loss will be curated separately. Five variants (missense, frameshift) that have been reported in five probands in five publications (PMIDs: 21368133, 25589040, 26648831, 28000701, 35292975) are included in this curation. The mechanism of pathogenicity is unknown. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by mouse models and expression data (PMIDs:22544735, 21368133). In summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged. This gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the Hearing Loss GCEP on 03/20/2018. It was reevaluated on 09/21/2022. A new case with hearing loss (35292975) was scored, but two new mouse model studies were not, due to inconsistent inheritance pattern (PMIDs: 25080593, 31249509) and the classification did not change (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9c14d04a-2211-4580-bcc1-47abcfe108ea","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e25cadf1-752a-495d-aaf2-30565519518a","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","changes":[{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"},{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},{"id":"cg:sopChange"},{"id":"cg:newEvidence"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e25cadf1-752a-495d-aaf2-30565519518a_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2022-09-21T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e25cadf1-752a-495d-aaf2-30565519518a_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2022-11-29T17:24:06.437Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e25cadf1-752a-495d-aaf2-30565519518a_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3a91c599-eaa3-4849-896c-cf4ae3d543b8","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3a91c599-eaa3-4849-896c-cf4ae3d543b8_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26648831","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/883a1f5a-739f-485e-a860-e8780c14059d","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001039213.4(CEACAM16):c.1094T>G (p.Leu365Arg)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA406293304"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:DeNovoAlleleOrigin"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:Heterozygous"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0e3b8459-ef8c-4f67-a264-0333d970e6c0","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0e3b8459-ef8c-4f67-a264-0333d970e6c0_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35292975","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6ed060a9-f87f-4cb3-8619-b6c52b23a4e6","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001039213.4(CEACAM16):c.763A>G (p.Arg255Gly)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA406290603"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Heterozygous"}},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0e3b8459-ef8c-4f67-a264-0333d970e6c0_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"Transfection studies in HEK cells demonstrate increased secretion of the variant protein.","functionalDataSupport":"Yes"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9300a22c-3d98-4742-850b-05bd5fb8e6c2","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9300a22c-3d98-4742-850b-05bd5fb8e6c2_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21368133","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1ecd8972-09ba-4e6e-be74-6bfc55203696","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001039213.4(CEACAM16):c.418A>C (p.Thr140Pro)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/31238"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Heterozygous"}},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9300a22c-3d98-4742-850b-05bd5fb8e6c2_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"All protein functions examined were similar to WT.
