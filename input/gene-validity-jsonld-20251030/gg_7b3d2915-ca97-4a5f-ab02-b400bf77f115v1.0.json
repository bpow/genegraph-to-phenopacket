The PCD phenotype results from structural and/or functional abnormalities of motile cilia and flagella. Ciliary motility is powered by a set of axoneme-specific dynein motor complexes. These large multiprotein complexes are assembled within the cytoplasm by dynein axonemal assembly factors (DNAAFs) before their transport into cilia. Mutations in genes encoding DNAAFs result in the improper cytoplasmic preassembly of dynein chains, causing defects in both inner and outer dynein arms that can result in immotile cilia (PMID: 31624012). The *DNAAF3* (*Dynein Axonemal Assembly Factor 3*) gene was first reported in relation to PCD by Meeks et al. in 2000 as a PCD locus, CILD2, mapped to chromosome 19q13.4 (PMID: 10745040) and was identified and characterized as a cilia related gene (Hs 351852) involved in spermatogenesis by Lin et al. in 2006 (PMID: 17074343). *DNAAF3* (*PF22, C19orf51*) variants were first reported in 2012 by Mitchison et al. (PMID: 22387996). The specific disease entity, primary ciliary dyskinesia 2 is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by homozygous or compound heterozygous mutation in the *DNAAF3* gene. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found the molecular mechanism and autosomal recessive mode of inheritance to be consistent among unrelated patients, while the phenotypic variability among them appeared to represent a spectrum of disease rather than separate disease entities. Therefore, cases caused by inherited *DNAAF3* variants have been lumped into a single disease entity, primary ciliary dyskinesia 2 (MONDO: 0011718, OMIM #606763). \n\nEvidence from 18 probands in 5 publications have been included in this curation representing 24 unique variants (5 missense, 5 nonsense, 9 frameshift, 4 splice site, and 1 in-frame delins) (PMIDs: 22387996, 31186518, 32502479, 33577779, 33479112). The mechanism of pathogenicity in *DNAAF3* mutations appears to be bi-allelic loss of function. There is additional case-level evidence available in the literature, but its inclusion in this curation was not necessary to reach the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points).\n\nOf note, four major isoforms of DNAAF3 are found in NCBI’s RefSeq protein database (PMID: 26553804).  The C-terminal 464 amino acids of these isoforms are identical.  Splicing variants and start codon differences involving the first three exons of the *DNAAF3* gene are responsible for producing 487 (isoform 4), 541 (isoform 3),  588 (isoform 2), and 608 (isoform 1) amino acid proteins.  The MANE Select transcript for *DNAAF3* (NM_001256715.2) is a 2118bp mRNA encoding isoform 3 (PMID: 35388217). There is no published information regarding the significance, if any, of these isoforms in dynein arm assembly or in PCD 2.  Publications used in this gene curation have described pathogenic *DNAAF3* variants in different isoform transcripts. Mitchison et al. (PMID: 22387996) describe variants in isoform 2. Guo et al. and Guan et al. (PMIDs: 31186518, 32502479) describe variants in isoform 1. Shoemark et al. (PMID: 33479112) describe variants in isoform 3. Most of these variants are in the conserved portions of the isoforms, but a few fall in a smaller subset of the isoforms. \n\nThe gene-disease association between PCD 2 and *DNAAF3* is also supported by gene expression data.  GTEx RNA-seq expression studies in reference human tissues show strong expression of *DNAAF3* in lung, testis, and Fallopian tube (PMID: 23715323). This pattern is consistent with the role DNAAF3 is thought to play in the assembly of inner and outer dynein arms in respiratory cilia, sperm flagella, cilia in male efferent ducts, and cilia in Fallopian tubes (PMID: 32943623).  RT-PCR analysis in different human and mouse organs shows expression of *DNAAF3* (HS351582) in human testis and the expression of its mouse ortholog (m247538) in lung, testis, and ovary (PMID: 17074343). The expression of *DNAAF3* in human testis is consistent with the phenotype of male infertility associated with PCD in some patients with *DNAAF3* mutations (PMIDs: 31781811, 22387996).  The expression of murine *Dnaaf3* in mouse lung, testis and ovary parallels the role human DNAAF3 is thought to play in the assembly of inner and outer dynein arms in tissues with motile cilia.\n\nTransmission electron microscopy of cilia cross sections from respiratory epithelial cells of PCD 2 patients (carrying *DNAAF3* mutations) show a loss of both outer and inner dynein arms. Additionally, immunofluorescence to further characterize cilia structure in these cells shows an absence of the outer dynein arm components DNAH5, DNAH9, and DNAI2 and an absence of the inner dynein arm component DNALI1. The absence of these proteins suggests a disruption of outer and inner dynein arm assembly in the airway of these patients. These data are consistent with DNAAF3 assisting in the cytoplasmic assembly of axonemal dynein complexes.\n\nThe cytoplasmic folding and preassembly of dynein arm proteins into larger complexes takes place in a stepwise manner involving interactions with various DNAAFs (PMID: 32943623), chaperones, and co-chaperones (PMID: 31817850). Laser scanning confocal microscopy was used in conjunction with a 3D object-based co-localization algorithm to show that in *Xenopus* embryos DNAAFs concentrate together with axonemal dyneins and chaperones into particles (DynAPs) that form specifically in multiciliated cells (PMID: 30561330). The colocalization of GFP-Dnaaf3 fusion protein with Cherry-Dnaaf2 at DynAPs is consistent with DNAAF3 playing a role in the multistep pathway that assembles inner and outer dynein arm components.\n\nSeveral animal models have been used to understand and support the gene-disease relationship between *DNAAF3* and PCD 2. The *Chlamydomonas* PF22-null mutant carries a mutation in *DAB1* (*PF22*), the *Chlamydomonas* ortholog of *DNAAF3* (PMID: 22387996). This mutant exhibits a phenotype of short flagella, lack of motility and dynein assembly defects, a phenotype consistent with ciliary defects seen in PCD 2. Transformation of pf22 mutant *Chlamydomonas* with wild type copies of *pf22* rescues the pf22 phenotype. Morpholino knockdown of *dnaaf3* in zebrafish similarly disrupts dynein arm assembly and ciliary motility causing phenotypes that include hydrocephalus and laterality defects (PMID: 22387996). While laterality defects are frequently associated with *DNAAF3* mutations in human PCD (PMID: 22387996), hydrocephalus has not been reported as a phenotype for PCD 2 but has been associated with a small subset of other PCD gene mutations (PMID: 32943623). RNAi knockdown and CRISPR/Cas9 knockout of *Drosophila* *Dnaaf3* produce flies that exhibit phenotypes consistent with ciliary/flagellar immotility with loss of both outer and inner dynein arms, and depletion of dynein heavy chains in mutant cilia (PMID: 34553759). Male infertility, immotile sperm, and the loss of auditory/vibration mechanotransduction in Ch neurons in *Drosophila* *Dnaaf3* knockouts are phenotypes consistent with the human *DNAAF3* mutations that result in immotile cilia in multiciliated cells.  \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting a gene-disease relationship between variants in *DNAAF3* and primary ciliary dyskinesia 2. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Motile Ciliopathy GCEP on May 6, 2022  (SOP Version 8).\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7b3d2915-ca97-4a5f-ab02-b400bf77f115","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/40329b6f-2d65-49dd-863b-f79dcd1b5a23","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/40329b6f-2d65-49dd-863b-f79dcd1b5a23_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10102","date":"2022-05-09T15:56:00.823Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/40329b6f-2d65-49dd-863b-f79dcd1b5a23_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10102","date":"2022-05-09T15:57:19.679Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/40329b6f-2d65-49dd-863b-f79dcd1b5a23_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a3bdbf5a-430c-4fbe-8f20-47a450473626_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f7be08b7-debc-4542-be3a-429a6a16357e","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f7be08b7-debc-4542-be3a-429a6a16357e_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"NC_000019.10:g.55161826C>T is a splice site mutation in intron 4 of the DNAAF3 gene, predicted by the SplceA1 algorithm to disrupt the essential acceptor splice site at the highly conserved G residue.","functionalDataSupport":"No"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f7be08b7-debc-4542-be3a-429a6a16357e_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33479112","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bffb118d-b27c-4352-ae51-133eb8aa72c4","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NC_000019.10:g.55161826C>T (GRCh38)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA407456251"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":0.2},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a3bdbf5a-430c-4fbe-8f20-47a450473626","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33479112","rdfs:label":"01-112","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bffb118d-b27c-4352-ae51-133eb8aa72c4"},"detectionMethod":"Next-generation sequencing performed either by whole exome sequencing (WES) or targeted gene panel sequencing (Illumina TruSeq Custom Amplicon, Agilent SureSelect Focused Exome or SureSelectXT custom panel), including all known PCD genes and other candidate genes.\n\nVariants were confirmed by Sanger sequencing with parental segregation.
