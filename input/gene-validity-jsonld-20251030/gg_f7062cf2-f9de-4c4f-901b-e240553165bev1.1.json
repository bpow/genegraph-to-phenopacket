Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found differences in phenotypic variability associated with CFB. The diseases were split into separate entities: aHUS (with autosomal dominant inheritance due to a Gain of Function variant, OMIM612924) and CFB deficiency (due to autosomal recessive disease and two loss of function variants, OMIM 615561). CFB deficiency will be curated by the Immunodeficiency GCEP. The relationship between CFB and aHUS was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework. The CFB gene encodes a single chain glycoprotein that is a component of the alternative complement pathway. It is cleaved by Factor D into fragments Ba and Bb, and the C terminal half of Bb has serine protease activity that cleaves C3 into C3a and C3b. CFB is a circulating molecule, and is expressed mainly in the liver. The clinical presentation of aHUS is with microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia, thrombocytopenia, and renal failure, without a gastrointestinal infection, and often progressing to kidney failure. Eight variants, all missense, have been reported in four publications and are included in this curation (PMIDs: 17182750; 24652797; 32540405; 32540405). Only pathogenic variants due to missense changes in CFB with functional data supporting a gain of function effect are scored here. The same variants reported in multiple possibly-unrelated individuals are not scored separately. However segregation data are available from three families with aHUS and different heterozygous pathogenic variants in CFB for which there is supporting functional data (PMIDs: 32540405; 24906628; 17182750). The gene-disease association is further supported by experimental data from the interaction of CFB with C3 (which is also associated with aHUS), CFB function that is likely to explain the clinical phenotype, as well as in vitro studies demonstrating that the pathogenic CFB variants affect CFB function. In summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Complement Mediated Kidney Diseases GCEP on the meeting date May 17, 2023 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f7062cf2-f9de-4c4f-901b-e240553165be","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ee0e92dc-42db-450e-8e8d-804e5fb4eda8","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","changes":{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ee0e92dc-42db-450e-8e8d-804e5fb4eda8_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10069","date":"2023-09-29T15:49:56.156Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ee0e92dc-42db-450e-8e8d-804e5fb4eda8_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10069","date":"2023-07-02T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["ErrorClarification"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ee0e92dc-42db-450e-8e8d-804e5fb4eda8_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ee0e92dc-42db-450e-8e8d-804e5fb4eda8_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/416d0a9a-4c7e-480a-a393-093dc130046b","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3de2fe1e-3847-4eca-97a9-f7937d6b5490","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Interaction between CFB, C3 and properdin","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3140783","rdfs:label":"Cross-linking with C3","demonstrates":{"id":"obo:MI_0915"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d38431d4-419c-4217-a9be-abea1ce176da","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Have already scored for Biochemical function","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2e097554-bb23-4c4c-b15e-079ffda1cda0","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Mutants associated with RBC haemolysis through alternative pathway activation ","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10072540","rdfs:label":"RBC haemolysis by mutant CFB","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e373bf2b-0574-4679-bf2d-0453ca46beef","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/299283a4-9801-4864-a5fa-2ad76b0e3ade","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Mutant proteins formed by high-affinity C3-binding site leads to hyperfunctional C3 convertase, resistant to decay by factor H.
