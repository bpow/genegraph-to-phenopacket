The specific disease entity, Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (MONDO:0016575), OMIM:603336), is one of at least 45 different primary ciliary dyskinesias distinguished by a single monogenic cause. Some of the most common patient phenotypes are: Male infertility, Immotile sperm, Abnormal sperm morphology, Short sperm flagella, Absent sperm flagella, Coiled sperm flagella, Irregularly shaped sperm tail, Abnormal sperm motility and Abnormal sperm tail morphology. Per the recommendations of the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, the GCEP decided to split and perform separate curations for both gene-diseases entities: One curation for the relationship between DNAH10 and PCD and another one for the relationship between DNAH10 and Spermatogenic Failure 56. This curation is focused on the relationship between DNAH10 and PCD.\n\nTwelve variants: (3 type of genetic mutation: Missense (9), Frameshift (2) and Nonsense (1) that have been reported in 8 probands in 4 publications (PMIDs: 34237282, 34657236, 37314648 and 34791246) are included in this curation. Not all of the probands were scorable for PCD.\n\nMany of the probands sought treatment for their male infertility and were able to successfully conceive a child with their wives. The affected and fertility status of most of the siblings of the probands was unknown.\n\nOverall, the mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss of function as shown by the suspected disease-causing variants in the probands. \n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by multiple forms of experimental evidence such as Expression A (Quantity: 1), Model System: Zebrafish (Quantity: 2), Model System: Trypanosoma (Quantity: 1) and Model System: Mouse (Quantity: 3). First, GTex data showed that DNAH10 is primarily expressed in the Testis, Fallopian Tube and Lung. ProteinAtlas recapitulates that by showing expression primarily in Male Tissues, Female Tissues and Respiratory System. Additionally, Maiti et al. 2000 (PMID: 11175280) shows that DNAH10 is expressed in the Brain, Testis and Trachea. The areas of expression across the GTex, ProteinAtlas and paper are consistent with PCD phenotypes. Wang et al. 2021 (PMID: 34915022) presented a Zebrafish model. Both the model and the probands had immotile cilia and the scoliosis seen in the model is similar to the phenotype of abdominal situs inversus in humans. Next, Zukas el al. 2012 contained a Trypanosoma brucei model where both the model and the probands were found to have immotile cilia. Then, Tu et al. 2021 (PMID: 34237282)  had a knockout and a knockin mouse model. The knockout model demonstrated a variety of phenotypes: Both the model and human probands displayed male infertility. The model had immotile sperm which is similar to the human phenotype of abnormal sperm motility. Additionally, the model showed abnormal sperm morphology which is similar to the abnormal sperm tail morphology found in humans. Finally, both the model and human probands displayed absent sperm flagella, coiled sperm flagella, short sperm flagella and irregularly shaped sperm tails. Wang et al. 2023 (PMID: 37314648) provided further details about the Tu et al. knockout mouse - The model had abnormal ciliary motility which is similar to the human phenotype of abnormal sperm motility and both the model and human probands displayed immotile cilia. Not only that, the model displayed airway cilia and sperm flagellar ultrastructures and mobility deficiency and also recapitulated PCD phenotypes including hydrocephalus, chronic respiratory infection, and male infertility. TEM analysis of airway epithelium cells revealed microtubular disorganization and IDA defect of the ciliary axoneme. The knockin model also demonstrated many of the phenotypes found in human probands: Both the model and human probands displayed male infertility. The model had immotile sperm which is similar to the human phenotype of abnormal sperm motility. Additionally, the model showed abnormal sperm morphology which is similar to the abnormal sperm tail morphology found in humans. Then, both the model and human probands displayed absent sperm flagella, coiled sperm flagella, short sperm flagella and irregularly shaped sperm tails. Wang et al. 2023 (PMID: 37314648) also contained a knockin model. Within the knockin model, both the model and human probands displayed immotile cilia. The model had abnormal ciliary motility which is similar to the human phenotype of abnormal sperm motility. Both the model and the patients display male infertility, oligozoospermia, absent sperm flagella, short sperm flagella, coiled sperm flagella and irregularly shaped sperm tails. Lastly, Liu et al. 2018 (PMID: 29843777), shows abnormal heart looping in DNAH10 mutation zebrafish embryos which recapitulates the laterality defects found in the human probands (Figure 3B and 3C).\n\nIn conclusion, DNAH10 has a limited association with Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia. This classification has been clearly demonstrated and confirmed through both experimental and genetic evidence and has been upheld over time. \n\nThis classification was approved by the Motile Ciliopathy GCEP on February 13th, 2025 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fe1e213e-3eda-41fc-8076-14a627925add","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/698c6b23-a6fb-4b56-a38e-b29d5f8bbd86","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/698c6b23-a6fb-4b56-a38e-b29d5f8bbd86_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10102","date":"2025-04-16T14:45:19.263Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/698c6b23-a6fb-4b56-a38e-b29d5f8bbd86_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10102","date":"2025-02-13T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/698c6b23-a6fb-4b56-a38e-b29d5f8bbd86_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9f6360d4-c3de-464c-b214-c39f8d963e9b_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e5c1b6c8-a67f-4a50-a694-312024625631","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Not a PCD proband.","calculatedScore":4,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e5c1b6c8-a67f-4a50-a694-312024625631_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"Functional Evidence:\n\nFigure 2 - Morphology of spermatozoa in a patient carrying a DNAH10 variant.
