The BCOR gene was first reported in relation to X-linked oculofaciocardiodental and Lenz microphthalmia syndromes in 2004 (Ng et al., PMID 15004558). Evidence supporting these gene-disease relationships includes case-level data and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least nine probands in three publications (Hilton et al., 2009 PMID 19367324; Kraus et al., 2018 PMID 30450806; Ragge et al., 2019 PMID 29974297). At least seven unique variants have been reported in humans, including six predicted null variants in female patients and one recurrent missense variant in male patients. De novo occurrence and inheritance from an affected mother have been reported in females, while male patients typically inherit the missense variant from unaffected mothers. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic and experimental evidence (12 pts) has been reached. The mechanism for BCOR-related syndromic microphthalmia is not completely understood; however, loss of function and haploinsufficiency appear to play an important role. This gene-disease association is also supported by expression in relevant tissues during embryogenesis, and data from a non-human model organisms, including zebrafish and Xenopus knockdown models and a conditional knockout mouse model (Ng et al., 2004 PMID 15004558; Wamstad & Bardwell, 2007 PMID 17344103; Hilton et al., 2007 PMID 17517692; Hamline et al., 2020 PMID 32692983). In summary, BCOR is definitively associated with X-linked syndromic microphthalmia. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.\n\nLumping and Splitting: Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no clear difference in the phenotypic variability or molecular mechanism(s) underlying the disease entities: oculofaciocardiodental syndrome (MONDO:0017125) and Lenz-type microphthalmia (MONDO:0018924). There is phenotypic variability seen in both male and female patients, and the body systems affected are similar in males and females and include ocular, cardiac, and skeletal defects, developmental delays and some facial dysmorphisms (Ragge et al., 2019 PMID 29974297). Although null variants cause the disease in females, while missense variants appear to be causative in males, it is suggested that the underlying mechanism is LoF with less severe effect of missense variants and male lethality with null variants (Ng et al., 2004 PMID 15004558; Ragge et al., 2019 PMID 29974297). Male lethality was recently confirmed in a knockout mouse line (Hamline et al., 2020 PMID 32692983).\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ecf3100d-d209-42e2-a50d-b6b6b08bb32c","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3da06b77-1ed0-4197-948c-a9bbf80b6ed4","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3da06b77-1ed0-4197-948c-a9bbf80b6ed4_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10060","date":"2020-12-17T17:13:47.861Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3da06b77-1ed0-4197-948c-a9bbf80b6ed4_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10060","date":"2021-01-08T14:02:34.066Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3da06b77-1ed0-4197-948c-a9bbf80b6ed4_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3da06b77-1ed0-4197-948c-a9bbf80b6ed4_ad_other_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/545296fd-8746-425e-91f4-a12cdd300ea6_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"This is a recurrent missense variant found in at least 7 affected males; relevant publications are: 15004558: Ng et al.

To model OFCD (female phenotype), they generated heterozygous Bcor +/DE9-10 females by breeding females carrying the ubiquitous Cre transgene b-actin-Cre to Bcor Fl/Y males (Fig. 1F, left). This cross generates experimental female Bcor +/DE9-10 (“OFCD animals”). ~50% of female OFCD mice die between birth and weaning, likely due to cleft palate and/or cardiac defects. \n\"OFCD\" female mice: Eye phenotype - Fifty-five percent (23/42) of OFCD animals had lens opacification, and in these animals 8/23 were affected bilaterally while none of the 28 control animals had lens opacification (Fig. 2A). On average the width of all OFCD globes was 0.2 mm less than that of controls (Fig. 2B). In addition, there was pronounced bilateral asymmetry of the globe width in the OFCD animals (Fig. 2C). Facial features - OFCD mice snouts were occasionally broader or asymmetric (Fig. 1I, middle and Fig. 2 E, F). Bcor is expressed in the eyelid progenitor cells and often the eyelids of OFCD animals appeared ptotic and/or swollen and more prone to closure, which, together with the microphthalmia, was the most common recognizable facial feature (Fig. 2 E, F). Skeletal abnormalies - OFCD mice often developed kyphosis (Fig. 2G) and occasionally manifested dental abnormalities. \nMale lethality: In crossing Bcor f/f female mice with male Cre mice, the Bcor het male mice were lethal by ~E9. The forebrain was reduced in size and, consistent with this reduction, Otx2, Fgf8 and Foxg1 expression was reduced (Fig. 3). In somite-matched embryos, the trunk region was reduced in size, suggesting that heart development is affected.\nOther cell type specific Cre alleles: Mutation of Bcor in neural crest cells (Pax3-Cre) caused cleft palate, shortening of the mandible and tympanic bone, ectopic salivary glands and abnormal tongue musculature (Fig. 4). Defects in the mandibular region (Wnt1-Cre), rather than in the palate itself, led to palatal clefting and ectopic salivary gland formation (Fig. 5). Mutation of Bcor in hindlimb progenitor cells of the lateral mesoderm (Isl1-Cre) resulted in 2/3 syndactyly (Fig. 6). Mutation of Bcor in Isl1-expressing lineages that contribute to the heart caused defects including persistent truncus arteriosus, ventricular septal defect and fetal lethality (Fig. 6).","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32692983","rdfs:label":"Knockout mouse model","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/89957e4a-79f2-4d4b-804a-e273abb3198f","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Female and male human patients show ocular defects (including cataracts and microphthalmia), skeletal defects (particularly in the hands and feet), and neurologic abnormalities especially in males (show ID, microcephaly, and/or morphological abnormalities).

Antisense splice-blocking morpholino oligonucleotides were used to target the splice donor junctions of the zebrafish orthologs of human BCOR exons 9 and 10 (MO9, MO10); these exons were selected for their proximity to the human mutations.
