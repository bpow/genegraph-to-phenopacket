At least 4 unique variants (splice-site, nonsense, and missense) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 4 probands in 4 publications (PMID: 22981119, 26226137, 28183797, 31661684). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in at least 12 additional family members. This gene-disease association is supported by animal models, expression studies, and in vitro function studies. In summary, CABP2 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/78ba5f5f-2d42-4a13-ab6e-3910d456fe66","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/20de88d2-6681-4522-9e11-26cdf66a2c15","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/20de88d2-6681-4522-9e11-26cdf66a2c15_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2020-02-06T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/20de88d2-6681-4522-9e11-26cdf66a2c15_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/20de88d2-6681-4522-9e11-26cdf66a2c15_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1e7b1740-3114-4fb2-b377-385e1e3ce767_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c8ace400-65eb-4c7f-a156-5bb59ae48a3d","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26226137","rdfs:label":"Bademci Proband","ageType":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/","ageUnit":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/","detectionMethod":"Found in cohort of 160 families undergoing WES","firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypes":"obo:HP_0000407","previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1e7b1740-3114-4fb2-b377-385e1e3ce767_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26226137","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/efb1f1e3-250d-46f3-8788-e9f69f4a52b7","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NC_000011.10:g.67519941C>A","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA381513655"}}}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9a29dae0-dfe1-4f62-9a67-0215a8a934ba_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ceeb02a1-5328-4096-baab-fdc0f4cb8380","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28183797","rdfs:label":"Picher Proband","ageType":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/","ageUnit":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/","detectionMethod":"Screened TECTA and CABP2 based on audiogram shape","firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"prelingual HL, symmetrical, moderate to severe across all frequencies (U-shaped audiogram, though)","previousTesting":false,"previousTestingDescription":"","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9a29dae0-dfe1-4f62-9a67-0215a8a934ba_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28183797","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3784ff5c-df7c-4ef7-b5af-29365d8435e9","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NC_000011.10:g.67520074C>A","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA381513967"}}}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2df3b8d0-a979-4047-b11d-8df32955fcc1_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Downgraded because variant is present in 93/25704 Finnish (0.35%), 50/30776 South Asian (0.16%), and 135/126368 European (0.11%) alleles in gnomAD, but no homozygotes.
