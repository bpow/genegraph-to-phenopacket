To date, two cases from two publications have reported biallelic inheritance of *DNAJB11* variants in two individuals presenting with an earlier onset, much more severe phenotype than individuals with a monoallelic variant (PMIDs 34177435 and 33129895). This gene-disease association is supported by an expression study. In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship between *DNAJB11* and autosomal recessive ciliopathy. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Kidney Cystic and Ciliopathy Disorders GCEP on the meeting date 4/27/2022 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c5809a18-a517-473f-9899-f2b0685dc830","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/42197b67-3c9d-47e6-b9c2-d6d3ef076acc","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/42197b67-3c9d-47e6-b9c2-d6d3ef076acc_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10066","date":"2022-04-27T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/42197b67-3c9d-47e6-b9c2-d6d3ef076acc_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10066","date":"2023-03-10T15:54:45.412Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/42197b67-3c9d-47e6-b9c2-d6d3ef076acc_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/44f211b4-e570-4fd2-b147-ee78e4b436b6_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ac16d161-abc2-4309-982c-10c65b82c8e6","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Homozygous variants with some functional data","calculatedScore":4,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ac16d161-abc2-4309-982c-10c65b82c8e6_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"Reverse transcription PCR with primers located in exons 4 and 9 of the affected fetus kidneys' RNAs amplified two products.
