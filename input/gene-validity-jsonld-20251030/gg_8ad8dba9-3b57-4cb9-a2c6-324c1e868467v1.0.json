The PDSS2 gene encodes prenyl diphosphate synthase subunit 2, which is important early in the coenzyme Q10 biosynthesis pathway. Coenzyme Q10 is critical for many processes in the cell, including in the mitochondrial respiratory chain transferring electrons from complexes I and II to complex III.\n\nThe PDSS2 gene was first reported in association with autosomal recessive Leigh syndrome spectrum in 2006 (PMID: 17186472). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included two variants identified in one cases from one publications (PMID: 17186472), as well as a case reported in a book chapter (Quinzii C, Loos M. Multisystemic Infantile CoQ10 Deficiency with Renal Involvement. In: Russell P. Saneto, Sumit Parikh and Bruce H. Cohen, editors. Mitochondrial Case Studies Underlying Mechanisms and Diagnosis. Academic Press; 2016. pp 299-04). No segregation data were available. Loss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease association is also supported by known biochemical function, expression, functional alteration in patient cells, functional alteration in non-patient cells, and animal models (PMIDs: 27977873, 21139605, 17186472, 29967258, 18437205, 23150520).\n\nIn summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on July 13, 2020 (SOP Version 7).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8ad8dba9-3b57-4cb9-a2c6-324c1e868467","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5e0928f3-2b7d-4622-bc96-68a4d0078826","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5e0928f3-2b7d-4622-bc96-68a4d0078826_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2021-03-11T17:24:16.347Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5e0928f3-2b7d-4622-bc96-68a4d0078826_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2021-03-11T17:23:36.036Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5e0928f3-2b7d-4622-bc96-68a4d0078826_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bd78ffcc-7982-4f81-a664-f9123880cc98_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Does not meet inclusion criteria.","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fb0d087b-d8b9-4e22-a33c-9e611988f7e2","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10972372","rdfs:label":"Rotig 2000 patient 1","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":11,"detectionMethod":"Genetic testing methodology not known.","phenotypeFreeText":"Diagnosed with coenzyme Q10 deficiency.

Bilateral sensorineural deafness was suspected early (at 3 months) and was further confirmed by detection of impaired auditive evoked potentials at 1 year (50 dB). He could sit at 6 months and walk unaided at 18 months. Nephrotic syndrome was diagnosed at 3 years and resulted in terminal renal failure that required kidney transplantation at 9 years. Progressive ataxia, dystonia with generalised amyotrophy, and increased deep tendon reflexes of lower limbs substantially hindered his ability to walk unaided. At 12 years, he could no longer ride his bicycle or walk unaided and he became progressively wheelchair-bound. He had a long face with large ears, a gaping mouth, and increased salivation, but no specific dysmorphic features were noted. Magnetic resonance imaging showed abnormal signals in the periventricular and cerebellar white matter, with moderate ventricular dilatation (not shown). Hypertrophic normokinetic cardiomyopathy was found at age 11 years. Metabolic investigation showed normal plasma and cerebrospinal fluid lactate.
