There has not been further evidence in the literature associating this gene with a specific phenotype. The proband described in this paper was a child from a consanguineous family who was found to have homozygous mutations in two genes: *SLC33A1* and *CCS*. His phenotype was mostly consistent with Huppke-Brendel syndrome (caused by bi-allelic pathogenic variants in *SLC33A1* with an unclear contribution from the missense variants in *CCS* reported in this paper. Currently, there are no OMIM phenotypes associated with this gene. A gene-disease relationship in the published case report was postulated by\nprotein expression analysis through Western blotting on the proband’s fibroblasts, which showed that\nCCS protein levels were about 40% of those in controls, and that SOD1 enzyme activity was significantly\ndecreased (Huppker et al., PMID: 22508683). This evidence was not scored in the present curation due to an alternative explanation for the described phenotype. In summary, there is limited evidence supporting the relationship between *CCS* and the autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism. This classification was approved by the ClinGen IEM GCEP on the meeting date [September, 27, 2024] (SOP Version 10).\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/da55d97c-2eef-4fc3-abe2-5fbac1398778","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e2f759b8-ef60-4bfd-a56f-f62feb409840","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"NoKnownDiseaseRelationship","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e2f759b8-ef60-4bfd-a56f-f62feb409840_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10097","date":"2024-09-30T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e2f759b8-ef60-4bfd-a56f-f62feb409840_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10097","date":"2024-09-30T19:29:43.953Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e2f759b8-ef60-4bfd-a56f-f62feb409840_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e2f759b8-ef60-4bfd-a56f-f62feb409840_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0}],"evidenceStrength":"NoKnownDiseaseRelationship","sequence":9069,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria11","strengthScore":0,"subject":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fsoXPG7kZQQ","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0017762","gene":"hgnc:1613","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000005"},"version":"1.0","websiteLegacyID":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/assertion_e2f759b8-ef60-4bfd-a56f-f62feb409840-","@context":{"@vocab":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"},"curationReasons":{"@type":"@vocab","@container":"@set"},"GCISnapshot":{"@type":"@id"},"dc:isVersionOf":{"@type":"@id"},"websiteLegacyID":{"@type":"@id"}}}
