DGKE metabolizes 1,2,diacylglycerol (DAG) to produce phosphatidic acid (PA). DAGs modify slit diaphragm function in podocytes, a disturbance of which is consistent with renal-specific effects. It is expressed in the endothelium of glomerular capillaries and podocytes (PMID: 23542698).\n\nMultiple disease entities have been reported in association with this gene. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, there was evidence of differences in their phenotypic spectrum. Therefore, the following disease entities have been split into multiple disease entityies: atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) and membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN). Autosomal recessive aHUS has been curated separately.\n\nDGKE was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis in 2012 (Ozaltin et al., PMID: 23274426). MPGN is characterized by glomerular proliferative/exudative processes which can result in mesangial expansion, hyperlobulated glomeruli, and splitting of the glomerular basement membrane, thereby causing injury of podocytes, glomerular capillaries, and mesangial cells (PMID: 21839367, 23274426). The mechanism of pathogenicity is unknown to be loss of function.\n\nAt least 7 variants (missense, in-frame indel, nonsense, frameshift, canonical splice site) have been reported in 6 probands 4 publications (PMIDs: 23274426, 32386968, 35570599, 37433757 included in this curation). A total of 11.1/12 pts. for genetic evidence was reached considering case-level data.\n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by expression studies and an animal model. DGKE is expressed in glomerular endothelium including the capillaries and podocytes (PMID: 23542698). Additionally, DGKE knockout mouse models demonstrated glomeruli impairment supportive of disease (PMID: 26887830). A total of 1.5/6 pts. for experimental evidence was reached.\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between DGKE and autosomal recessive membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time.\n\nThis classification was approved by the ClinGen Complement-Mediated Kidney Diseases GCEP on the meeting date February 19, 2025 (SOP Version 11).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3d6ace79-1e27-4e93-9d94-e7c3294320e7","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/99d5772a-c32d-4f71-a67c-8820d13e703c","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10068","role":"SecondaryContributor"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/99d5772a-c32d-4f71-a67c-8820d13e703c_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10069","date":"2025-04-03T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/99d5772a-c32d-4f71-a67c-8820d13e703c_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10069","date":"2025-05-15T14:42:56.787Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["ErrorClarification"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/99d5772a-c32d-4f71-a67c-8820d13e703c_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/99d5772a-c32d-4f71-a67c-8820d13e703c_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/629d1126-ccd2-47ec-918e-7aaf626a3483","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/56d0e20f-193b-41b8-baeb-b5da898ac4e5","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Staining of normal human kidney revealed DGKE expression in endothelium of glomerular capillaries and podocytes.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23542698","rdfs:label":"DGKE expression in glomerular capillaries and podocytes","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/99d5772a-c32d-4f71-a67c-8820d13e703c_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/70c835fc-39f9-47f4-bbee-1f3f6405fdbd","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Reduced to 1 point as the model does not perfectly phenocopy human presentations of MPGN.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f5e68efa-7a4d-4dfd-b3c2-9a5cac5c2bb4","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Glomeruli of DGKE KO mice have submicroscopic signs of endothelial impairment that become more pronounced with age.
