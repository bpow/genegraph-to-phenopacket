Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome 10 is a subtype of HPS, characterized by neutropenia, immune defects and neurological manifestations, in addition to oculocutaneous albinism and bleeding tendency. AP3D1 encodes the δ subunit of the adaptor complex-3, AP3, which is a coat protein complex that forms intracellular vesicles (Huizing et al., Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome, GeneReviews). The AP3D1 deficiency phenotype presents a phenotypic spectrum that has overlap with that observed with AP3B1 and AP3B2 deficiencies (PMID: 27889060). Only 2 reports have been published so far, each reporting one homozygous deletion variant (PMIDs: 26744459, 30472485). In addition, a 12kb deletion in the mouse Ap3d gene is reported to be causative of a phenotype in the “mocha” mice, which is similar to HPS10 in humans (PMID: 9697856). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level and experimental data.  \n   \nSummary of Case Level Data: 5.2 POINTS \nVariants in this gene have been reported in at least 2 probands in 2 publications (PMID: 26744459 , 30472485). As well as a third case reminiscent of HPS10, though milder and lacking the characteristic albinism (PMID: 36445457).\n   \nThe mechanism for disease is expected to be homozygous loss of function (PMID: 26744459).\n  \nSummary of Experimental Data: 4.5 POINTS \nThis gene-disease association is supported by studies in a spontaneously occurring mouse mutation, the “mocha” mice (PMID: 9697856) and a zebrafish model of syndromic albinism (PMID: 35816398). As well as an experimental rescue in patient cells (PMID: 26744459). \n  \nIn summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship.\n\nThis gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the HT GCEP on 02/26/2020. It was reevaluated on 04/03/2023. As a result of this reevaluation a new possible case (PMID: 36445457) and a new model organism (PMID: 35816398) were identified and the classification was increased from Limited to Moderate (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e710224c-d551-44b9-922a-8a4d044c6294","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3ec9ffa2-efda-446d-a848-e6d4d5b92fb6","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","changes":[{"id":"cg:newEvidence"},{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"},{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},{"id":"cg:classificationChange"},{"id":"cg:sopChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3ec9ffa2-efda-446d-a848-e6d4d5b92fb6_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2023-06-07T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3ec9ffa2-efda-446d-a848-e6d4d5b92fb6_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2023-06-07T19:48:43.477Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3ec9ffa2-efda-446d-a848-e6d4d5b92fb6_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3ec9ffa2-efda-446d-a848-e6d4d5b92fb6_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/000cbb79-d39f-4e7d-aa0b-6d6961d116af","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e2b46a77-61c1-4a78-a0c3-b62a9df3f75b","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Ap3B1 is shown to form the AP3 adaptor complex with AP3D1 as well as the σ3 and  μ3 subunits","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11807095","rdfs:label":"Peden_Function shared with AP3B1","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionA"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3ec9ffa2-efda-446d-a848-e6d4d5b92fb6_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/80e4ed96-9757-4543-9caa-229eb018bff3","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The evidence is awarded default points for the rescue of the molecular phenotype.","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/231f05f2-360a-4a7d-a0e8-4bbf12b8d5af","type":"Finding","dc:description":"The expression of AP3δ was observed by immunofluorescence in GFP-positive cells only.
