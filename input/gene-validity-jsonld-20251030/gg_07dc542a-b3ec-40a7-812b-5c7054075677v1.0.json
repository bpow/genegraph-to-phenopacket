From GeneReviews, Pathogenic variants in *ALS2* are responsible for a retrograde degeneration of the upper motor neurons of the pyramidal tracts, leading to phenotypes on a clinical continuum ranging from infantile ascending hereditary spastic paraplegia (IAHSP) to juvenile forms without lower motor neuron involvement (juvenile primary lateral sclerosis [JPLS]) or with lower motor neuron involvement (juvenile amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [JALS]), and as such have been lumped into a single disease entity for curation. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Thirteen variants have been curated in relation to motor neuron disease (including frameshift, nonsense, and splice variants as well as some missense), found in 12 probands in 5 publications (PMIDs: 11586298, 16240357, 23282280, 24562058, 33155358). Cosegregation of variants with disease was reported in at least 18 family members as well. Additional evidence is available in the literature but the maximum score for genetic evidence was reached. Experimentally, this gene-disease relationship is supported by its biochemical function; *ALS2* encodes Alsin, which regulates actin-based neurite outgrowth (PMID: 16049005) as a prominent guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for the small GTPase Rab5 (PMID: 12837691). The pathomechanism of *ALS2* mutations is considered to be loss of function, and likely involves unlinking or disturbing the connections between *ALS2* and Rab5, which reduces actin-based intracellular trafficking and glutamate signaling at synapses (Lai et al., 2009). The presence of both Rac1 and Rab5 GEF activities makes Alsin a unique dual exchange factor that may couple endocytosis (via Rab5 activation) to cytoskeletal modulation (via Rac1 activation). Several different lines of *ALS2* knockout (ALS2–/–) mice have been generated by independent groups (PMIDs: 16107644, 16321985, 16769894, 16802286, 16675207, 17855450). The loss of alsin does not have a drastic effect on the survival or function of motor neurons in mice. However, subtle deficits observed in the behavior and pathology of these mice have aided in the understanding of the relationship between alsin and motor neuron dysfunction. In summary, there is definitive evidence to support the gene-disease relationship of autosomal recessive *ALS2* related motor neuron disease. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/07dc542a-b3ec-40a7-812b-5c7054075677","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b31dd10c-0b38-4edf-8e23-fb2652c6e939","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b31dd10c-0b38-4edf-8e23-fb2652c6e939_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10096","date":"2023-02-14T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b31dd10c-0b38-4edf-8e23-fb2652c6e939_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10096","date":"2023-05-26T13:16:40.844Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b31dd10c-0b38-4edf-8e23-fb2652c6e939_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b31dd10c-0b38-4edf-8e23-fb2652c6e939_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/08a917e5-3fb6-4852-9c90-0f1c841ea0d3","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"To study the pathologic mechanisms of ALS2 deficiency, four different lines of ALS2 knockout (ALS2–/–) mice have been generated by independent groups.

Devon observed a similar reduction of locomotor activity for their knockout mice in the open-field test, which lasted for 3 min.\n\nCai and Deng found ALS2–/– mice perform poorly in the rotarod test for motor coordination starting from 12 months of age.  In the same experimental paradigm, Yamanaka found that ALS2–/– mice began to show a motor coordination problem at 5 months of age that worsened at 16 months of age. However, Hadano and Devon did not observe a similar motor coordination deficit in their knockout mice. \n\nCai also found that ALS2–/–mice displayed motor learning deficits at 20 months of age, indicating that alsin, which is most abundant in the cerebellum, may participate in cerebellum-dependent motor learning. Yamanaka ran a similar motor learning test for their mice at 5 and 16 months of age, but did not find any significant alterations in motor learning.\n\nYamanaka also observed a decrease in the running speed of ALS2–/– mice in the running wheel test starting from 5 months of age. \n\nIn summary, motor behavioral studies indicate that ALS2–/– mice display reduced locomotor activity initially in a novel environment due to higher anxiety, exhibit a motor coordination deficit in the rotarod test, and show reduced running speed in the running wheel test. Consistent with the modest motor behavioral deficits observed in ALS2–/– mice, no major neuropathological abnormalities have been found in these animals.\n\nConceivably, the anatomical and potentially physiological discrepancy between the human and mouse upper motor neurons may explain the relatively normal motor phenotype of the aged ALS2–/– mice. The absence of severe motor phenotypes in ALS2–/– mice may also be related to gene redundancy, in which genes with the similar function could compensate for the loss of function of alsin.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18714162","rdfs:label":"ALS2/Alsin Knockout Mice","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":3}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":3},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b31dd10c-0b38-4edf-8e23-fb2652c6e939_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cf967e4e-ad9f-48d5-b514-d1fce47d3af8","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Showed that the ALS2 protein specifically binds to small GTPase Rab5 and functions as a GEF for Rab5.
