One missense variant has been reported in a family with left ventricular noncompaction and ventricular septal defect. Of note, this gene has also been implicated in dilated cardiomyopathy and was separately curated for that gene-disease relationship. Evidence disputing this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data. The one missense variant reported is too frequent to cause disease. There are additional probands with deletions including *DTNA* that also include other genes (26893613, 24036431, 31390163). Therefore, none of the published genetic evidence was scorable. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes protein interaction data only (26744331). In summary, due to the lack of convincing genetic evidence, the evidence supporting the relationship between* DTNA* and autosomal dominant congenital heart disease has been disputed and no valid evidence remains to support the claim. More evidence is needed to either support or entirely refute the role *DTNA* plays in this disease. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Congenital Heart Disease GCEP on the meeting date February 6th, 2024 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/93c58f39-e764-46be-93e3-6fcb9ecd49d2","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/dd37e3a0-bb02-4450-86c5-46e9c64d1d39","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"NoKnownDiseaseRelationship","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/dd37e3a0-bb02-4450-86c5-46e9c64d1d39_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10130","date":"2024-04-02T20:44:31.055Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/dd37e3a0-bb02-4450-86c5-46e9c64d1d39_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10130","date":"2024-02-06T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"DTNA
