{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3d43609a-7950-4647-8d5b-ea15466f752bv1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"The relationship between *NDUFS8* and primary mitochondrial disease was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of November 6, 2023. The *NDUFS8* gene encodes the NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) core subunit S8. Defects of this protein lead to complex I deficiency.\n\n*NDUFS8* was first reported in relation to primary mitochondrial disease in 1998 (PMID: 9837812). While various names have been given to the constellation of features seen in those with *NDUFS8*-related disease, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *NDUFS8* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework. Of note, *NDUFS8* was previously curated by this GCEP on November 20, 2019 (SOP Version 7) as having a moderate association with autosomal recessive Leigh syndrome spectrum (LSS). The scope of this current curation encompassed cases of primary mitochondrial disease, which includes cases with LSS. \n\nEvidence supporting the relationship between *NDUFS8* and autosomal recessive primary mitochondrial disease includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation includes 10 variants identified in 10 unrelated probands from eight publications (PMIDs: 9837812, 15159508, 20818383, 22499348, 23430795, 19336460, 20819849, 36101822). All reported variants were missense. Affected individuals present with complex I deficiency and variable other features with a typically progressive disease course. Age of onset is typically in infancy or childhood. Clinical features may include LSS, lactic acidosis, developmental delay and regression, dystonia, seizures, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, respiratory insufficiency, episodic apnea, progressive external ophthalmoplegia, and poor feeding. \n\nThe mechanism of disease is loss of function. This gene-disease association is also supported by a biochemical function in mitochondrial complex I shared by more than 10 other genes also associated with primary mitochondrial disease as well as model systems (PMIDs: 33340416, 29285794, 19672299).\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between *NDUFS8* and primary mitochondrial disease. This relationship has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on November 6, 2023 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3d43609a-7950-4647-8d5b-ea15466f752b","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f6764a20-2ddc-4ede-9173-409b0ae18c18","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f6764a20-2ddc-4ede-9173-409b0ae18c18_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2023-11-06T05:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f6764a20-2ddc-4ede-9173-409b0ae18c18_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2024-05-30T15:47:23.622Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f6764a20-2ddc-4ede-9173-409b0ae18c18_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fbf8bbf2-6454-42a2-b44e-8ec414c8d304_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/01690bc6-6e8b-4d7b-b293-caf39fd477b8","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Levels of NDUFS8 were reduced within both patient derived lymphoblasts and muscle mitochondria; as were the levels of the 39, 49, and 51 kDa proteins of complex I.","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/01690bc6-6e8b-4d7b-b293-caf39fd477b8_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"Levels of NDUFS8 were reduced within both patient derived lymphoblasts and muscle mitochondria; as were the levels of the 39, 49, and 51 kDa proteins of complex I.","functionalDataSupport":"Yes"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/01690bc6-6e8b-4d7b-b293-caf39fd477b8_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15159508","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8904d18c-9e71-4457-85bb-2db104a876db","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_002496.4(NDUFS8):c.413G>A (p.Arg138His)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA118857"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6d11de5f-6a6e-4cd4-93ce-2423e4001f83","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Levels of NDUFS8 were reduced within both patient derived lymphoblasts and muscle mitochondria; as were the levels of the 39, 49, and 51 kDa proteins of complex I.","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6d11de5f-6a6e-4cd4-93ce-2423e4001f83_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"Levels of NDUFS8 were reduced within both patient derived lymphoblasts and muscle mitochondria; as were the levels of the 39, 49, and 51 kDa proteins of complex I.","functionalDataSupport":"Yes"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6d11de5f-6a6e-4cd4-93ce-2423e4001f83_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15159508","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fb12e1a8-f416-4c53-8d6c-528b0ad16fae","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_002496.4(NDUFS8):c.254C>T (p.Pro85Leu)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA118855"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fbf8bbf2-6454-42a2-b44e-8ec414c8d304","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15159508","rdfs:label":"Procaccio_Case","allele":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fb12e1a8-f416-4c53-8d6c-528b0ad16fae"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8904d18c-9e71-4457-85bb-2db104a876db"}],"phenotypeFreeText":"This girl had a diagnosis of late onset Leigh syndrome​.

The KM was significantly reduced in the NUIM p.Pro98Leu variant only.","functionalDataSupport":"Yes"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/dcae455e-1eea-4c37-9b15-d9b3b75af02e_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9837812","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e4e8a92e-539d-4c37-8f70-21c479389bce","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_002496.4(NDUFS8):c.305G>A (p.Arg102His)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA118854"}},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4e6668e5-46e7-468e-9302-a65324dd56fa","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9837812","rdfs:label":"Loeffen_Proband 1","allele":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e4e8a92e-539d-4c37-8f70-21c479389bce"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/373e1d0f-36ae-4d52-adc9-13afec5c521e"}],"phenotypeFreeText":"This individual had a neuropathological diagnosis of Leigh syndrome.
