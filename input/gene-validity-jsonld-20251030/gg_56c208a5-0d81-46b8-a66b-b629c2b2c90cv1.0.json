One missense variant reported in one proband that also segregated with disease in two additional family members was included in this curation (PMID: 23493554). The affected family members presented with increased risk of respiratory infections and immune features, including hypogammaglobulinemia and abnormal B- and T-cell populations. The mechanism of pathogenicity is unknown. This gene-disease association is also supported by a mouse model and in vitro studies in cell lines (PMIDs: 9405449, 9560343, 12411489, 16325585, 23493554). TNFSF12 is expressed in a wide range of tissues and cells, including human spleen, lymph nodes, and immune cells (PMID: 9405449, 12411489), and it can be found as both a transmembrane protein and secreted cytokine (PMID: 29038621). Upregulation of TNFSF12 and its receptor FN14 (i.e., TWEAKR) has been found to occur in response to inflammation (PMID: 24636536). In addition, the TNFSF12/FN14 pathway has multiple functions, such as in regulation of skeletal muscle cell progenitor proliferation and differentiation (PMID: 17124496) and cutaneous inflammation, including as a critical contributor to the chronic inflammatory skin condition psoriasis (PMID: 30038329). Furthermore, TNFSF12 regulates NFkB activity, apoptosis, and proliferation in immune cells (PMID: 9405449, 9560343, 12411489). The presence of a patient-derived TNFSF12 variant  resulted in decreased apoptosis of and NFkB activity in cell lines compared ot WT TNFSF12, while exposure of B cells to the mutant TNFSF12 protein with BAFF resulted in decreased B-cell proliferation compared to WT TNFSF12 (PMID: 23493554). A TNFSF12-/- mouse model displayed T-cell defects, but other features of TNFSF12-associated disease were not assessed (PMID: 16325585). In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/56c208a5-0d81-46b8-a66b-b629c2b2c90c","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b943345a-024d-401d-a147-470c0ea0381c","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b943345a-024d-401d-a147-470c0ea0381c_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10080","date":"2022-07-22T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b943345a-024d-401d-a147-470c0ea0381c_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10080","date":"2022-08-23T21:19:37.349Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b943345a-024d-401d-a147-470c0ea0381c_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b5ba6cba-bb4d-495b-b26c-3a76f61b0c71","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"This synonymous variant was reported in a patient with CVID with no additional variants reported in 20 genes screened in panel.
