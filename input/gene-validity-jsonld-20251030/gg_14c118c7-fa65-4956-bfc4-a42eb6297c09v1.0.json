In this study, a homozygous missense variant in *FAAP24* was identified in two siblings from a consanguineous family with a fatal Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-related lymphoproliferative disease. The allele frequency in the general population for the variant in these cases is higher than would be expected for disease-causing variants in this gene and was flagged as contradictory evidence. Given the allele frequency of the variant (particularly the presence of multiple homozygotes past the age of onset in the general population) in the only two patients with this disorder reported to date, there is convincing evidence disputing the relationship between *FAAP24* and autosomal recessive lymphoproliferative syndrome. \n\nThis gene-disease association may be supported by in vitro functional assays. Experimental evidence assessing *FAAP24* expression and biochemical function supported this gene’s role in DNA damage repair pathways (PMID: 27473539, 23999858, 23333308). However, it is currently unclear if this role is consistent with the mechanism of disease and the data was insufficient for scoring. \n\nIn summary, the evidence supporting the relationship between *FAAP24* and autosomal recessive lymphoproliferative syndrome has been disputed and no valid evidence remains to support the claim. More evidence is needed to either support or entirely refute the role *FAAP24* plays in this disease.\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/14c118c7-fa65-4956-bfc4-a42eb6297c09","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/640890b8-ed2f-46bd-bf07-74e59da80cc2","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"NoKnownDiseaseRelationship","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/640890b8-ed2f-46bd-bf07-74e59da80cc2_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10145","date":"2024-06-07T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/640890b8-ed2f-46bd-bf07-74e59da80cc2_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10145","date":"2024-06-07T21:19:08.637Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"Only two patients from the same consanguineous family have been published with a FAAP24 variant associated with this disorder.

However, the available data does not support the pathogenicity of this variant. Most importantly, frequency in general populations appears too high for this variant to be causing severe childhood onset disease. \nMultiple homozygotes have been reported for this variant in individuals past the age of disease onset for the family described here (note there may be overlap in the homozygotes indicated for the datasets (gnomAD v2: 02340; 1 homozygote->45 yrs old; gnomAD v4: 13 homozygotes (8 exome, 5 genome)-at least 5 are >50 yrs old; Almena: 2 homozygotes). Furthermore, this family is consanguineous, making the presence of this homozygous variant less impactful.  When assessing the pathogenicity of the variant, in silico predictors yield inconclusive results (REVEL: 0.328 which is below the ClinGen suggested threshold of 0.75 to support pathogenicity) and there is no splicing effect predicted. While functional studies performed in this publication indicate this variant could potentially have an effect in patient cells, based on the information provided it is not clear that the experiments are robust, there is no clear link between the phenotypes observed and the disease occurring in the patients described, nor is it clear that the levels of the defects observed have a clinically significant effect.","calculatedScore":0.2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0b93c61b-7438-4604-8d0d-b731ee97ae50_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"Functional studies were performed utilizing patient cells, however the data does not appear strong (with it being unclear if some of the experiments were well controlled) and the link between the potential functional effects observed here and the patient phenotype is unclear.\n\nFig. 1 b+c: transformed patient cells are suggested to have less FANCD2 ubiquitination than healthy controls; however, only one healthy control was used and the result does not appear significantly different.\nFig 1d: Patient cells displayed decreased phosphorylation of Chk2 and p53 after treatment with DNA damaging agents.
