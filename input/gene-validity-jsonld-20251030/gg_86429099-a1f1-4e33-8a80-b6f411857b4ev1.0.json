Doyne honeycomb retinal dystrophy is characterized by drusen deposits at the level of the Bruck membrane in the macular and around the edge of the optic nerve head. Malattia Leventinese is characterized by small discrete drusen radiate into the peripheral retina, with the later development of confluent soft drusen in the macular. Only one missense pathogenic variant (p.Arg345Trp) is included in this curation, and it has been consistently described in many studies (PMID: 17666404, 11384588, 11389162, 30541486, 22031286, 12242346, 10369267, 17664227). This variant was found to segregate in two families (LOD: 3.91 in PMID: 17666404; LOD=1.2 in PMID: 11384588). Functional studies showed that wildtype EFEMP1 is a secreted protein, whereas mutant EFEMPT1 is misfolded, secreted inefficiently, and retained within cells (PMID: 12242346). In-vivo studies demonstrated that EFEMP1-knockin mice deposit material that resembled basal deposits in patients with macular dystrophy (PMID: 17666404, 17664227). In summary, EFEMP1 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant . This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time.
