Regressive Spondylometaphyseal Dysplasia, AKA Rhizomelic skeletal dysplasia with or without Pelger-Huet anomaly, is a rare, primary bone dysplasia characterized by mild short stature, rhizomelic shortening of the arms and legs, bowing of long bones with widened and irregular metaphyses, thoracolumbar kyphosis, and metacarpal shortening. A marked improvement of the radiologic skeletal features is typical. Variants in LBR have been reported in individuals with the following disease entities: Reynold’s syndrome, Greenberg Skeletal Dysplasia, Pelger-Huet anomaly, and Regressive Spondylometaphyseal Dysplasia. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found a difference in molecular mechanism and phenotypic variability. Therefore, the following disease entities have been split into four disease entities, Reynold’s syndrome (OMIM:613471), Greenberg Skeletal Dysplasia (OMIM:215140), Pelger-Huet anomaly (OMIM:169400), and Regressive Spondylometaphyseal Dysplasia (OMIM:618019). The split curation for AR Greenberg Skeletal Dysplasia will be curated separately by the Skeletal Disorders GCEP.  Eight missense variants and three nonsense variants that have been reported in eight probands in six publications (PMIDs: 23824842, 25348816, 29068549, 30448303, 34467646, 36400164) are included in this curation. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss of function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by a mouse model (PMID: 12490533). In summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Skeletal Disorders GCEP on the meeting date August 7th, 2023 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b847dc91-282b-4d1c-8241-827426c9038e","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9363af5e-5076-4f7b-bff3-3c15751bca92","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9363af5e-5076-4f7b-bff3-3c15751bca92_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10065","date":"2024-01-22T17:55:44.652Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9363af5e-5076-4f7b-bff3-3c15751bca92_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10065","date":"2023-08-07T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9363af5e-5076-4f7b-bff3-3c15751bca92_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9363af5e-5076-4f7b-bff3-3c15751bca92_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5d81f707-af65-4d47-9470-6d91fb2e765d","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The score was downgraded since some skeletal phenotypes were noted but it is not exact to the human phenotype.
