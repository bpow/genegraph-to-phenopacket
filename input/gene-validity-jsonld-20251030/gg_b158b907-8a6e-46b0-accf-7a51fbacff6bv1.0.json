Five unique missense variants in the PDGFRA gene have been observed in individuals with gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), inflammatory fibroid polyps (IFPs), fibrous tumors (FTs), large hands and coarse faces and skin.  Variants segregated with disease in 4 families,  suggesting heterozygous gain of function is the mechanism of tumorigenesis for this gene. This gene-disease relationship is further supported by a knock in mouse model and functional expression studies. In summary, PDGFRA is definitively associated with AD gastrointestinal stromal tumor. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b158b907-8a6e-46b0-accf-7a51fbacff6b","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/08bbf13f-bc04-47a7-a3c5-1ec6abfc9190","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/08bbf13f-bc04-47a7-a3c5-1ec6abfc9190_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10023","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/08bbf13f-bc04-47a7-a3c5-1ec6abfc9190_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10023","date":"2020-01-13T19:55:09.878Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/08bbf13f-bc04-47a7-a3c5-1ec6abfc9190_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/08bbf13f-bc04-47a7-a3c5-1ec6abfc9190_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e4277c8f-bf22-4f7f-b6f4-062838ded703","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Both PDGFRA mutant mouse lines showed similar phenotype of human patients with PDGFRA mutations and GISTs.
