Variant aggregation analysis revealed a significant burden (p=0.0000172) of likely gene damaging *PDGFD* variants in the IPAH cohort as compared to a group of 18,819 European controls (PMID:33971972). Gelinas et al. also reported a missense *PDGFD* variant in a proband with IPAH (PMID:33187088). There is currently no functional evidence demonstrating a damaging effect of any of the reported *PDGFD* variants in humans.\n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by GTEx data, which shows expression in human lung tissue. Gladh et al. (PMID:27032083) reported a transgenic mouse model with a phenotype of increased blood pressure but PH-specific phenotypes were not assessed. Thus, the model received a score of zero in terms of evidence for a PAH relationship. \n\nIn summary, *PDGFD* has a limited association with autosomal dominant PAH. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Pulmonary Hypertension GCEP on the meeting date 08/30/2022 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a90a44ca-50c9-4e75-8821-098d9a7dc9eb","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a5da6fc7-e3a0-4de1-b69d-b86f312b48a1","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a5da6fc7-e3a0-4de1-b69d-b86f312b48a1_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10071","date":"2022-11-03T15:49:54.406Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a5da6fc7-e3a0-4de1-b69d-b86f312b48a1_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10071","date":"2022-11-03T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a5da6fc7-e3a0-4de1-b69d-b86f312b48a1_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a5da6fc7-e3a0-4de1-b69d-b86f312b48a1_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/596fcd4a-0bb3-4588-b6a6-c6eca47a259f","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/726ecf42-3917-446f-9e71-12bbaaf3d557","type":"Finding","dc:description":"GTEx revealed expression in the lung, which is consistent with disease phenotype.
