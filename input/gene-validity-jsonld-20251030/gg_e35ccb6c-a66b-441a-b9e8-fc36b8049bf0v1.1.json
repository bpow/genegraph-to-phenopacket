The *NDUFA11* gene encodes a subunit of complex I of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. \n\nThe *NDUFA11* gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive primary mitochondrial disease in 2008 (PMID: 18306244). While various names have been given to the constellation of features seen in those with *NDUFA11*-related disease, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *NDUFA11* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included one splice region variant that was reported in a homozygous state in three consanguineous Israeli Bedouin families from one publication (PMID: 18306244). RT-PCR from cDNA from patients’ fibroblasts demonstrated a shorter transcript as well as the wild-type transcript, and enzymatic studies from isolated muscle mitochondria showed reduced complex I activity in the three probands (PMID: 18306244). Affected individuals from two families had a fatal infantile lactic acidosis while individuals in the third family had developmental delay, microcephaly, optic atrophy, and seizures. No segregation data were available. This gene-disease association is also supported by known functional alterations in non-patient cells and a Caenorhabditis elegans model organism (PMIDs: 24191001, 27626371, 30531981, 34106255). \n\nIn summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on February 17, 2022 (SOP Version 8).\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e35ccb6c-a66b-441a-b9e8-fc36b8049bf0","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/210108ec-da38-4a32-80b6-8d88f4d22677","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","changes":{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/210108ec-da38-4a32-80b6-8d88f4d22677_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2022-10-11T21:45:20.292Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/210108ec-da38-4a32-80b6-8d88f4d22677_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2022-02-17T05:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/210108ec-da38-4a32-80b6-8d88f4d22677_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/210108ec-da38-4a32-80b6-8d88f4d22677_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c06f281f-901e-4f50-8039-8288c5f34d64","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Knockdown of NDUFA11 suggests NDUFA11 is important for assembly/structural integrity of complex I, and is important for the respirasome formation with complexes III and IV.","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c1561426-b49d-4570-a751-18a8ae8731c8","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Used siRNA knockdown in H9c2 cells (cardioblast cell line) of the complex I subunit NDUFA11.

Reducing (but not eliminating) expression using RNAi allowed development to adulthood. nduf-11 knockdown reduced NDUF-11 was downregulated to ~20% of wild-type levels and complex I levels were reduced to ~50% (Fig. S2). They confirmed nduf-11 is associated with complex I in C.elegans with BN-PAGE, and knockdown of nduf-11 results in destabilization of complex I and its supercomplexes (Fig. 4C) and a dysregulation of respiratory function, including downregulation of fatty acid biosynthesis and upregulation of fatty acid catabolic pathways (Fig. 3). A targeted GFP reporter was used to observe changes in mitochondrial morphology; nduf-11 knockdown mitochondria appeared fragmented and less reticulated (Fig. 5) and cryoelectron\ntomography highlighted aberrant morphology of cristae and widening of both cristae junctions and the intermembrane space (Fig. 6). The respiratory performance of isolated mitochondria was assessed based on their oxygen consumption and membrane potential. When stimulated by the addition of ADP, the rate of respiration increased to drive OXPHOS. This activation dropped from 6.9-fold to a modest 2.3-fold in mitochondria with reduced levels of NDUF-11 (Fig. 7). They next measured the individual enzymatic activities of complex I and II in isolated mitochondrial fractions from N2 control and nduf-11(RNAi)-treated animals (Fig. 8).

Abnormal brain MRI features included signal abnormalities in white matter, gray matter, or both, hypogenesis of the brain, focal encephalomalacia, edema, delayed myelination or hemorrhage\n","previousTesting":false,"sex":"Female","variant":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8585a1c0-58bb-40a1-a130-a76f569e24d4_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32712949","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c0ab28da-9867-4506-a918-f130960ed43b"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"}},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1dc65041-27f4-46fd-8e75-82003e66cbad_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32712949","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6f52704c-541c-4f5b-a436-bb087e901708"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"}}]},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8585a1c0-58bb-40a1-a130-a76f569e24d4","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"not clear if parents tested and if variants are in trans.

Repeated examinations demonstrated acquired microcephaly, marked generalized hypotonia, muscle weakness, and paucity of voluntary movements. Hearing was normal, but visual fixation was impaired with nystagmus in one patient and bilateral optic atrophy in another. Convulsive disorder appeared at 4 months in one patient. Echocardiogram at birth was normal, but hypertrophy of the myocardial walls and septum (wall thickness, 6mm; normal for age, 2.5–3mm) with mild dilatation of the left ventricle was present at 3 to 4 months of age. Plasma lactate level was increased (3.2–10mM), and the patients suffered from exacerbation of the acidosis during intercurrent\ninfections. The electroencephalogram was normal, and brain computed tomography scan performed in two patients demonstrated generalized brain atrophy. Two patients died at\n18 months and 4 years of age during an intercurrent infection. One patient was alive at 6 months at the time of writing this report. \nEnzymatic activities of the five respiratory chain complexes were determined in isolated muscle mitochondria from Patient C-IV-1. The activity of complex I in muscle mitochondria, determined as rotenone-sensitive NADH: cytochrome c oxidoreductase, NADH:ubiquinone reductase, and NADH:ferricyanide reductase, was reduced to 19 to 39% of the control\nmean. The activities of the other complexes were within the reference range.","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4a802b94-9734-4269-aa8e-076b974d18d2_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18306244","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/22d3d301-55c2-4a60-8fcb-96603e7baf3f"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"}}},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4a802b94-9734-4269-aa8e-076b974d18d2","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Score as founder variant (identical haplotype found in all patients); used score from first family (Family A) -0.5 pts per variant = 0.5 pt/variant","calculatedScore":1.0,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4a802b94-9734-4269-aa8e-076b974d18d2_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4a802b94-9734-4269-aa8e-076b974d18d2_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"RT-PCR from cDNA from patients’ fibroblasts detected a shorter transcript that lacked the 3’ end 78 bp of exon 1, as well as the wild-type transcript, suggesting a “leaky” splice variant","functionalDataSupport":"Yes"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":1.0}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria","strengthScore":1.0}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4}],"evidenceStrength":"Limited","sequence":5227,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria8","strengthScore":6,"subject":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/YNBGY7eKUqo","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0044970","gene":"hgnc:20371","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.1","websiteLegacyID":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/assertion_210108ec-da38-4a32-80b6-8d88f4d22677-","@context":{"@vocab":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"},"curationReasons":{"@type":"@vocab","@container":"@set"},"GCISnapshot":{"@type":"@id"},"dc:isVersionOf":{"@type":"@id"},"websiteLegacyID":{"@type":"@id"}}}
