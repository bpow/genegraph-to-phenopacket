Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, AD Wolfram-like syndrome and AD Neonatal diabetes, congenital cataracts and sensorineural hearing loss were lumped together as there are no differences in molecular mechanism, inheritance pattern and phenotypic variability. AR Wolfram syndrome was split due to differences in inheritance pattern and molecular mechanism while AD nonsyndromic hearing loss was split due to differences in phenotypic variability. These split curations have been assessed separately by this expert panel. Biallelic *WFS1* variants in Wolfram syndrome patients are spread over the entire coding region and are typically inactivating, while non-inactivating heterozygous variants that are mainly located in and around the C-terminal protein domain have been found in families with Wolfram-like syndrome. At least eleven unique variants (10 missense, 1 inframe deletion) in this gene have been reported in 21 probands in 14 publications (PMIDs: 18544103, 20069065, 21538838, 27395765, 27217304, 28468959, 36330437, 34643356, 33075784, 33179441, 32700054, 37217489, 38296324, doi:10.1007/s13410-018-0674-6). The de novo variants were implicated with a more severe phenotype. Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 5 additional family members (PMID: 21538838). This gene-disease relationship is also supported by expression and functional alteration evidence (PMID: 27341211, 28468959). In summary, *WFS1* is definitively associated with autosomal dominant Wolfram-like syndrome. This gene-disease relationship was originally evaluated by the ClinGen Hearing Loss GCEP on 4/17/2018 as per SOP v6. It was reevaluated on 6/25/2024 using SOP v10. As a result of this reevaluation, this record underwent a lumping and splitting update and new case level and experimental evidence has been added, but the classification did not change (PMIDs: 28468959, 36330437, 34643356, 33075784, 33179441, 32700054, 32531870, 37217489, 38296324, doi:10.1007/s13410-018-0674-6).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/da70b078-ccac-497a-8e42-45c6f6da6fde","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/17637c9d-03fb-496a-a00c-ae2431f441e8","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","changes":[{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},{"id":"cg:sopChange"},{"id":"cg:newEvidence"},{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/17637c9d-03fb-496a-a00c-ae2431f441e8_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2025-05-22T16:47:14.728Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/17637c9d-03fb-496a-a00c-ae2431f441e8_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10007","date":"2024-06-25T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasonDescription":"This gene-disease association is associated mostly with missense variants.
