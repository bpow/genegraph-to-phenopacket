Evidence of the association of this gene with DCM was re-evaluated using SOP v10 on 3/6/2025. As a result, the classification did not change. A summary of the information contributing to the classification of this gene at the time of re-evaluation is summarized herein.\n\nMYH6 was evaluated for autosomal dominant dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). The MYH6 gene encodes the alpha heavy chain subunit of cardiac myosin (alpha-MHC), a fast ATPase primarily expressed in human atrial tissue.  In addition to DCM, MYH6 has also been reported with congenital heart defects at the time of review. MYH6 has also been curated by the Congenital Heart Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel for MYH6-related congenital heart defects (definitive, May 2023) and by the Hereditary Cardiovascular Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (disputed, July, 2023). This was considered in accordance with ClinGen lumping and splitting criteria. Due to the distinct differences in phenotype for congenital heart disease versus DCM and due to disputed classification for HCM which also carries distinct phenotypic differences, the curation was split and curated for autosomal dominant DCM.\n\nHuman genetic evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data. At time of this curation, there have been more than 60 unique variants (including majority missense (60/65), (2/65) nonsense, frameshift (1/65) and splice variants (2/65)) reported in humans with DCM across 11 primary publications. Given MYH6 has a high background of rare variation (approximate variation rate of 2%) with majority of reported variation being missense, additional supporting evidence was considered for case-level evidence for DCM including functional data, segregation data, or presence of additional, unrelated DCM cases harboring the same MYH6 variant. Functional evidence was reported in one primary publication. In brief, two MYH6 variants were functionally analyzed using adenovirus infected rat ventricular cardiomyocytes; however, evidence was not aberrant for the NM_002471.3(MYH6): c.2489C>T p.(Pro830Leu) variant and the other variant analyzed, NM_002471.3(MYH6): c.3010G>T p.Ala1004Ser, was not considered causative for DCM as due to high frequency in gnomAD (1769x in 1614160 reference alleles in version 4) and therefore were not scored for case-level evidence. At time of this curation, 6 of the primary publications had human genetic evidence for case level data for DCM detailing 6 unique missense variants with additional supporting evidence (PMID: 15998695, 20215591, 25163546, 28416588, 31983221, 34011823) and 3 unique, rare, predicted loss of function variants (PMID: 31983221, 34011823). For the missense variants observed in these cases, all supporting evidence was the presence of additional, unrelated DCM cases harboring a respective variant. Functional evidence was not available in scorable variants that supported pathogenicity.  \n\nAdditional experimental evidence supports this gene-disease association, including expression studies and animal models. Expression evidence in DCM literature is available across 3 primary publications. In brief, Lowes et al. 1997 detailed non-failing human ventricular myocardium expresses substantial amounts of alpha-myosin heavy chain mRNA (alpha-MHC, 23–34% of total) and in heart failure alpha-MHC is downregulated (by 67–84%) and beta-MHC gene expression is upregulated (PMID: 9410910). Similarly, Miyata et al. 2000, detailed alpha-MyHC protein was easily detectable in 12 nonfailing left ventricles. Alpha-MyHC protein represented only 7.3% of total MyHC protein (compared with ~35% of the MyHC mRNA), suggesting that translational regulation may be operative; in contrast, there was effectively no detectable alpha-MyHC protein in the left ventricles of 10 end-stage failing human hearts (PMID 10700442). Most recently Schiano et al. investigated transcriptomic profiles of 11 patients undergoing heart transplantation for familial DCM were compared versus controls utilizing a computational approach with quantitative real-time PCR validation. These results indicated downregulation of MYH6 in DCM-hearts compared to controls (PMID: 34946895). Animal model data was available from 1 primary publication. In brief, Carroll et al., 2016 investigated knockdown of Myh6 in postnatal mouse heart using Myh6 (promotor)-Cas9 mice intraperitoneally injected with AAV9 (adenovirus) encoded single guided RNA against Myh6 at postnatal day 10 quickly and efficiently induces massive cardiac dilation and heart failure, within 3 weeks of AAV delivery of sgRNA (Carroll et al, 2016, 26719419). However, limitations of this interpretation of this evidence are present as the major isoform in the adult mouse ventricle is alpha-Mhc, whereas in the human the major isoform is beta-MHC. \n\nIn summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. More evidence is needed to support the relationship of MYH6 with autosomal dominant DCM. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Dilated Cardiomyopathy Working Group on 3/6/2025 (SOP Version 10).\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/85635ddf-b3ec-4149-82f0-6733639367f9","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6d55ac7b-e9d8-4a97-bb20-92beeffaed96","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","changes":[{"id":"cg:newEvidence"},{"id":"cg:sopChange"},{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6d55ac7b-e9d8-4a97-bb20-92beeffaed96_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10035","date":"2025-09-12T18:08:28.875Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6d55ac7b-e9d8-4a97-bb20-92beeffaed96_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10035","date":"2025-03-07T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["RecurationTiming"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6d55ac7b-e9d8-4a97-bb20-92beeffaed96_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6d55ac7b-e9d8-4a97-bb20-92beeffaed96_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/255d5bb2-87b1-4865-901c-e04765674729","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fd55e819-adb9-4d4a-bb23-7b87ba1fb3e3","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Transcriptomic profiles via NGS from myocardial tissue from patients (cases and controls) undergoing heart transplants were compared using an “original computational approach” via machine learning and was validated via quantitative real-time PCR.\n- DCM cases were defined as familial DCM cases (n= 11, table 2) and controls (n = 11) were defined at those who underwent HTx for non-cardiac issues (not otherwise specified beyond calling them “non-failing hearts”)\n- Data on MYH6 was identified via machine learning analysis.
