{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/33eba624-9e47-4fb6-a0de-340f4319afe4v1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"The relationship between *TTC19* and primary mitochondrial disease was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of August 22, 2024. *TTC19* encodes tetratricopeptide repeat domain-containing protein 19, an assembly factor critical for assembly of complex III of the mitochondrial respiratory chain.\n\n*TTC19* was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive primary mitochondrial disease in 2011 (PMID: 21278747).  While various names have been given to the constellation of features seen in those with *TTC19*-related disorders, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *TTC19* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework. Of note, *TTC19* was first curated by this Expert Panel for its association with Leigh syndrome spectrum (LSS) on August 21, 2019 (SOP V6), with a final classification of Definitive. This current curation for the association with primary mitochondrial disease includes the cases included in the LSS curation.\n\nEvidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included three nonsense variants and two frameshift variants in six probands from four publications (PMIDs: 21278747, 24397319, 25652355, 37927170). There are additional cases reported in the medical literature; however, these were not included in this curation as the maximum genetic evidence score was reached. Age of onset varies from early in life to adulthood. Clinical features in affected individuals include LSS, global developmental delay, developmental regression, ataxia, dysarthria, seizures, neuropathy, myopathy, psychiatric involvement, hearing loss, and lactic acidosis. Complex III deficiency is seen in biopsied skeletal muscle.  \n\nThe mechanism of disease is loss of function. This gene-disease association is also supported by the known biochemical function of TTC19 in complex III assembly, functional alteration in patient cells, a mouse model, and a fruit fly model (PMIDs: 21278747, 28673544).\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between *TTC19* and primary mitochondrial disease. This relationship has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on August 22, 2024 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/33eba624-9e47-4fb6-a0de-340f4319afe4","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cbdcc236-0167-4739-a925-0812b5cca283","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cbdcc236-0167-4739-a925-0812b5cca283_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2025-01-14T19:44:34.462Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cbdcc236-0167-4739-a925-0812b5cca283_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2024-08-22T04:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cbdcc236-0167-4739-a925-0812b5cca283_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cbdcc236-0167-4739-a925-0812b5cca283_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e41dad95-50a8-4007-bd59-5a66c4696dcd","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"This fly demonstrated evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction, reduced lifespan, and motor activity differences as seen in individuals with PMD.\n","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4cc1eb61-288b-4e26-b429-f2d99ec84c39","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Drosophila melanogaster knockout model for TTC19 showed low fertility, adult-onset locomotor impairment and bang sensitivity, associated with CIII deficiency.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21278747","rdfs:label":"Ghezzi_fly","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a11f6d81-3929-4653-88cb-d8b0a52df27a","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"This mouse demonstrated evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction (reduced complex III activity and alterations of Complex III assembly).
