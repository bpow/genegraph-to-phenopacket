The patients carried the variant c.1579G>A (p. E527K) in the *SRC* gene, and the variant segregates with the disease phenotypes in the family (PMID: 26936507). The authors demonstrated that E527K was a gain-of-function variant, which resulted in the loss of SRC’s self-inhibitory capacity. Five additional probands have since been identified with the same variant (PMIDs: 31204551, 35349645, 33054137, 36519321, 36507135). Two were *de novo* occurrences (PMIDs: 31204551 and 33054137) and one was a Spanish family with seven patients confirmed to harbor E527K (PMID: 35349645). There is also experimental evidence to support the pathogenicity of this variant, including expression of SRC in hematopoietic cells (PMID: 2419901). Additionally, this mutation caused a defect in megakaryopoiesis from either patient cells or the normal stem cell transduced with this change (PMIDs: 26936507 and 33054137). And a Zebrafish model expressing this variant recapitulated the patient’s blood and bone phenotypes (PMID: 26936507). In summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged.\n\nThis gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the HT GCEP on 02/26/2020. It was reevaluated on 06/22/2022. As a result of this reevaluation, the classification remained at Moderate with the addition of new case-level evidence (PMIDs: 35349645 and 33054137). It was again reevaluated on 06/03/2024. As a result of this reevaluation, the classification remained at Moderate with the addition of new case-level evidence (PMIDs: 36519321 and 36507135).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9a000516-2516-4e60-bd85-c157499533be","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3420133d-7a37-4f76-a3e7-6b9a0bc3803e","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","changes":[{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"},{"id":"cg:sopChange"},{"id":"cg:newEvidence"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3420133d-7a37-4f76-a3e7-6b9a0bc3803e_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2024-06-07T13:10:13.746Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3420133d-7a37-4f76-a3e7-6b9a0bc3803e_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10028","date":"2024-06-03T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["RecurationNewEvidence","RecurationTiming"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3420133d-7a37-4f76-a3e7-6b9a0bc3803e_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3420133d-7a37-4f76-a3e7-6b9a0bc3803e_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9ae2c6a5-5412-4cb6-8910-1f0d0247f7c7","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The expression of the c-src protein in hematopoietic cells experiment showed that platelet lysates contained the highest levels of pp60c-src-specific enolase phosphorylation, 3- to 7-fold higher than the levels detected in brain and peripheral blood lymphocyte (PBL) lysates and at least 30- to 50-fold higher than muscle, spleen, thymus, lymph node, bone marrow, and erythrocyte lysates.","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e022f817-b2b4-432c-bc76-c2dd5a7d9ba5","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Human Blood platelets express high levels of the pp60c-src-specific tyrosine kinase activity.
