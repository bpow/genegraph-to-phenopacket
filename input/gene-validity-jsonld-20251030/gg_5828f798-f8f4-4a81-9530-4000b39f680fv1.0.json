Typical phenotypes of individuals affected with GEFS+ include infantile/childhood-onset febrile and afebrile seizures, which are well-controlled with or without anti-epileptic drugs; intelligence is typically unaffected (PMIDs: 25362483, 27781031, 30737342). However, some individuals in the GEFS+ spectrum of disease may be more severely affected, with phenotypes including infantile-onset epileptic encephalopathy with developmental delays and/or intellectual disability (PMID: 30737342).  Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in inheritance pattern or molecular mechanism between individuals presenting with typical GEFS+ and those presenting with the more severe developmental and epileptic encephalopathy. Therefore, these individuals are being curated together under the single disease term GEFS+ (MONDO:0018214). \n\nTen variants (missense, small in-frame indels, truncations, and frameshift) reported in 10 probands in three publications are included in this curation (PMIDs: 25362483, 27781031, and 30737342). In two of the families, the variants segregated with a total LOD score of 6.38. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by a knockout mouse model that showed heat-induced seizures (PMID: 32858780).\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *STX1B* and autosomal dominant GEFS+. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Epilepsy Gene Curation Expert Panel on June 20, 2023 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5828f798-f8f4-4a81-9530-4000b39f680f","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3b9a9e0e-b3d5-4340-8853-0ae6e7c390fd","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3b9a9e0e-b3d5-4340-8853-0ae6e7c390fd_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10005","date":"2023-09-21T19:50:34.834Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3b9a9e0e-b3d5-4340-8853-0ae6e7c390fd_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10005","date":"2023-06-20T19:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3b9a9e0e-b3d5-4340-8853-0ae6e7c390fd_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3b9a9e0e-b3d5-4340-8853-0ae6e7c390fd_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ba98a382-0fbf-4c86-a802-8515910e37d6","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"This is not a spontaneous seizure phenotype, but susceptibility to seizure with increased temperature.
