Reported cases to date have an adolescent onset and are further characterized by slowly progressive distal muscle atrophy and weakness, distal sensory impairment with decreased reflexes, and variable nerve conduction velocities ranging from the demyelinating to the axonal range. Four missense variants, two of which are de novo, have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least four probands in three separate publications (PMIDs: 23134117, 28642160, 27908631). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in five additional family members in one large family. Although the initial characterization evidence to support pathogenicity, there is a lack of appropriate supporting evidence for the latter two cases. This gene-disease relationship is additionally supported by expression data and functional alteration of human oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (hOPCs). Investigation determined that GNB4 is largely expressed in axons and Schwann cells of neurons, relating to the neurodegenerative phenotypes characteristic of CMT. Additionally, mice with an immunodeficient, demyelinating phenotype were injected with hOPCs both expressing and not expressing GNB4 and found a large increase in the latter's differentiation compared to the controls, suggesting a major role in myelin development and differentiation. Although there is additional evidence available, the lack of the exact mechanism and an animal model limits the scorable data. In summary, there is MODERATE evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Charcot-Marie-Tooth Expert Panel on 02/25/20 (SOP Version 007).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e78d455e-cc44-4a27-80e0-ec516c2cbf30","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a8cecdd7-06d8-4697-8cd9-32900c366371","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a8cecdd7-06d8-4697-8cd9-32900c366371_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10063","date":"2020-04-14T13:20:10.930Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a8cecdd7-06d8-4697-8cd9-32900c366371_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10063","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a8cecdd7-06d8-4697-8cd9-32900c366371_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a8cecdd7-06d8-4697-8cd9-32900c366371_ad_dn_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3b610072-03f8-4849-9148-f611ae1b582b_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Due to the confirmed de novo variant in addition to the ample phenotypic evidence, this proband earns default points.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/78591edc-c3a2-4d16-8349-829b777bfbe7","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27908631","rdfs:label":"LA1","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":10,"detectionMethod":"Genomic samples were isolated and WES was performed and analyzed.

Some myelinated fibers had a target-like appearance. Onion-bulb formations in the sural nerve of the CMT1A control were also densely stained with GB4 antibody. In contrast, GB4 staining was significantly weaker in the sural nerves of the two individuals with the GNB4 mutation than in those of the normal control and the individual with CMT1A.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23434117","rdfs:label":"GNB4 Expression is Altered in Patients","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionB"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1.5}],"evidenceStrength":"Moderate","sequence":539,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria7","strengthScore":6.6,"subject":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/zKfNjx0cTQg","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0015626","gene":"hgnc:20731","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000006"},"version":"1.0","websiteLegacyID":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/assertion_a8cecdd7-06d8-4697-8cd9-32900c366371-","@context":{"@vocab":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"},"curationReasons":{"@type":"@vocab","@container":"@set"},"GCISnapshot":{"@type":"@id"},"dc:isVersionOf":{"@type":"@id"},"websiteLegacyID":{"@type":"@id"}}}
