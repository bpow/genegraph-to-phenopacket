Two missense variants reported in 2 probands in 2 publications are included in this curation (PMID: 28126831, 39836844). One variant, c.1588G>T (p.Asp530Tyr), segregated with disease in a family. This variant is present in population databases at a higher frequency than expected for rare disease. The condition is characterized by elevated IgE, eosinophilic esophagitis, joint hypermobility, and vascular abnormalities. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss of function.\n\nThis gene-disease association is supported by protein interactions and functional assays. ERBIN forms a complex with activated STAT3 and SMAD2/3 (PMID: 28126831). STAT3 and SMAD2/3 have been previously established to be definitely associated with diseases with phenotypes overlapping that of ERBIN deficiency: hyper IgE syndrome and familial thoracic aortic aneurysm and aortic dissection. Normally this complex negatively regulates TGF-β activity, but in patient cells ERBIN fails to sequester SMAD2/3 in the cytoplasm, upregulating TGF-β signaling (PMID: 28126831). TGF-β signaling is critical for controlling human allergic disease.\n\nIn summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the ClinGen SCID/CID GCEP on the meeting date February 20, 2025 (SOP Version 11).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3ba3cf03-8683-4207-9184-48ad79bd9b82","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b7b31c5a-f637-41f6-ba84-dde5e3dc7738","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b7b31c5a-f637-41f6-ba84-dde5e3dc7738_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10081","date":"2025-07-25T16:39:39.493Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b7b31c5a-f637-41f6-ba84-dde5e3dc7738_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10081","date":"2025-02-20T18:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b7b31c5a-f637-41f6-ba84-dde5e3dc7738_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b7b31c5a-f637-41f6-ba84-dde5e3dc7738_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ceaa127e-da13-4323-9d21-5e2b83f62fb7","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9d519117-0761-48e7-ab60-fe670313ce49","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Impaired STAT3–ERBIN complex formation in ERBB2IPmut patient cells was associated with increased nuclear SMAD2/3 levels in primary T cells (Fig.  3  B) and increased nuclear pSMAD2/3 in lymphocytes (Fig. 3, C and D)","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28126831","rdfs:label":"Functional Alteration 1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b7b31c5a-f637-41f6-ba84-dde5e3dc7738_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8d6ba8e0-4bd7-49fd-b22e-6fa6ecd3d376","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/152e1bb2-6e68-4ca3-ba30-14e123669eaf","type":"Finding","dc:description":"By immunoprecipitation, the authors confirmed that, after STAT3 activation and associated induction of ERBIN, a complex containing SMAD2/3 and STAT3 can form and that ERBIN was required, as knockdown prevented this complex from forming","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28126831","rdfs:label":"STAT3 Interaction","demonstrates":{"id":"obo:MI_0915"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/73002f54-60dc-416f-9227-7fb05c58a3c7","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/79154edf-7247-486e-9421-3465830d27fb","type":"Finding","dc:description":"By immunoprecipitation, the authors confirmed that, after STAT3 activation and associated induction of ERBIN, a complex containing SMAD2/3 and STAT3 can form and that ERBIN was required, as knockdown prevented this complex from forming.\n\nSMAD2 is definitely associated with familial thoracic aortic aneurysm and aortic dissection.
