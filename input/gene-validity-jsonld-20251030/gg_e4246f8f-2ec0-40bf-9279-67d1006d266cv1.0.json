PMID:22729223). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Multiple recurrent variants have been identified in this gene, and functional testing in patient cell lines support a gain-of-function disease mechanism. Additional experimental studies have been done on non-patient derived cells and animal models supporting a gain-of-function disease mechanism. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in molecular mechanism(s) AND inheritance pattern. Therefore, the following disease entities have been lumped into one disease entity, Focal cortical dysplasia, type II, somatic (OMIM: 607341), Smith-Kingsmore syndrome (616638). The phenotypic spectrum is largely due to what tissue(s) the variant affects.  In summary, MTOR has been definitively associated with overgrowth syndrome and/or cerebral malformations due to abnormalities in MTOR pathway genes, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Brain Malformations Gene Curation Expert Panel on 05/25/2021.
