First described by Beighton in 1968, classic EDS (formerly known as EDS type I or “gravis” and type II or “mitis”) is a connective tissue disorder characterized by joint hypermobility, skin hyperextensibilty, and skin fragility leading to atrophic scarring (reviewed in Bowen et al, 2017, PMID: 28192633; Malfait et al, 2018, PMID 20301422). This curation includes nineteen unique variants (splicing variants causing in frame deletions, missense variants, one in frame deletion/insertion, and a 3’ terminal frameshift not expected to undergo nonsense-mediated decay) that have been reported in nineteen probands meeting clinical criteria for classic EDS in six publications (Michalickova et al, 1998, PMID: 9425231; Richards et al, 1998, PMID: 9783710; Malfait et al, 2005, PMID: 15580559; Symoens et al, 2012, PMID: 22696272; Ritelli et al, 2013, PMID: 23587214, Watanabe et al, 2016, PMID: 27656288). Of note, none of these variants is predicted to result in lack of protein. Like the other fibrillar collagens, alpha2(V) has a long uninterrupted triple helix of Gly-X-Y repeats. The glycine residues have been shown to be important to the triple helix structure (Long et al, 1993, PMID 8218237; Bella et al, 1994, PMID 7695699; Shoulders and Raines, 2009, PMID 19344236). Ten of the variants curated here cause in frame deletion of 18-36 amino acids in the helical domain, and one is an in frame insertion/deletion. With the exception of one frameshift in the 3’ end of the gene, all of the other variants curated involved missense substitutions of a glycine residue in the helical domain. Alteration or loss of the Gly-X-Y repeats in the helical region is expected to result in a dominant-negative mechanism of disease, with up to 50% of Collagen V chains incorporating an altered alpha2(V) chain. The relationship between COL5A2 and classic EDS is also supported by experimental evidence. This includes the biochemical function of COL5A2 in regulating collagen fiber size in the extra-cellular matrix, which is consistent with the clinical features of the condition (Andrikopoulos et al., 1995, PMID: 7704020; Fichard et al, 1995, PMID: 8535602; the interaction of the gene product of COL5A2 (alpha2(V)) in a triple helical structure with the gene product of COL5A1 (alpha1(V), another gene with a definitive relationship with classic EDS (Bentz H, et al., 1978, PMID: 738278); functional alteration evidence in which fibroblasts and dermis samples from a patient with classic EDS and a COL5A2 variant show abnormalities in collagen solubility and collagen fibril size (Michalickova et al, 1998, PMID: 9425231); the clinical features of animal models including a cow model with skin abnormalities and a COL5A2 variant (Jacinto et al, 2020, PMID: 33143196), a conditional mouse knockout with fragile skin and poor wound-healing (Park et al, 2017, PMID: 28734943), and mouse model with an in frame deletion of the N-telopeptide domain in which homozygotes have fragile, hyperextensible skin (Andrikopoulos et al, 1995, PMID: 7704020). In summary, COL5A2 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant classic EDS. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This gene-disease classification was approved by the General Gene Curation Expert panel on March 24th, 2021.\n\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4603bd24-e795-4899-a87e-d976f5fac77c","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1901d495-d33f-4741-88fd-4b66ac43bbad","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1901d495-d33f-4741-88fd-4b66ac43bbad_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10026","date":"2021-03-24T18:42:45.711Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1901d495-d33f-4741-88fd-4b66ac43bbad_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10026","date":"2021-03-24T18:43:03.011Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1901d495-d33f-4741-88fd-4b66ac43bbad_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1901d495-d33f-4741-88fd-4b66ac43bbad_ad_dn_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d0003784-8740-45d1-84b5-e1858d3eb2ba_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"This individual, with severe features of classic EDS, has a de novo 7 bp deletion in COL5A2, including the consensus AG dinucleotide of the 3′-splice site and the five 5′ nucleotides of the next exon.

These mice had extremely thin skin, with a compact, collagen-dense dermis in which dermal white adipose tissue was not detectable; features are NOT characteristic of classic EDS. Their skin had reduced toughness (as seen in patients with classic EDS) but was not hyperextensible, possibly due to the persistence of some level of normal ECM deposited before tamoxifen treatment. Transmission electron microscopy analysis showed Col5a2 knockdown skin to have the large-diameter cauliflower-contoured collagen fibril aggregates that are pathognomonic of classic EDS. Furthermore, Col5a2 knockdown mice also showed delayed and incomplete healing of wounds, often seen in patients with classic EDS, and had increased aortic diameter, which has also been reported in these patients.

The dermis was of normal thickness, but the collagen fibrils were widely spaced compared to the uniform dense packing of collagen fibrils in normal controls (Fig. 4). Furthermore, the fibrils in the EDS 3 sample were extremely variable in size and shape (Fig. 4). The loose packing of the collagen fibrils in the EDS dermis indicated that the concentration of the fibrillar collagens was reduced. As the proportions of type I to III collagens in the total collagen extracts were not significantly different from control values, it seems that the concentrations of both type I and III collagens were reduced in EDS 3 dermis.\nOf note, the collagen fibrillar architecture and collagen solubility of the bone matrix were normal in EDS 3, suggesting that type V collagen plays a more important role in collagen fibrillogenesis of dermis than that of bone.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9425231","rdfs:label":"Dermal collagens in EDS COL5A2 case"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1901d495-d33f-4741-88fd-4b66ac43bbad_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/35f33ff7-79ad-410c-a7c7-d9a7c2c97c80","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"The role of type V collagen, and hence COL5A2, in the extracellular matrix, is well characterized and well accepted.
