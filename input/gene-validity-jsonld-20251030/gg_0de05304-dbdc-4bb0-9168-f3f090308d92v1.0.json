Parkinson´s disease is a progressive degenerative disorder of the central nervous system characterized by loss of dopamine-producing neurons in the substantia nigra, and Lewy bodies in the substantia nigra and locus coeruleus are found in most cases. Signs and symptoms include tremor, which is most pronounced during rest, muscle rigidity, slowing of voluntary movements (bradykinesia), and a tendency to fall back (postural instability). Several pathogenic variants have been reported in >30 patients by different authors/groups from different ethnicities (Kasten et al. 2018, PMID: 29644727, www.mdsgene.org). The mutational spectrum is broad, including structural variants (exon deletions), nonsense, frameshift, splice site, and missense changes. Four of these publications are included in this curation covering multiplex families with mainly truncating variants. The additional evidence from the literature was not included in this curation because the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The disease follows a recessive mode of inheritance with seemingly full penetrance. This gene-disease association is also supported by recurrent experimental evidence, including animal models and in-vitro functional assays. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be a loss-of-function (LOF) indicated by the many truncating variants. It has further been shown that several of the missense variants are unstable (Görner et al. 2004, PMID: 14607841; Blackinton et al. 2005, PMID: 15790532; Malgieri and Eliezer, PMID: 18436956). *PARK7/DJ-1* encodes a declycase and has pleiotropic functions including roles as a chaperone with protease activity, a transcriptional regulator, and an antioxidant scavenger and redox sensor (Ottolini et al. 2013; PMID: 23418303). DJ-1 is also involved in tumorigenesis and in maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis. The encoded protein may interact with other autosomal-recessive Parkinson´s disease genes, including PRKN (Moore et al. 2005, PMID: 15525661) and PINK1 (Tang et al. 2006, PMID: 16632486). Dj1-null mice showed a significant decrease in locomotor activity upon oxidative stress as well as a significant loss of striatal dopaminergic neurons when compared to control mice. Restoration of Dj1 expression in Dj1-null mice resulted in a protective effect upon oxidative stress (Kim et al. 2005, PubMed: 15784737). In summary, biallelic, pathogenic variants in *PARK7/DJ-1* are definitively causing autosomal-recessive Parkinson´s disease. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/0de05304-dbdc-4bb0-9168-f3f090308d92","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d79439d2-844b-4ba6-aceb-e6b179eaaa01","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d79439d2-844b-4ba6-aceb-e6b179eaaa01_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10079","date":"2022-10-07T14:49:42.956Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d79439d2-844b-4ba6-aceb-e6b179eaaa01_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10079","date":"2022-06-27T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d79439d2-844b-4ba6-aceb-e6b179eaaa01_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d79439d2-844b-4ba6-aceb-e6b179eaaa01_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b605b10e-5952-4305-abb9-8af50f13f785","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8fb69ed1-d572-4329-8328-57bba532e3e0","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Both share bradykinesia and loss of dopaminergic neurons","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15784737","rdfs:label":"DJ-1-Deficient Mice","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/dfab9f85-02ce-4ee4-81d2-864831646892","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/6bb3bec3-e44a-41af-90a1-5e47f9fe30ff","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Expression of DJ-1 in DJ-1 +/+  (Fig. 5 C, D, and G), and DJ-1 -/- (Fig. 5 E–G) mice\nprevented much of the neuronal loss induced by MPTP.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15784737","rdfs:label":"restoration of DJ-1 expression by adenovirus","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:PhenotypeRescue"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanRescueCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d79439d2-844b-4ba6-aceb-e6b179eaaa01_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/3a53048d-d9ee-40c0-9bd5-c9b53e4a22d1","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/590499a7-47a2-45a6-9fae-05069897bc97","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Comparison of the data with those obtained for the wild-type protein shows that the L166P mutation leads to severe and global destabilization and unfolding of the protein structure.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18436956","rdfs:label":"solution state NMR and circular dichroism spectroscopies"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fa010992-51b5-43f0-af83-f1ddc9fe571f","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a1d46f12-ab85-4ea3-879e-df73237146e2","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Western blotting","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14607841","rdfs:label":"Reduced stability of mutated protein"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d79439d2-844b-4ba6-aceb-e6b179eaaa01_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/00e87650-3438-4b5a-b47e-da80d7fe34c2","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/630a26f9-6838-4311-a212-379b940ddaa7","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Interaction of parkin with pathogenic DJ-1 mutants.
