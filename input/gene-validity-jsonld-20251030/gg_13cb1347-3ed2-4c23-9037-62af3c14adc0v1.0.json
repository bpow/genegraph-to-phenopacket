At least three missense variants have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data. \n\nVariants in *ABCB6* have been reported in individuals with the following disease entities: Dyschromatosis universalis hereditaria, Isolated microphthalmia with coloboma, and Familial pseudohyperkalemia. Further, biallelic truncating variants affecting *ABCB6* are responsible for the Lan(-) blood group (MIM#111600). Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found differences in phenotypic variability and no consistent mechanism of disease. Therefore, the following disease entities have been split and curated separately: Dyschromatosis universalis hereditaria (MIM#615402), Isolated microphthalmia with coloboma (MIM#614497). Familial pseudohyperkalemia (MIM#609153) has not been curated at this time as it is an asymptomatic condition apparent only in refrigerated blood samples due to temperature-dependent leak of potassium across the cell membrane of erythrocytes. \n\nThree missense variants in *ABCB6* have been reported in association with isolated microphthalmia with coloboma in three probands across two publications (PMID: 22226084; 24281366). Co-segregation with disease was observed in one family (PMID: 22226084). The mechanism of disease is currently unknown. This gene-disease relationship is supported by a zebrafish model (PMID: 22226084). In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the ClinGen General Inborn Errors of Metabolism GCEP on 22MAR2024 (SOP 10).\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/13cb1347-3ed2-4c23-9037-62af3c14adc0","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/45ec3fba-48fd-4bf4-b865-2c2d7216e8eb","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/45ec3fba-48fd-4bf4-b865-2c2d7216e8eb_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10097","date":"2024-04-26T18:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/45ec3fba-48fd-4bf4-b865-2c2d7216e8eb_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10097","date":"2024-04-26T18:59:05.330Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/45ec3fba-48fd-4bf4-b865-2c2d7216e8eb_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/94610968-b0e8-4399-95c4-2743fd3b4cfe","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/94610968-b0e8-4399-95c4-2743fd3b4cfe_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","dc:description":"The authors used an ABCB6 morpholino in zebrafish and found that they developed a coloboma phenotype.
