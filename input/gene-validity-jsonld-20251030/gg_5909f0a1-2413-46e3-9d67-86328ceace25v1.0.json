Breast cancer (referring to mammary carcinoma) is histopathological and almost certainly etiologically and genetically heterogeneous. Familial occurrence has indicated important genetic factors (OMIM 114480). \nPer the criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in molecular mechanism, inheritance pattern, or phenotypic variability. One variant (*ATRIP*:c.1152_1155del) reported in breast cancer patients in one publication (PMID: 36977412) is included in this curation. \nMore evidence is available in the literature (Wilcox N, et al., PMID: 37592023), reported associations between protein-truncating variants in *ATRIP* and breast \ncancer (P < 1 × 10−4.). \nThe mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss of function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence from in vitro functional assays (PMID: 36977412). Immunohistochemistry and functional studies showed the *ATRIP* c.1152_1155del variant allele is weakly expressed compared to the wild-type allele, and truncated ATRIP fails to perform its normal function to prevent replicative stress.\nIn summary, limited evidence supports the relationship between *ATRIP* and autosomal dominant inheritance Breast cancer susceptibility. This relationship has been demonstrated in patients with monoallelic mutations in *ATRIP* (PMIDs: 36977412, 37592023). The ClinGen Hereditary Cancer GCEP approved this classification on the meeting date of May 24, 2024 (SOP Version 10).\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/5909f0a1-2413-46e3-9d67-86328ceace25","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7d3d3117-9df2-4dbf-a925-e6a77945c8b7","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7d3d3117-9df2-4dbf-a925-e6a77945c8b7_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10023","date":"2024-08-29T20:31:15.911Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7d3d3117-9df2-4dbf-a925-e6a77945c8b7_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10023","date":"2024-08-29T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["ErrorClarification"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7d3d3117-9df2-4dbf-a925-e6a77945c8b7_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7d3d3117-9df2-4dbf-a925-e6a77945c8b7_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/fa5a3dcc-554a-46e9-90db-5e352af65271","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/26d23d01-4e34-4b61-bdf3-502a83be157c","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"ATRIP-deficient cells were more vulnerable to HU and complementation with\nATRIP WT restored viability to the baseline levels (Figure 3E).
