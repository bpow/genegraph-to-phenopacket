Two cases have been identified in two publications (PMIDs: 23242558, 36706222) with homozygous putative loss of function variants (frameshift and start-loss). In addition to the two cases, evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes the experimental data of the role of *PPM1K* as the BCKD complex E1α phosphatase (PMID: 19411760), its interaction with additional MSUD genes *BCKDHA* and *DBT* (PMID: 19411760), its alteration of dephosphorylation in both patient and non-patient cells which could be rescued with WT expression (PMID: 23086801 and PMID: 19411760), a knockdown zebrafish model (PMID: 17374715) with limited relevant characterization, and a knockout mouse (PMID: 19411760 ) which recapitulated the characteristic elevation of branched chain amino acids seen in patients. In summary, there is moderate genetic evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged.\n\nThis gene-disease pair was originally approved by the Aminoacidopathy GCEP on 09/25/2020. It was reevaluated on 10/25/2023. As a result of this reevaluation a second case was identified (PMID: 36706222) and increased the classification from Limited to Moderate (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a61cecca-7077-49f8-b100-43ad48ba2554","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d2b1c4d4-ca12-4456-afe0-f727106afeaf","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","changes":[{"id":"cg:otherTextChange"},{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},{"id":"cg:classificationChange"},{"id":"cg:sopChange"},{"id":"cg:newEvidence"}],"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d2b1c4d4-ca12-4456-afe0-f727106afeaf_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10011","date":"2023-12-22T17:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d2b1c4d4-ca12-4456-afe0-f727106afeaf_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10011","date":"2023-12-22T17:44:11.530Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["RecurationNewEvidence","RecurationTiming"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/d2b1c4d4-ca12-4456-afe0-f727106afeaf_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/30654f57-2278-4eb8-a260-3fa5e1adeb55_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/30654f57-2278-4eb8-a260-3fa5e1adeb55","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23086801","rdfs:label":"Patient 10848","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":21,"allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/b7653488-a5ce-4131-8b3a-4c88664c441e","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_152542.5(PPM1K):c.417_418del (p.Thr140ProfsTer12)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA3005308"}},"detectionMethod":"SNP-array analysis revealed complete LOH for chromosome 4 as a result of paternal UPD.
