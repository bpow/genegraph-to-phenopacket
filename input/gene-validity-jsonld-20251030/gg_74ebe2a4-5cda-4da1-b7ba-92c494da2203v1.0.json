{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/74ebe2a4-5cda-4da1-b7ba-92c494da2203v1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"*BMPR2* was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant congenital heart disease in 2016 (Liu et al., PMID: 27002414; Sicko et al., PMID: 27788187). Another publication in 2012 reported a paternally inherited deletion at 2q33.1 of about 34 kb, falling into the first intron of the *BMPR2* (PMID: 21457232). Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in molecular mechanism, inheritance pattern, and phenotypic variability. Therefore, congenital heart disease, Ebstein anomaly, and conotruncal defects have been lumped into one disease entity. One proband with a noncanonical splice-site variant is included in this curation (PMID: 27002414). At least eight other unique variants (missense, frameshifts, splice site) reported in five probands in five publications were not scored due to their high minor allele frequency (> 0.00001) in gnomAD v2.1.1 or a low REVEL score (PMIDs: 27788187, 27002414, 28991257, 33448881, 35910219). The gene-disease relationship is supported by two mouse models and expression data (PMIDs: 23352489, 12441304, 19409885). In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. Of note, *BMPR2* has been classified as definitive for autosomal dominant pulmonary arterial hypertension by the Pulmonary Hypertension GCEP in December 2020. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Congenital Heart Disease GCEP on the meeting date 9/11/2023 (SOP Version 9).\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/74ebe2a4-5cda-4da1-b7ba-92c494da2203","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1b4322da-10a2-46c4-be0c-b5163ab5f401","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Limited","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1b4322da-10a2-46c4-be0c-b5163ab5f401_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10130","date":"2023-09-18T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1b4322da-10a2-46c4-be0c-b5163ab5f401_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10130","date":"2023-09-18T17:32:56.273Z","role":"Publisher"}],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1b4322da-10a2-46c4-be0c-b5163ab5f401_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/1b4322da-10a2-46c4-be0c-b5163ab5f401_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/15575114-a9f1-4099-809d-f569c855a154","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Genotype does not match human patients","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4b502764-00c4-456e-a178-1fec82b9e71c","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Homozygous mutants die at mid-gestation with cardiovascular and skeletal defects, demonstrating that the development of these tissues requires wild-type levels of BMP signaling.
