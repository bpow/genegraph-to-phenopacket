{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e0cda779-2943-4753-94c1-0497ab2c70eav1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"The *DRC1* (*Dynein Regulatory Complex Subunit 1*) gene, also known as *CCDC164*, was first reported in relation to PCD patients by Wirschell et al in 2013 (PMID: 23354437). Earlier work by Carlén et al. in 2003 (PMID: 12746204) had described three PCD patients with shared ultrastructural defects in their ciliary axonemes: an absence of the nexin links that connect the nine outer microtubule doublets of the ciliary and flagellar axonemes. Wirschell et al. elaborated on this PCD study by showing that loss-of-function variants disrupting *DRC1* in human patients resulted in severe defects in the assembly of what is now referred to as the nexin-dynein regulatory complex (N-DRC), a key regulator of ciliary and flagellar motor activity. In addition to bridging neighboring doublet microtubules, the N-DRC restricts their sliding motions, converting dynein-generated sliding motion into ciliary bending motion (PMID: 3771483). The DRC1 protein is one of 12 subunits of the N-DRC (PMID: 37714832). DRC1, DRC2 (CCDC65), and DRC4 (GAS8) are considered scaffold proteins of the N-DRC and play a vital role in assembling the N-DRC. Defects in each of these subunits have been associated with PCD (PMIDs: 23354437, 24094744, 26387594).\n\nThe specific disease entity associated with *DRC1* is primary ciliary dyskinesia 21, an autosomal recessive disorder caused by homozygous or compound heterozygous variants in the *DRC1* gene. Individuals with PCD due to *DRC1* variants present with upper and lower respiratory infection, infertility, and consistently demonstrate low levels of nasal nitric oxide. They do not exhibit situs inversus, a hallmark of many forms of PCD. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping & Splitting Working Group, we found the molecular mechanism and autosomal recessive mode of inheritance to be consistent among unrelated patients, while the phenotypic variability among them appeared to represent a spectrum of disease rather than separate disease entities. Therefore, cases caused by inherited *DRC1* variants have been lumped into a single disease entity, primary ciliary dyskinesia 21 (MONDO:0014123, OMIM # 615294).\n\nThe mechanism of pathogenicity in primary ciliary dyskinesia 21 appears to be biallelic *DRC1* loss of function. This curation has evaluated genetic evidence from ten probands reported in seven publications (PMIDs: 23354437, 36856967, 34089056, 32108610, 35873463, 31270959, 34815526). Six unique variants were scored from nine probands (four nonsense, one large 27,748 bp deletion spanning exons 1-4, and one 6,119 bp deletion spanning exon 2 that results in a frameshift mutation). Of note: The *DRC1* exon 1–4 deletion (NC_000002.12:g.26398040_26425787del) is a founder variant that causes PCD in Korean and Japanese populations (PMID: 39152285) and is the most prevalent variant in Japanese PCD patients (PMID: 36864285). The *DRC1* p.Gln118Ter variant (NM_145038.5:c.352C>T) was reported in five different probands, although it has not yet been identified as a founder mutation (PMIDs: 34089056, 36856967, 23354437, 34851034). Two publications report human patients with biallelic *DRC1* variants with male infertility and no respiratory symptoms (PMIDs: 39780445, 34169321). It remains unclear whether mild respiratory phenotypes were overlooked or misinterpreted as normal as these studies did not incorporate comprehensive pulmonary assessments or investigate respiratory ciliary structure or function in these patients. These patients were not scored in this curation.\n\nThe gene-disease association between *DRC1* and PCD 21 is also supported by gene expression data that show *DRC1* expression in ciliated tissues. GTEx RNA-seq expression studies in reference human tissues show strong expression of *DRC1* in lung, testis, brain, and fallopian tube (PMID: 23715323). This pattern is consistent with DRC1 as a subunit of the N-DRC in motile cilia and flagella (sperm). DRC1 together with DRC2 (CCDC65), and DRC4 (GAS8) are considered scaffold proteins in the assembly of the N-DRC. Cryo–electron tomography and structural labeling studies were used to characterize the elongated configuration of these proteins and their role as the backbone of the N-DRC (PMID: 25411337). Velocity sedimentation of NaI extracts from wild-type versus mutant *Chlamydomonas* axonemes on sucrose density gradients show that extracts derived from axonemes mutant for either *drc1* or *drc4* have a disrupted N-DRC structure with drc1 and drc4 sedimenting separately at different rates while wild-type extracts have drc1 and drc4 sedimenting together as one large complex (PMID: 23354437). Coimmunoprecipitation studies in human HEK293 cells confirm an interaction between DRC1 and DRC2 as well as DRC1 and DRC4 (PMID: 34169321). \n \nTwo non-human experimental models have been used to support the gene-disease relationship between *DRC1* and PCD 21.  *Chlamydomonas* cells with loss-of-function *drc1* mutations exhibit abnormal ciliary motility and have an absence of or defective N-DRC assembly (PMID:23354437). In *Chlamydomonas*, the absence of drc1 results in reduced swimming speed, while in humans, respiratory epithelial cells show signs of impaired ciliary movement (reduced bending capacity, altered ciliary beat frequency), and likely mucociliary clearance (upper and lower respiratory symptoms). Mice carrying loss-of-function *Drc1* mutations were created with two different genetic backgrounds. *Drc1* mutant mice in the highly inbred C57BL/6 line exhibited clear signs of growth retardation and hydrocephalus and died before puberty.  Hydrocephalus is a common finding in mouse PCD models, occurring due to the defective function of motile cilia lining the ventricles of the brain. *Drc1* mutations in a hybrid C57BL/6 x ICR line allowed for some mice to reach adulthood for further phenotyping. Mice that survived to adulthood did not exhibit hydrocephalus or decreased size and show signs of male infertility due to severe sperm tail defects (PMID:34169321). In addition to sperm with abnormal morphology, both human patients and mutant mice have defective respiratory cilia, lacking the N-DRC and exhibiting altered ciliary motility.\n \nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting a gene-disease relationship between variants in *DRC1* and primary ciliary dyskinesia 21. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both research and diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time without the emergence of contradictory evidence. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Motile Ciliopathy GCEP on March 13th, 2025 (SOP Version 11).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e0cda779-2943-4753-94c1-0497ab2c70ea","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ef37e7a5-e14e-4c71-8231-b01bd636b2b9","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ef37e7a5-e14e-4c71-8231-b01bd636b2b9_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10102","date":"2025-03-13T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ef37e7a5-e14e-4c71-8231-b01bd636b2b9_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10102","date":"2025-03-31T19:01:02.759Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ef37e7a5-e14e-4c71-8231-b01bd636b2b9_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ef37e7a5-e14e-4c71-8231-b01bd636b2b9_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/4aa73317-b763-4ab1-abf1-bdbf7a7aeb09","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Down-scored because a Chlamydomonas model is unable to recapitulate the respiratory and infertility phenotypes seen in humans with DCR1-related PCD.","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/76aa4f24-e3f5-4d09-82f6-44e4f04175a6","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Both human and Chlamydomonas cells with loss-of-function DRC1 mutations exhibit abnormal ciliary motility and have an absence of or defective N-DRC assembly.

Authors subsequently excluded other genetic causes of PCD (DNAH5, DNAI1, CCDC39, CCDC40, C21orf59, DNAAF1, DNAAF2, DNAAF3, DNAAF4, DNAAF5, LRRC6, SPAG1, ZMYND10, CCNO, RSPH1, RSPH3, RSPH9, RSPH4A, ARMC4, CCDC103, CCDC151, DNAI2, DNAL1, NME8, CCDC114, PIH1D3, DNAJB13, TTC25).","firstTestingMethod":"Next generation sequencing panels","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0011109","obo:HP_0006510","obo:HP_0002110","obo:HP_0033036","obo:HP_0011950","obo:HP_0002094","obo:HP_0003251","obo:HP_0002257","obo:HP_0031245"],"secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/869dfd72-d6f8-415c-9199-85cec5afe118_variant_evidence_item"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":10163,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria11","strengthScore":17,"subject":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/nNnhIt0U6Q4","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0014123","gene":"hgnc:24245","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","websiteLegacyID":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/assertion_ef37e7a5-e14e-4c71-8231-b01bd636b2b9-","@context":{"@vocab":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"},"curationReasons":{"@type":"@vocab","@container":"@set"},"GCISnapshot":{"@type":"@id"},"dc:isVersionOf":{"@type":"@id"},"websiteLegacyID":{"@type":"@id"}}}
