Individuals with heterozygous deletions of this region have phenotypes including intellectual disability, global developmental delays, autism spectrum disorder, and seizures (see the following dosage sensitivity curations for more information: [https://search.clinicalgenome.org/kb/gene-dosage/region/ISCA-46295](url), [https://search.clinicalgenome.org/kb/gene-dosage/region/ISCA-37411](url)). \n\nHeterozygous sequence variants in *OTUD7A* have been observed in individuals with autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia (PMIDs: 29395074, 35931052). Because these phenotypes do not include epilepsy, the Epilepsy GCEP is not evaluating the gene-disease relationship for heterozygous OTUD7A sequence variants.\n\nBiallelic variants in *OTUD7A* were first reported in a patient with autosomal recessive complex neurodevelopmental disorder (MONDO:0100038) in 2020 (PMID: 31997314). This patient was found to have a homozygous p.Leu233Phe variant, and presented with global developmental delay, epilepsy, and hypotonia (PMID:29395074). The mechanism of pathogenicity is not clear at this time, but it has been suggested that the p.Leu233Phe variant results in loss of function (PMID:31997314). Later, another patient with a frameshift variant and the typical 15q13.3 deletion was reported with intellectual disability, epilepsy, global developmental delays, and dysmorphic features (PMID:33381903). This case has not been awarded points as part of our curation.\n\nIn summary, there is limited evidence to support the relationship between biallelic variants in *OTUD7A* and autosomal recessive complex neurodevelopmental disorder. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Epilepsy Gene Curation Expert Panel on the meeting date June 6, 2023 (SOP Version 9).","*OTUD7A* is one of the genes within the recurrent 15q13.3 region.
