{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bd5f66a2-2bce-40ca-be5d-f1f10500d706v1.1","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"*SPATA7* was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive retinal dystrophy in 2009 (Wang et al., PMID: 19268277). Affected individuals with *SPATA7*-related retinopathy show a wide range of age at onset, with a subset of cases presenting in infancy and others developing symptoms later in life. Common clinical features include nystagmus and severe visual loss, but significant inter- and inta-familial phenotypic variability has been described, including diagnoses of Leber congenital amaurosis and retinitis pigmentosa with variable age at onset. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping & Splitting Working Group, the mode of inheritance (autosomal recessive) and molecular mechanism (biallelic *SPATA7* disruption) were found to be consistent among patients diagnosed with Leber congenital amaurosis 3 (MIM# 604232) or retinitis pigmentosa 94, variable age at onset, autosomal recessive (MIM# 604232). The phenotypic variability between cases appears to represent a spectrum of disease rather than separate disease entities. Therefore, cases caused by inherited biallelic *SPATA7* variants have been lumped into a single disease entity, referred to as SPATA7-related retinopathy.\n\nNine variants (two nonsense, four frameshift, two missense and one in-frame indel) that have been reported in ten probands in six publications (PMIDs: 19268277, 22136677, 26854980, 29411205, 28481129, 21310915) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be biallelic loss-of-function.\n\nThis gene-disease association is also supported by expression studies showing that *SPATA7* is expressed in multiple layers of the mouse retina (PMID: 19268277). More specifically, Eblimit et. al. show that *SPATA7* is localized to the connecting cilium of hTERT RPE-1 cells and mouse photoreceptors. This same group also provides evidence that *SPATA7* interacts with RPGRIP1, a protein that has previously been implicated in an X-linked form of retinal dystrophy. Finally, the relevant publication also discusses the findings in a *Spata7*-null mouse model. Mutant mice had severely reduced outer nuclear layer thickness, defective light response as measured by electroretinogram (ERG), as well as a reduction in expression and mislocalization of the RPGRIP1 and RHO proteins (PMID: 25398945). Another *Spata7* knockout mouse model supports these results (PMID: 35368022).\n\nIn summary, *SPATA7* is definitively associated with autosomal recessive SPATA7-related retinopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time without the emergence of contradictory evidence. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Retina Gene Curation Expert Panel on August 1, 2024 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bd5f66a2-2bce-40ca-be5d-f1f10500d706","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9c0c6cda-eb17-47a6-8e9d-bbafd4330295","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Definitive","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9c0c6cda-eb17-47a6-8e9d-bbafd4330295_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10072","date":"2024-10-01T01:10:15.962Z","role":"Publisher"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9c0c6cda-eb17-47a6-8e9d-bbafd4330295_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10072","date":"2024-08-01T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9c0c6cda-eb17-47a6-8e9d-bbafd4330295_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/9c0c6cda-eb17-47a6-8e9d-bbafd4330295_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2112f061-22aa-43bc-98d3-02394b963b7a","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/2029c229-f486-40f5-ab19-e8b90e1ba36e","type":"Finding","dc:description":"We examined the expression pattern of Spata7 in the mouse retina at several developmental stages, using both mRNA ISH and IHC.

At that time, retinal pigmentary changes were observed by funduscopy and there was an abnormal ERG. We performed complete examinations at ages 9,11,13,17 and 21. At age 9, best-corrected visual acuities were 20/25 (with a −1.50 refraction) OD and 20/32 (with a −1.25 +0.50 × 180° refraction) OS. Color vision with a Farnsworth D15 panel was normal. There was no nystagmus or anterior segment abnormalities. Funduscopy showed a waxy-appearing optic nerve head, minimal vessel attenuation, a bull’s eye-like change in the macula and a tigroid appearance to the periphery. A standard full-field ERG showed reduced rod-mediated b-wave amplitudes, mixed cone-rod ERG with reduced a- and b-waves, and non-detectable cone-mediated responses (Figure 1A). Kinetic fields with the V-4e target were limited to a small (<5°) central island of vision and a midperipheral island of vision (Figure 1B). The ERG and visual field data were consistent with a cone-rod dystrophy (CRD).8,9 Serial data over 12 years showed progressive loss of the midperipheral island of vision by kinetic perimetry and further constriction of the residual central island (Figure 1B). By age 17, vision was detectable only near fixation. Visual acuity remained stable but refractive error became more myopic by about 1.50 diopters.","previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"Molecular screening for mutations in 163 retinal disease genes was performed by next generation sequencing (See Supplementary Table 1).
