At least seven unique missense variants  have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least eight probands in six publications (PMIDs:  29117459,  17311506, 25567036, 19237732, 21937696, 36232816). This gene-disease relationship is supported by its biochemical function in the P2Y12 receptor stimulation induced rapid activation of Rap1 (PMID: 16236484), expression A evidence of P2Y12 receptor is selectively expressed in platelets (PMID: 11196645), expression B evidence of reduced P2Y12 receptor expression in patients ( PMID: 21937696), functional alteration in both patient ( PMID: 17311506) and non-patient cells ( PMID: 29117459,  PMID: 23387322), and non-human model organism knock-in mouse models (PMID: 36232816). In summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged.\n\nThis gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the Hemostasis Thrombosis GCEP on 08/26/2020.
