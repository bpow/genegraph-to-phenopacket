Dysplasia of the proximal femoral epiphyses is a relatively milder form of the other skeletal disorders associated with *COL2A1*. It is generally characterized by avascular necrosis of the femoral head, cystic changes of the femoral head, and/or sclerosis of the femoral head. Cases include patients diagnosed with multiple epiphyseal dysplasia with severe proximal femoral dysplasia, avascular necrosis of the femoral head (ANFH), Legg-Calvé-Perthes Disease (LCPD), and Namaqualand hip dysplasia (NHD). 9 variants (missense) that have been reported in 14 probands in 12 publications (PMIDs: 15930420, 17394019, 18512791, 20131279, 24949742, 25050885, 25124518, 29750297, 30740902, 32071555, 33404007, 34088323) are included in this curation.

This gene-disease association is also supported by experimental evidence (expression and functional alteration studies) (PMIDs: 3033664, 7806485, 20204389). In summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *COL2A1* and dysplasia of the proximal femoral epiphyses.

Dysplasia of the proximal femoral epiphyses is a relatively milder form of the other skeletal disorders associated with *COL2A1*.

Cases include patients diagnosed with multiple epiphyseal dysplasia with severe proximal femoral dysplasia, avascular necrosis of the femoral head (ANFH), Legg-Calvé-Perthes Disease (LCPD), and Namaqualand hip dysplasia (NHD). Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found differences in molecular mechanisms and phenotypic variability. Therefore, the following disease entities have been split into multiple disease entities, *COL2A1*-related spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia (OMIM:609162, OMIM:183900, OMIM:184254, OMIM:184250), dysplasia of the proximal femoral epiphyses (OMIM:608805, OMIM:150600), spondyloperipheral dysplasia (OMIM:271700), Stickler syndrome type 1 (OMIM:108300), Kniest dysplasia (OMIM:156550), Achondrogenesis type II (OMIM:200610), and platyspondylic skeletal dysplasia, Torrance type (OMIM:151210). The split curations have been curated separately. 9 variants (missense) that have been reported in 14 probands in 12 publications (PMIDs: 15930420, 17394019, 18512791, 20131279, 24949742, 25050885, 25124518, 29750297, 30740902, 32071555, 33404007, 34088323) are included in this curation.
