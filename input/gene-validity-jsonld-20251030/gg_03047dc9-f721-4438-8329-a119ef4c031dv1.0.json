ZIP4 transports dietary zinc into enterocytes, and eventually arrive to target tissues and organs through blood circulation system. \nSLC39A4 was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive acrodermatitis enteropathica (AE) in 2002 (Wang et al., PMID: 11254458). The affected individuals typically present early onset erosive, inflammatory, erythematous and psoriatic skin lesions at periorofacial, perianal and acral regions. They may also exhibit sparse hair or alopecia, diarrhea, irritability, and growth delay. Most patients show reduced serum zinc levels. Twenty-one unique variants including missense, nonsense, frameshift, and splicing variants that have been reported in 19 unrelated probands are included in this curation  (PMIDs: 11254458, 12032886, 12787121, 23430849, 26351177, 36479285, 32442281, 34625996, 31987033, 21165302, 21762381, 17573886, 28056538, 19416256, 18684156, 24962159, 30980548). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. \nThe mechanism of pathogenicity is known to be loss-of-function. This gene-disease association is also supported by experimental evidence. Tamoxifen-induced intestine-ZIP4 knockout (KO) mice showed rapid weight loss, growth failure and early death, which could be rescued by addition of zinc in drinking water (PMID: 22737083). Zinc levels in the intestine, pancreas and liver were lower in KO mice than the control littermates. Loss-of-function of intestine ZIP4 leads to progressive and profound disorganization of villus and crypt architecture in intestine (PMID 22737083). Studies in cultured human keratinocytes and reconstituted skin model demonstrated that knockdown ZIP4 decreased the zinc in basal layer of epidermis, disrupted normal skin cell differentiation and epidermis formation, downregulated p63 expression and trafficking. This suggested that ZIP4 is involved in maintaining zinc homeostasis and epidermis development through regulating p63 activity and localization, and p63 downstream target genes (PMID: 27940220). Overexpression of AE-associated ZIP4 variants located in extracellular domain or transmembrane domains led to reduced zinc uptake and diminished membrane surface localization. The dysfunction of the ZIP4 mutant protein resulted from impaired glycosylation and retention in the ER (PMID: 14709598, 33837739). \nIn summary, SLC39A4 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive acrodermatitis enteropathica. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen IEM GCEP on the meeting date September 13, 2024.
