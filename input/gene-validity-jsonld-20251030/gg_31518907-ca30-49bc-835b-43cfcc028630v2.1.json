Later publications report patients presenting with both phenotypes favoring the lumping of these two disease entities (PMIDs:27076228 , 28302518) as PIK3R1-related immunodeficiency and SHORT syndrome. SHORT syndrome is a rare disorder characterised by short stature, hyperextensibility of joints and/or hernias, ocular depression, Rieger anomaly and delays of tooth eruption, which provide the condition's acronym. In addition, there is a recognisable facial gestalt, insulin resistance, nephrocalcinosis and hearing deficits. Speech development is often delayed but cognition is usually normal. Also known as activated PI3K-δ syndrome 2 (APDS2), immunodeficieny 36 is a primary immunodeficiency with a highly heterogeneous clinical phenotype. This disease is characterized primarily by recurrent respiratory tract infections, lymphoproliferation, and antibody deficiency. Other features include growth retardation, mild neurodevelopmental delay, and autoimmunity. At least 7 unique PIK3R1 variants (splice donor and splice acceptor) have been reported in humans with APDS2 or APDS2 plus SHORT syndrome and at least 7 additional (missense, frameshift, and nonsense) variants have been reported in SHORT syndrome patients. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. \n*PIK3R1* encodes p85α which regulates the catalytic subunit p110δ (encoded by *PIK3CD*) for the main class I PI3K in leukocytes. The first one binds to the second one by the inter-SH2 domain. Therefore, mutations that lead to the loss of this domain of the protein impair its binding ability and the formation of heterodimers. The consequence in lymphocytes is that the p110δ catalytic subunit is deregulated and over-activated, resulting in an increase of the PI3K signaling-dependent processes.\nSummary of Case Level Data: Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 19 probands in at least 5 publications (PMIDs: 23810378, 23810382, 25133428, 25488983, 27076228, 27221134, 28302518). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts) has been reached.\nEXPERIMENTAL EVIDENCE: This gene-disease association is supported by its function in regulation of immunity, growth, and metabolism as part of the PI3K pathway (PMID: 16847462) where it interacts with *PIK3CD* (PMID: 9113989). As well as the functional alteration studies in patient cells (PMID: 25133428, PMID:25488983,  PMID: 23810379). Lucas et al. (2014) found that heterozygous PIK3R1 mutations promote pathological, constitutive hyperactivation of PI3K and AKT, which leads to activation of the mTORC1 complex and phosphoinhibition of GSK3α/β and FOXO1/3. However, insulin stimulation of the PI3K pathway was reduced. Additionally, a knockout mouse model (PMID: 11062485) supports the role of *PIK3R1* in related pathways and a knockin model (PMID: 26974159) recapitulated features of SHORT syndrome.\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between *PIK3R1* and autosomal dominant immunodeficiency and SHORT syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. \n\nOf note, *PIK3R1* has also been associated with autosomal recessive Agammaglobulinemia 7. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found differences in molecular mechanism, inheritance pattern, and phenotypic variability. Agammaglobulinemia 7 (OMIM: 615214) has been curated separately. ","*PIK3R1* was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant SHORT syndrome in 2013 (PMIDs: 23810382, 23810379, 23810378) and with immunodeficiency 36 in 2014 (PMID: 25133428). Subsequent publications report patients presenting with overlapping features of both conditions, supporting the lumping of these entities into a single disease spectrum referred to as *PIK3R1*-related immunodeficiency and SHORT syndrome (PMIDs: 27076228, 28302518). SHORT syndrome is a rare disorder characterized by short stature, hyperextensibility of joints and/or hernias, ocular depression, Rieger anomaly and delays of tooth eruption, which provide the condition's acronym. In addition, there is a recognizable facial gestalt, insulin resistance, nephrocalcinosis and hearing deficits. Speech development is often delayed but cognition is usually normal. Also known as activated PI3K-δ syndrome 2 (APDS2), immunodeficiency 36 is a primary immunodeficiency with a highly heterogeneous clinical phenotype. This disease is characterized primarily by recurrent respiratory tract infections, lymphoproliferation, and antibody deficiency. Other features include growth retardation, mild neurodevelopmental delay, and autoimmunity. \n\nAt least 7 unique *PIK3R1* variants (splice donor and splice acceptor) have been reported in humans with APDS2 or APDS2 plus SHORT syndrome and at least 7 additional (missense, frameshift, and nonsense) variants have been reported in SHORT syndrome patients, predominately in the C-terminal SH2 domain. All reported variants associated with APDS2 or SHORT syndrome produce altered protein products, rather than leading to loss of protein expression, with pathogenicity arising from disruption of specific functional domains. \n\n*PIK3R1* encodes the p85α subunit, which regulates the catalytic subunit p110δ (encoded by *PIK3CD)* for the main class I PI3K in leukocytes. This interaction occurs via the inter-SH2 domain, which is essential for heterodimer formation and inhibition of PI3K activity in the basal state. Mutations that disrupt this domain impair binding and heterodimer formation. As a result, the p110δ catalytic subunit becomes deregulated and overactivated in lymphocytes, leading to increased PI3K signaling-dependent processes. The common exon 10 skipping variant results in an in-frame deletion of amino acids 434–475, which is not subject to nonsense-mediated decay. This deletion disrupts the inter-SH2 domain and produces a truncated protein that abolishing p85α-mediated inhibition of p110δ leading to hyperactivation of PI3K signaling. \n\nSummary of Case Level Data: Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 19 probands in at least 5 publications (PMIDs: 23810378, 23810382, 25133428, 25488983, 27076228, 27221134, 28302518).

Following stimulation with an anti-CD3 antibody, the level of phosphorylation of AKT at Ser473 in patients’ cells was comparable to that in control cells when analyzed by immunoblotting but consistently higher in patients’ cells than in control cells when analyzed by flow cytometry. Phosphorylation of AKT was also higher in patients’ cells than in control cells following a 30-minute stimulation with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies when analyzed by flow cytometry. Phosphorylation of AKT was no longer detected by flow cytometry in patients’ or control cells when the PI3Kδ inhibitor IC87114 was present in a high concentration during the activation or added for the last 20 minutes of stimulation. Lower concentrations of the inhibitor strongly but not completely abrogated phosphorylation of AKT at Ser473, arguing for p110δ-independent AKT phosphorylation.
