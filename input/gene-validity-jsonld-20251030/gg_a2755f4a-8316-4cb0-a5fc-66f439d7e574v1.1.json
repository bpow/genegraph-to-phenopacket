Three variants (two nonsense and one missense) that have been reported in four probands across three publications (PMIDs: 30715372, 32870709, 36672924) are included in this curation. The mechanism of pathogenicity is reported to be loss of function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by expression data (PMID: 23715323). In summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hereditary Cardiovascular Disease GCEP on the meeting date 09/28/2023 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a2755f4a-8316-4cb0-a5fc-66f439d7e574","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f1d4ce43-4c2d-41a0-b821-a11ac8eb8fca","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","changes":{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f1d4ce43-4c2d-41a0-b821-a11ac8eb8fca_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10104","date":"2023-09-28T16:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f1d4ce43-4c2d-41a0-b821-a11ac8eb8fca_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10104","date":"2023-10-10T20:56:18.489Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["NewCuration"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f1d4ce43-4c2d-41a0-b821-a11ac8eb8fca_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/faae44bd-b0ab-403f-96a4-2eef99bc0c6d_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/faae44bd-b0ab-403f-96a4-2eef99bc0c6d","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30715372","rdfs:label":"Family B V:2","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":36,"allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c045793f-1bc5-4e33-8101-1e7ad0536f27","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_017644.3(KLHL24):c.917G>A (p.Arg306His)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA2721630"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"ICD at 35yo, normal sinus rhythm, Small left ventricular cavity, LV end-diastolic volume (mL)=37, Septal wall thickness (cm)=2.2, Posterior wall thickness (cm)=1.9, EF=67%","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001962","obo:HP_0005157","obo:HP_0002875","obo:HP_0001653"],"previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"linkage mapping of 5 phenotypically affected individuals, CNV analysis","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a3baab67-6f84-42d5-9f98-fd362d560c38_variant_evidence_item","type":"VariantObservation","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30715372","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/c045793f-1bc5-4e33-8101-1e7ad0536f27"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"cg:GermlineAlleleOrigin"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"}}},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/a3baab67-6f84-42d5-9f98-fd362d560c38","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"MAF=0.00003604 with 4/111002 alleles in the European NF population. 0 homozygotes.
