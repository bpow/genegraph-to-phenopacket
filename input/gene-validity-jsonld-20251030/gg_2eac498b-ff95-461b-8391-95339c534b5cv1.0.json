One variant (frameshift) that has been reported in one proband with persistent truncus arteriosus in one publication (PMID: 25713110) is included in this curation. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss-of-function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence (a mouse model; PMID: 12852851). In the mouse model, the mutant mice exhibit ventricular septal defect, persistent truncus arteriosus, and anomalous origin of the coronary arteries. In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Congenital Heart Disease GCEP on the meeting date 3/5/2024 (SOP Version 10).
