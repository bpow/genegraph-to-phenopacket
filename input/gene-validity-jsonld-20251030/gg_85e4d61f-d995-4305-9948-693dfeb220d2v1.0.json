ILD can be described as a family of many lung disorders including idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (IIP) and pneumonitis to the more severe idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). The most common phenotypes of ILD may include shortness of breath, cough, dyspnea, pulmonary fibrosis, and respiratory failure. Sixteen unique variants, all missense, have been reported in 22 probands across five publications (Legendre et al., 2020, PMID: 32855221; van Moorsel et al., 2015, PMID:26568241; Wang et al., 2009, PMID:19100526; Liu L, et al., 2020, PMID:32602668; Sutton et al., 2022, PMID:36135709).  \n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence including an expression study that shows a high degree of specificity in the lung tissue (PMID:23715323). Other experimental evidence includes a biochemical function assay that explains how endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is associated with the development and progression of fibrotic diseases, including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (Burman et al., 2018, PMID:29567124). Functional alteration studies of variants in A549 cells and type II alveolar cells have been shown to lead to protein instability and increased ER stress (Maitra M et al., PMID: 20466729). In summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *SFTPA2* and autosomal dominant ILD. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Interstitial Lung Disease GCEP on June 20, 2023 (SOP Version 9).
