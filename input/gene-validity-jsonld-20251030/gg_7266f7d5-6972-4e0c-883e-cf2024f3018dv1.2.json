Unlike Unverricht – Lundborg disease patients, all of 4 affected individuals do not have repeat expansion variants but have homozygous nonsense variant or homozygous frameshift variant, which is predicted to cause a loss of function of the protein. In summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease association. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Epilepsy Gene Curation Expert Panel by 12/1/2020. As of 8/13/2024, this record underwent administrative updates to edit a typo in the evidence summary. No new evidence has been reviewed or added.\n\nLumping and Splitting: Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found differences in phenotypic variability between three disease entities: (1) Unverricht – Lundborg syndrome(EPM1) (MONDO:0009698), and (2) developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (MONDO:0100062). Therefore, we have split curations for the disease entities, (1) Unverricht – Lundborg syndrome(EPM1) (MONDO:0009698), and (2) developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (MONDO:0100062).\n","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/7266f7d5-6972-4e0c-883e-cf2024f3018d","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/accafcd4-ba3c-4049-9285-1de877d256ec","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","changes":{"id":"cg:summaryChange"},"contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/accafcd4-ba3c-4049-9285-1de877d256ec_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10005","date":"2020-12-01T06:00:00.000Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/accafcd4-ba3c-4049-9285-1de877d256ec_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10005","date":"2024-08-13T19:55:17.348Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasons":["ErrorClarification"],"evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/accafcd4-ba3c-4049-9285-1de877d256ec_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/accafcd4-ba3c-4049-9285-1de877d256ec_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f1aa47d4-5b78-4f0c-82c2-cf7ac1a41126_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/f1aa47d4-5b78-4f0c-82c2-cf7ac1a41126","type":"Proband","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26843564","rdfs:label":"Mancini patient 2","allele":{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/cb09617b-2599-4180-bd1a-d3ddc6ef72bf","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000100.4(CSTB):c.202C>T (p.Arg68Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA314304"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"head circumference of 34 cm (21.5 SD), which dropped to 22.7 SD at age 3 months and to 24.6 SD at age 1.7 years.
