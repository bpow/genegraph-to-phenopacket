{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8ad17e07-e8b8-4746-8ea4-4741834f2b52v1.0","type":"EvidenceStrengthAssertion","dc:description":"The relationship between ATP5MD (up until recently referred to as USMG5 and/or DAPIT) and Leigh syndrome spectrum was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of July 13, 2020. The ATP5MD gene encodes a subunit of the mitochondrial ATP synthase, also known as complex V of the oxidative phosphorylation system. Defects of this protein lead to a reduction of ATP synthesis.\n\nThe ATP5MD gene has been reported in relation to autosomal recessive Leigh syndrome spectrum in a single publication in 2018 (PMID: 29917077). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included one homozygous variant identified in three cases in one publication (PMID: 29917077). No segregation data were available. Loss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease association is also supported by expression data, functional alteration in patient cells, functional alteration in non-patient cells, rescue in patient cells, and a model system (PMIDs: 18853439, 30240627, 21345788, 31127358,  29917077). \n\nIn summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on July 13, 2020 (SOP Version 7).","dc:isVersionOf":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/8ad17e07-e8b8-4746-8ea4-4741834f2b52","GCISnapshot":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ff19a86d-404a-464e-8da6-8824ce45ed20","calculatedEvidenceStrength":"Moderate","contributions":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ff19a86d-404a-464e-8da6-8824ce45ed20_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2020-08-27T16:42:52.070Z","role":"Approver"},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ff19a86d-404a-464e-8da6-8824ce45ed20_publish_contrib","agent":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/agent/10027","date":"2020-09-16T19:23:36.451Z","role":"Publisher"}],"curationReasonDescription":"","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ff19a86d-404a-464e-8da6-8824ce45ed20_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/ff19a86d-404a-464e-8da6-8824ce45ed20_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/27a6719f-d00d-46d8-bfa6-7e482c5a908a","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Limited phenotype overlap described but abnormal gait, decreased grip strength suggestive of  mitochondrial disease","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/bd69e1f5-f451-4a3d-8d6e-36c69e37030e","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Some overlap of phenotypes which may be relevant to Leigh syndrome such as neurological abnormalities abnormal gait, decreased grip strength.","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31127358","rdfs:label":"IMPC KO mouse  International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"}}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/774b75e3-ae17-4cee-bbe9-96cd47bc3f56","type":"EvidenceLine","dc:description":"Transfection of wildtype ATP5MD cDNA rescued the formation of the dimeric supercomplex (Vd) and ATP production in patient fibroblast cells.","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"https://genegraph.clinicalgenome.org/r/e6bfbcde-2ca9-4eea-9b2c-7a2edab88690","type":"Finding","dc:description":"Rescue of dimerization and ATP production in patient fibroblast cells:\nFig3. transfection of wildtype USMG5  rescued the presence of the Vd complex, as shown by native gel analysis (Fig 3b/c) and showed recovery of ATP production with substrates for Complex I and II.
