For each of the internally generated antibodies, the exact antigen sequence is presented, together with a visualization of application-specific validation data, including a protein array assay, western blot analysis, immunohistochemistry and, in most cases, immunofluorescent-based confocal microscopy.

The octameric TCR-CD3 complex is assembled with 1:1:1:1 stoichiometry of TCRαβ:CD3γε:CD3δε:CD3ζζ. Assembly of the extracellular domains of TCR-CD3 is mediated by the constant domains and connecting peptides of TCRαβ that pack against CD3γε-CD3δε, forming a trimer-like structure proximal to the plasma membrane. The transmembrane segment of the CD3 complex adopts a barrel-like structure formed by interaction of the two transmembrane helices of CD3ζζ with those of CD3γε and CD3δε. Insertion of the transmembrane helices of TCRαβ into the barrel-like structure via both hydrophobic and ionic interactions results in transmembrane assembly of the TCR-CD3 complex.

CD3-zeta and CD3-eta result from the alternative splicing of a single gene designated CD3-zeta/eta. To evaluate the role of these subunits during T cell development, we have produced mice with a disrupted CD3-zeta/eta gene. The analysis of thymocyte populations from the CD3-zeta/eta-/- homozygous mutant mice revealed that they have a profound reduction in the surface levels of TCR complexes and that the products of the CD3-zeta/eta gene appear to be needed for the efficient generation and/or survival of CD4+CD8+ thymocytes. Despite the almost total absence of mature single positive thymocytes, the lymph nodes from zeta/eta-/- mice were found to contain unusual CD4+CD8- and CD4-CD8+ single positive cells which were CD3-. In contrast to the situation observed in the thymus, the thymus-independent gut intraepithelial lymphocytes present in zeta/eta-/- mice do express TCR complexes on their surface and these are associated with Fc epsilon RI gamma homodimers. These results establish an essential role for the CD3-zeta/eta gene products during intrathymic T cell differentiation and further emphasize the difference between conventional T cells and thymus-independent gut intraepithelial lymphocytes.","dc:creator":"Malissen M","dc:date":"1993","dc:title":"T cell development in mice lacking the CD3-zeta/eta gene."},"rdfs:label":"Malissen mouse model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:b6cd47df-b997-4243-bb31-f3fd5be56e80","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ae3089b6-3bd7-4a85-b166-d43148fad044","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Homozygous mice had considerably reduced T cells in spleen, lymph nodes, and blood.

We have established mice selectively lacking CD3 zeta but able to express CD3 eta, a polypeptide produced from the same locus through alternative splicing, using the method of gene targeting in embryonic stem cells. In homozygous mutant mice, the numbers of thymocytes and peripheral T cells were greatly reduced and the expression levels of TCR on these cells were 5-fold lower than those on wild-type cells. By contrast, TCR gamma delta+ intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes were not obviously affected by the mutation. T cells from homozygous mutants exhibited an impaired proliferative response. These results imply that CD3 zeta has a critical role in the development and signal transduction of T cells in vivo.","dc:creator":"Ohno H","dc:date":"1993","dc:title":"Developmental and functional impairment of T cells in mice lacking CD3 zeta chains."},"rdfs:label":"Ohno Mouse Model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":6}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":4053,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria8","strengthScore":15,"subject":{"id":"cggv:7eac7f97-5922-44ac-bc81-b1537f9e97b0","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0012426","gene":"hgnc:1677","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"CD247 was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive immunodeficiency 25 in 2006 (Rieux-Laucat et al., PMID: 16672702). Immunodeficiency 25 is a T-B+NK+ severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). Three variants (nonsense, initiator codon, and extension) that have been reported in 3 probands in 3 publications (PMIDs: 16672702, 27555457, 17170122) are included in this curation. Affected individuals typically present in infancy with severe, recurrent infections; low T cell counts; and impaired T cell proliferation. The production of autoantibodies has been described (PMID: 16672702); however, evidence for symptomatic autoimmunity is currently lacking. Multiple probands have been identified with somatic reversion in which spontaneously arising somatic mutations recover protein expression (PMID: 16672702, 27555457). Heterozygous carriers are reported as unaffected (PMID: 27555457). The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss of function.\n\nThis gene-disease association is supported by expression studies, protein interactions, functional assays, and animal models (PMIDs: 18853439, 31461748, 1717999, 27555457, 8223444, 8223445). CD247 is expressed in lymphoid tissues and encodes the zeta chain of the T-cell receptor (TCR) complex (PMID: 18853439). The TCR is made up of multiple other CD3 chains including gamma (CD3G gene) and epsilon (CD3E gene) (PMID: 31461748). Extracellular stimulation of the TCR phosphorylates the intracellular zeta chain, and the phosphorylated zeta chain binds a zeta chain associated protein kinase 70 (ZAP70 gene) to initiate downstream signaling (PMID: 1717999). We have previously established that these three genes; CD3E, CD3G, and ZAP70; are definitively associated with severe combined immunodeficiency. Impaired TCR-induced signaling including impaired ZAP70 phosphorylation has also been observed in human T cells that have a CD247 homozygous loss of function variant (PMID: 27555457). CD247 knockout mice have T cell lymphocytopenia and reduced T cell proliferation consistent with SCID (PMID: 8223444, 8223445).\n\nIn summary, CD247 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive immunodeficiency 25. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen SCID/CID GCEP on February 17, 2022 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:438b6c1f-edc0-4a81-9c82-39627e5a69cd"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
