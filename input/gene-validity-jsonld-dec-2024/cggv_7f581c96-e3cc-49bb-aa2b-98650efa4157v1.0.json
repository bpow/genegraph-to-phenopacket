One such disease is Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON), a neurodegenerative disease of young adults that results in blindness due to atrophy of the optic nerve. The etiology of LHON is genetically heterogeneous and in some cases multifactorial. Eleven mtDNA mutations have been associated with LHON, all of which are missense mutations in the subunit genes for the subunits of the electron transport chain complexes I, III, and IV. Molecular, biochemical, and population genetic studies have categorized these mutations as high risk (class I), low risk (class II), or intermediate risk (class I/II). Class I mutations appear to be primary genetic causes of LHON, while class II mutations are frequently found associated with class I genotypes and may serve as exacerbating genetic factors. Different LHON pedigrees can harbor different combinations of class I, II, or I/II mtDNA mutations, as shown by the complete sequence analysis of the mtDNAs of four LHON probands. The various mtDNA genotypes included an isolated class I mutation, combined class I+II mutations, and combined class I/II+II mutations. The occurrence of such genotypes supports the hypothesis that LHON may result from the additive effects of various genetic and environmental insults to OXPHOS, each of which increases the probability of blindness.","dc:creator":"Brown MD","dc:date":"1992","dc:title":"Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy: a model for mitochondrial neurodegenerative diseases."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7f581c96-e3cc-49bb-aa2b-98650efa4157_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12},{"id":"cggv:7f581c96-e3cc-49bb-aa2b-98650efa4157_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7f581c96-e3cc-49bb-aa2b-98650efa4157_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ba73e9d8-8f82-4473-974a-01e2c5aa109a","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6f5b2b57-f08b-4756-9199-3b777b9022ba","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"obo:MI_0915"},"dc:description":"Complex I","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27509854","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase), one of the largest membrane-bound enzymes in the cell, powers ATP synthesis in mammalian mitochondria by using the reducing potential of NADH to drive protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane. Mammalian complex I (ref. 1) contains 45 subunits, comprising 14 core subunits that house the catalytic machinery (and are conserved from bacteria to humans) and a mammalian-specific cohort of 31 supernumerary subunits. Knowledge of the structures and functions of the supernumerary subunits is fragmentary. Here we describe a 4.2-Å resolution single-particle electron cryomicroscopy structure of complex I from Bos taurus. We have located and modelled all 45 subunits, including the 31 supernumerary subunits, to provide the entire structure of the mammalian complex. Computational sorting of the particles identified different structural classes, related by subtle domain movements, which reveal conformationally dynamic regions and match biochemical descriptions of the 'active-to-de-active' enzyme transition that occurs during hypoxia. Our structures therefore provide a foundation for understanding complex I assembly and the effects of mutations that cause clinically relevant complex I dysfunctions, give insights into the structural and functional roles of the supernumerary subunits and reveal new information on the mechanism and regulation of catalysis.","dc:creator":"Zhu J","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"Structure of mammalian respiratory complex I."},"rdfs:label":"Zhu_Complex I subunit"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":">10 genes associated with PMD"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:7f581c96-e3cc-49bb-aa2b-98650efa4157_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9ecdb45c-5c7b-449a-94dc-e7752e89cf1c","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7891cf74-cc02-4340-8138-0e7af1b7ac08","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Cybrid cell lines were isolated from six independent control fusions and five independent patient fusions.

Defects of this protein lead to complex I deficiency. \n\n*MT-ND6* was first reported in relation to primary mitochondrial disease in 1992 (PMID: 1634041). While various names have been given to the constellation of features seen in those with *MT-ND6*-related disease, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *MT-ND6* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework. Of note, *MT-ND6* was previously curated by this panel for its association with Leigh syndrome spectrum (LSS) on May 17, 2021 (SOP v8), with a final classification of definitive. This current curation for the association with primary mitochondrial disease includes cases with LSS.\n\nEvidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included six variants (m.14439G>A, m.14459G>A, m.14484T>C, m.14487T>C, m.14495A>G, m.14600G>A) in 21 probands from 16 publications (PMIDs: 15576045, 20019223, 21196529, 10894222, 14684687, 17535832, 19103152, 21749722, 23813926, 25356405, 14595656, 19062322, 11133798,  30741831, 21364701, 2018041). All curated variants were missense, and m.14484T>C and m.14487T>C are recurrent variants. Cybrid studies further supported the pathogenicity of several variants (PMIDs: 17535832, 25356405, 14595656). Affected individuals present with a broad phenotypic spectrum of disease including Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON), mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS), and LSS phenotypes, as well as migraines, tremor, multiple sclerosis, and cardiac involvement. The age of onset is also highly variable, ranging from infantile to adult. Muscle biopsies revealed isolated complex I deficiency, and complex I and III deficiencies; and complex I deficiency was also seen in fibroblasts and liver. Metabolic screening labs showed elevated lactate and pyruvate in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood. Heteroplasmy levels in affected individuals ranged from 50% to >95% in skeletal muscle; 25% to >95% in blood, 76% to >95% in fibroblasts, and 65% to >95% in liver; and ranged in healthy family members from undetectable to 92% in blood, undetectable to 95% in urine, 14% to 95% in hair follicles, 16% to 68% in buccal, and was undetectable in muscle in healthy family members.\n\nLoss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease association is further supported by a known biochemical function shared with other genes associated with primary mitochondrial disease, functional alteration studies in patient derived cybrid cell lines (PMIDs: 27509854, 8622678), and a mouse model that recapitulates aspects of the primary mitochondrial disease phenotype (PMIDs: 23129651, 33536343). \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support this gene-disease relationship, including that more than three years have elapsed from the first proposal of the association. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on May 3, 2023 (SOP Version 9).
