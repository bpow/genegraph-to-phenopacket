A few mutations in POGZ have been reported in recent exome studies; however, these studies do not provide detailed clinical information. We collected the clinical and molecular data of 25 individuals with disruptive mutations in POGZ by diagnostic whole-exome, whole-genome, or targeted sequencing of 5,223 individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders (ID primarily) or by targeted resequencing of this locus in 12,041 individuals with ASD and/or ID. The rarity of disruptive mutations among unaffected individuals (2/49,401) highlights the significance (p = 4.19 × 10(-13); odds ratio = 35.8) and penetrance (65.9%) of this genetic subtype with respect to ASD and ID. By studying the entire cohort, we defined common phenotypic features of POGZ individuals, including variable levels of developmental delay (DD) and more severe speech and language delay in comparison to the severity of motor delay and coordination issues. We also identified significant associations with vision problems, microcephaly, hyperactivity, a tendency to obesity, and feeding difficulties. Some features might be explained by the high expression of POGZ, particularly in the cerebellum and pituitary, early in fetal brain development. We conducted parallel studies in Drosophila by inducing conditional knockdown of the POGZ ortholog row, further confirming that dosage of POGZ, specifically in neurons, is essential for normal learning in a habituation paradigm. Combined, the data underscore the pathogenicity of loss-of-function mutations in POGZ and define a POGZ-related phenotype enriched in specific features.","dc:creator":"Stessman HAF","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"Disruption of POGZ Is Associated with Intellectual Disability and Autism Spectrum Disorders."},"rdfs:label":"Disruption of POGZ Associated with ID and ASDs"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Many of the characteristic White-Sutton syndrome features were absent in this model (only learning difficulties was observed in this animal model).

Few data, however, are available on electroclinical features of POGZ-related epilepsy. We report a 5-year-old girl with a de novo inactivating POGZ mutation with a complex neurological phenotype characterized by hypotonia, severe developmental delay, and paroxysmal epileptic and nonepileptic events. Comparing this patient with the previously reported nine cases exhibiting epilepsy as associated feature, we detected that epilepsy onset is mostly during infancy (1-4 years of age), with both focal and generalized seizures. EEGs reveal that epileptic abnormalities mainly are localized in the frontal regions, and seizure control might be reached with one or multiple antiepileptic drugs. Besides dysmorphic features and other comorbidities (microcephaly, intellectual disability, absent speech, sensorineural hearing loss, and autistic spectrum disorder) major brain MR features include cortical and cerebellar atrophy, delayed myelination, and brainstem hypoplasia.

Recent tremendous advances in the whole exome sequencing (WES) enable rapid identification of variants associated with ASD including single nucleotide variations (SNVs) and indels. To further explore genetic etiology of ASD in Chinese children with negative findings of copy number variants (CNVs), we applied WES in 80 simplex families with a single affected offspring with ASD or suspected ASD, and validated variations predicted to be damaging by Sanger sequencing. The results showed that an overall diagnostic yield of 8.8% (9.2% in the group of ASD and 6.7% in the group of suspected ASD) was observed in our cohort. Among patients with diagnosed ASD, developmental delay or intellectual disability (DD/ID) was the most common comorbidity with a diagnostic yield of 13.3%, followed by seizures (50.0%) and craniofacial anomalies (40.0%). All of identified de novo SNVs and indels among patients with ASD were loss of function (LOF) variations and were slightly more frequent among female (male vs. female: 7.3% vs. 8.5%). A total of seven presumed causative genes (CHD8, AFF2, ADNP, POGZ, SHANK3, IL1RAPL1, and PTEN) were identified in this study.

At this time, 59 pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants have been reported in humans, with all but one less than 51bp. \n\nVariants in this gene have been reported in a number of individual probands since 2016. Most are predicted LOF, as duplications, deletions, or frameshift variants lead to a premature stop codon. All are de novo, or assumed de novo (where DNA from one parent may not be available). With the expanding phenotypic spectrum (for example, as explored in Batzir et al., PMID: 31782611), it is highly likely that more cases of White-Sutton syndrome, caused by pathogenic variants in POGZ, will be reported, maintaining the definitive status of this gene-disease association.\n\nNon-human model organisms have been used to investigate the effect of POGZ LOF on brain function, and behaviours related to White-Sutton syndrome. In this curation, two such examples are presented: first, a Drosophila model from Stessman et al. (PMID: 26942287), and second, a KO mouse model from Suliman et al. (2018). Both supported an important role for POGZ in neuronal functioning, with an adverse behavioural phenotype presenting with POGZ LOF. Note that there was no PMID that could be found associated with the Suliman et al. paper (doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/437442). Based on the evidence presented in this paper, the default points for a non-human model organism (2 points) were awarded.  \n\nIn summary, at present there is an abundance of evidence to support a definitive classification for this gene-disease relationship. Future recurations will likely continue to support this recently described syndromic condition.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:c5742d94-0642-4598-9fbd-fd43a2c21559"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
