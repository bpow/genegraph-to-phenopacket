They represent plasma membrane domains enriched in specific transmembrane glycoproteins, notably desmoglein (Dsg) and desmocollin (Dsc), both of which have recently been identified as members of the larger family of Ca(2+)-dependent cell adhesion molecules, the cadherins. Previously described forms of desmoglein have been isolated as proteins and cloned as cDNAs from epidermis and related stratified epithelia but have not been detected in the majority of other desmosome-containing tissues and cell culture lines. Here we present the complete cDNA-derived amino acid (aa) sequence of a different desmoglein polypeptide, termed Dsg2 (1069 aa, mol wt 116,760) and its precursor molecule (1117 aa, mol wt 122,384), which occurs in all human and bovine desmosome-producing tissues, tumors, and cell lines examined, epithelial as well as nonepithelial ones. We conclude that Dsg2, the largest molecule in this protein family, is the fundamental desmoglein common to all desmosome-possessing tissues, including simple epithelia and myocardium, and many cell cultures. Furthermore, in several tissues and cell lines Dsg2 is the only Dsg isoform detected so far. By contrast, the epidermal isoforms Dsg1 and Dsg3 are restricted to certain specialized epithelia, mostly stratified squamous ones. The importance of the junction-specific cadherin Dsg2 in tissue formation and carcinogenesis as well as in the development of autoimmune diseases of the Pemphigus type is discussed. In addition, we propose to use Dsg2 as a general marker common to all epithelial cells and tumors and to use the specific pattern of occurrence of Dsg and Dsc isoforms as an additional criterion for cell typing in tumor diagnosis.","dc:creator":"Schäfer S","dc:date":"1994","dc:title":"Identification of the ubiquitous human desmoglein, Dsg2, and the expression catalogue of the desmoglein subfamily of desmosomal cadherins."},"rdfs:label":"Myocardium Expression"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:42e25688-75bc-4fd3-95f1-5c44dcf56080","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:32e00fa0-66e0-4f7a-82d3-be6ead83ac5b","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"obo:MI_0915"},"dc:description":"DSG2 co-immunoprecipitates with PKP2 in co-transfected COS cells.

Among the three known plakophilin members, plakophilin 1 has been linked to a genetic skin disorder and shown to play important roles in desmosome assembly and organization. However, little is known about the binding partners and functions of the most widely expressed member, plakophilin 2. To better understand the cellular functions of plakophilin 2, we have examined its protein interactions with other junctional molecules using co-immunoprecipitation and yeast two-hybrid assays. Here we show that plakophilin 2 can interact directly with several desmosomal components, including desmoplakin, plakoglobin, desmoglein 1 and 2, and desmocollin 1a and 2a. The head domain of plakophilin 2 is critical for most of these interactions and is sufficient to direct plakophilin 2 to cell borders. In addition, plakophilin 2 is less efficient than plakophilin 1 in localizing to the nucleus and enhancing the recruitment of excess desmoplakin to cell borders in transiently transfected COS cells. Furthermore, plakophilin 2 is able to associate with beta-catenin through its head domain, and the expression of plakophilin 2 in SW480 cells up-regulates the endogenous beta-catenin/T cell factor-signaling activity. This up-regulation by plakophilin 2 is abolished by ectopic expression of E-cadherin, suggesting that these proteins compete for the same pool of signaling active beta-catenin. Our results demonstrate that plakophilin 2 interacts with a broader repertoire of desmosomal components than plakophilin 1 and provide new insight into the possible roles of plakophilin 2 in regulating the signaling activity of beta-catenin.","dc:creator":"Chen X","dc:date":"2002","dc:title":"Protein binding and functional characterization of plakophilin 2.

This study aimed to investigate how DSG2 mutations contribute to the pathogenesis of ARVC.

In addition, three recognized DSG2 mutations were identified in 12 families. These results and further mutation analyses of four additional desmosomal genes indicated that ARVC caused by DSG2 mutations is often transmitted by recessive or digenic inheritance. Because desmosomal proteins are also expressed in skin tissue, keratinocytes served as a cell model to investigate DSG2 protein expression by Western blotting, 2D-PAGE, and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The results showed that heterozygous mutation carriers expressed both mutated and wild-type DSG2 proteins.

Variants in DSG2 were first reported in humans with this disease as early as 2006 (Pilchou et al., PMID: 16505173). Variation in DSG2 is a well-known cause of ARVC and accounts for 5%-26% of cases (McNAlly et al., 2005; PMID: 20301310). Since this gene-disease relationship is well-known, there is a significant amount of case-level data, segregation data and experimental data available in the literature, therefore the maximum score for both genetic evidence and experimental evidence has been reached.  Note, this curation effort may not be exhaustive of all literature related to this gene-disease relationship. This gene-disease relationship is supported by animal models, in vitro assays, expression assays, and protein interactions. In summary, DSG2 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant ARVC. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Arrythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy Gene Curation Expert Panel on September 14, 2018 (SOP Version 6).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:f679611d-6e25-45f9-aac3-4a8ad37b1592"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
