Structural brain defects, with or without mental retardation, are additional features of several CMD syndromes. Approximately 40% of patients with CMD have a primary deficiency (MDC1A) of the laminin alpha2 chain of merosin (laminin-2) due to mutations in the LAMA2 gene. In addition, a secondary deficiency of laminin alpha2 is apparent in some CMD syndromes, including MDC1B, which is mapped to chromosome 1q42, and both muscle-eye-brain disease (MEB) and Fukuyama CMD (FCMD), two forms with severe brain involvement. The FCMD gene encodes a protein of unknown function, fukutin, though sequence analysis predicts it to be a phosphoryl-ligand transferase. Here we identify the gene for a new member of the fukutin protein family (fukutin related protein [FKRP]), mapping to human chromosome 19q13.3. We report the genomic organization of the FKRP gene and its pattern of tissue expression. Mutations in the FKRP gene have been identified in seven families with CMD characterized by disease onset in the first weeks of life and a severe phenotype with inability to walk, muscle hypertrophy, marked elevation of serum creatine kinase, and normal brain structure and function. Affected individuals had a secondary deficiency of laminin alpha2 expression. In addition, they had both a marked decrease in immunostaining of muscle alpha-dystroglycan and a reduction in its molecular weight on western blot analysis. We suggest these abnormalities of alpha-dystroglycan are caused by its defective glycosylation and are integral to the pathology seen in MDC1C.","dc:creator":"Brockington M","dc:date":"2001","dc:title":"Mutations in the fukutin-related protein gene (FKRP) cause a form of congenital muscular dystrophy with secondary laminin alpha2 deficiency and abnormal glycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan."}},{"id":"cggv:f45ed215-b752-4cbc-a5e9-9c8d7dfbf701_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:90f36a53-987d-4ac8-a6a5-ec46399939af"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11592034"}],"rdfs:label":"BR1P"},{"id":"cggv:f45ed215-b752-4cbc-a5e9-9c8d7dfbf701","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f45ed215-b752-4cbc-a5e9-9c8d7dfbf701_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"Ample phenotypic evidence combined with a termination variant provides default points."},{"id":"cggv:a8cef22e-d19f-4ac7-b185-26e7add551bf","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a8cef22e-d19f-4ac7-b185-26e7add551bf_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1,"dc:description":"Ample phenotypic evidence combined with a termination variant provides default points."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:3b62604b-7b30-4649-8561-2ba8d8c31e24_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3b62604b-7b30-4649-8561-2ba8d8c31e24","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Days","allele":[{"id":"cggv:537a81fb-c752-4cc0-bf40-6f4f6d9e2faf","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_024301.5(FKRP):c.1201G>A (p.Asp401Asn)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/551029"}},{"id":"cggv:f299a62c-fb01-49d4-812c-d16e8271d1dc","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_024301.5(FKRP):c.341C>G (p.Ala114Gly)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA149248"}}],"detectionMethod":"Linkage to FKRP assessed via markers D19S219 and D19S606.

The onset of symptoms in CMD is within the first few months of life, whereas in LGMD they can occur in late childhood, adolescence or adult life. We have recently demonstrated that the fukutin-related protein gene (FKRP) is mutated in a severe form of CMD (MDC1C), characterized by the inability to walk, leg muscle hypertrophy and a secondary deficiency of laminin alpha2 and alpha-dystroglycan. Both MDC1C and LGMD2I map to an identical region on chromosome 19q13.3. To investigate whether these are allelic disorders, we undertook mutation analysis of FKRP in 25 potential LGMD2I families, including some with a severe and early onset phenotype. Mutations were identified in individuals from 17 families. A variable reduction of alpha-dystroglycan expression was observed in the skeletal muscle biopsy of all individuals studied. In addition, several cases showed a deficiency of laminin alpha2 either by immunocytochemistry or western blotting. Unexpectedly, affected individuals from 15 families had an identical C826A (Leu276Ileu) mutation, including five that were homozygous for this change. Linkage analysis identified at least two possible haplotypes in linkage disequilibrium with this mutation. Patients with the C826A change had the clinically less severe LGMD2I phenotype, suggesting that this is a less disruptive FKRP mutation than those found in MDC1C. The spectrum of LGMD2I phenotypes ranged from infants with an early presentation and a Duchenne-like disease course including cardiomyopathy, to milder phenotypes compatible with a favourable long-term outcome.","dc:creator":"Brockington M","dc:date":"2001","dc:title":"Mutations in the fukutin-related protein gene (FKRP) identify limb girdle muscular dystrophy 2I as a milder allelic variant of congenital muscular dystrophy MDC1C."}},"rdfs:label":"BRO1P"},{"id":"cggv:251c8ffe-2671-4b9d-a663-447f6ea67338","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:251c8ffe-2671-4b9d-a663-447f6ea67338_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:eab5a0ee-74cc-4cda-a1f3-4039a945b248_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:eab5a0ee-74cc-4cda-a1f3-4039a945b248","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Days","allele":{"id":"cggv:5e5b35a2-e383-41d2-9b5c-82f59c6dde27","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_024301.5(FKRP):c.649C>A (p.Pro217Thr)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA406495733"}},"detectionMethod":"Linkage to FKRP assessed via markers D19S219 and D19S606.

In the early 2000s, a new classification of muscular dystrophy, dystroglycanopathy, was established. Dystroglycanopathy often associates with abnormalities in the central nervous system. Currently, at least eighteen genes have been identified that are responsible for dystroglycanopathy, and despite its genetic heterogeneity, its common biochemical feature is abnormal glycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan. Abnormal glycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan reduces its binding activities to ligand proteins, including laminins. In just the last few years, remarkable progress has been made in determining the sugar chain structures and gene functions associated with dystroglycanopathy. The normal sugar chain contains tandem structures of ribitol-phosphate, a pentose alcohol that was previously unknown in humans. The dystroglycanopathy genes fukutin, fukutin-related protein (FKRP), and isoprenoid synthase domain-containing protein (ISPD) encode essential enzymes for the synthesis of this structure: fukutin and FKRP transfer ribitol-phosphate onto sugar chains of alpha-dystroglycan, and ISPD synthesizes CDP-ribitol, a donor substrate for fukutin and FKRP. These findings resolved long-standing questions and established a disease subgroup that is ribitol-phosphate deficient, which describes a large population of dystroglycanopathy patients. Here, we review the history of dystroglycanopathy, the properties of the sugar chain structure of alpha-dystroglycan, dystroglycanopathy gene functions, and therapeutic strategies.","dc:creator":"Kanagawa M","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Muscular Dystrophy with Ribitol-Phosphate Deficiency: A Novel Post-Translational Mechanism in Dystroglycanopathy."},"rdfs:label":"FKRP and α-DG Glycosylation"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"FKRP's biochemical function is both very well-known and shared with a group of many other genes that share similar phenotypes due to identical molecular mechanisms.

The clinical variations associated with FKRP mutations range from mild limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2I with predominantly muscle phenotypes to severe Walker-Warburg syndrome and muscle-eye-brain disease with striking structural brain and eye defects. In the present study, we have generated animal models and demonstrated that ablation of FKRP functions is embryonic lethal and that the homozygous-null embryos die before reaching E12.5. The homozygous knock-in mouse carrying the missense P448L mutation almost completely lacks functional glycosylation of α-DG in muscles and brain, validating the essential role of FKRP in the functional glycosylation of α-DG. However, the knock-in mouse survives and develops a wide range of structural abnormalities in the central nervous system, characteristics of neuronal migration defects. The brain and eye defects are highly reminiscent of the phenotypes seen in severe dystroglycanopathy patients. In addition, skeletal muscles develop progressive muscular dystrophy. Our results confirm that post-translational modifications of α-DG are essential for normal development of the brain and eyes. In addition, both the mutation itself and the levels of FKRP expression are equally critical for the survival of the animals. The exceptionally wide clinical spectrums recapitulated in the P448L mice also suggest the involvement of other factors in the disease progression. The mutant mouse represents a valuable model to further elucidate the functions of FKRP and develop therapies for FKRP-related muscular dystrophies.","dc:creator":"Chan YM","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"Fukutin-related protein is essential for mouse muscle, brain and eye development and mutation recapitulates the wide clinical spectrums of dystroglycanopathies."},"rdfs:label":"FKRP P448L Mice & MDD"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"Although this knock-in model does perfectly recapitulate many of the phenotypes observed in more severe variants of MDD in humans, the presence of the neomycin casette has some impact on the severity as without it the mice show few abnormalities.

However, there is clear evidence of decreased alpha-dystroglycan glycosylation in all ages of the L276I mice which increases in severity based on age.

We created a mouse model of the common FKRP L276I mutation and a hemizygous FKRP L276I knockout model. We studied histopathology and protein expression in the models at different ages and found that homozygous FKRP L276I mice developed a mild progressive myopathy with increased muscle regeneration and fibrosis starting from 1 year of age. This was likely caused by progressive loss of α-dystroglycan-specific glycosylation, which was decreased by 78% at 20 months. The homozygous FKRP knockout was embryonic lethal, but the hemizygous L276I model resembled the homozygous FKRP L276I model at comparable ages. These models emphasize the importance of FKRP in maintaining proper glycosylation of α-dystroglycan. The mild progression in the homozygous FKRP L276I model resembles that in patients with LGMD2I who are homozygous for the L276I mutation. This animal model could, therefore, be relevant for understanding the pathophysiology of and developing a treatment strategy for the human disorder.

At least 100 unique variants (e.g. missense, in-frame indel, nonsense, frameshift, etc.) have been reported in humans according to ClinVar and HGMD with various historical diagnoses such as Muscle-Eye-Brain Disease, Walker-Warburg Syndrome, and LGMDR9 (LGMD2I). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data.\n\nVariants in this gene have been reported in at least 14 probands in 3 publications (PMIDs: 11592034, 11741828, 15121789). Many more probands are reported in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts) has been reached. Variants are associated with a variety of phenotypes including both congenital muscle-eye-brain or WWS or later-onset LGMD based on the residual α-Dystroglycan glycosylation activity, with higher activity correlating to a less severe presentation. The mechanism for disease is biallelic loss of function, with variants causing reduced glycosylation activity and a resulting lack of functional α-Dystroglycan. As this is an essential component in the complex responsible for stabilizing skeletal or cardiac muscle, as well as brain/eye functionality, the resulting disruption causes the presenting phenotypes such as muscle weakness, cardiac and respiratory involvement, and brain/eye abnormalities.\n\nThis gene-disease association is supported by many years of experimental evidence. This includes its well-known function in the O-mannosylation of α-Dystroglycan, as well as the formation of a complex with other proteins implicated in muscular dystrophy dystroglycanopathy such as FKTN and TMEM5 and the oligomerization/activity of *FKRP* mutants being significantly less than the WT protein. There are several well-supported mouse models as well, with knock-in models of both L276I and P448L showing dystrophic features (PMIDs: 20675713, 26574668).\n\nIn summary,*FKRP* is definitively associated with myopathy caused by variation in *FKRP*. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:6cb46400-ca4b-48cd-aaf7-dd493f0d2971"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
