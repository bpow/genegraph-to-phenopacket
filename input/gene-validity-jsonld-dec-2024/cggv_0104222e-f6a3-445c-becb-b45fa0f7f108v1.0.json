Deficient biosynthesis of COG subunits leads to alterations of protein trafficking along the secretory pathway and thereby to severe diseases in humans. Since the COG complex affects the localization of several Golgi glycosyltransferase enzymes, COG deficiency also leads to defective protein glycosylation, thereby explaining the classification of COG deficiencies as forms of congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG). To date, mutations in COG1, COG4, COG7 and COG8 genes have been associated with diseases, which range from severe multi-organ disorders to moderate forms of neurological impairment. In the present study, we describe a new type of COG deficiency related to a splicing mutation in the COG5 gene. Sequence analysis in the patient identified a homozygous intronic substitution (c.1669-15T>C) leading to exon skipping and severely reduced expression of the COG5 protein. This defect was associated with a mild psychomotor retardation with delayed motor and language development. Analysis of different serum glycoproteins revealed a CDG phenotype with typical undersialylation of N- and O-glycans. Retrograde Golgi-to-endoplasmic reticulum trafficking was markedly delayed in the patient's fibroblast upon brefeldin-A treatment, which is a hallmark of COG deficiency. This trafficking delay could be restored to normal values by expressing a wild-type COG5 cDNA in the patient cells. This case demonstrates that COG deficiency and thereby CDG must be taken into consideration even in children presenting mild neurological impairments.","dc:creator":"Paesold-Burda P","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"Deficiency in COG5 causes a moderate form of congenital disorders of glycosylation."}},"rdfs:label":"Patient (Paesold-Burda P et al, 2009)"},{"id":"cggv:fc9c0136-6f22-4ebc-8826-fbb9cfb63894","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:fc9c0136-6f22-4ebc-8826-fbb9cfb63894_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:fc9c0136-6f22-4ebc-8826-fbb9cfb63894_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Low levels of full-length COG5 protein in patient fibroblasts (by western blot) confirmed the disease-causing effect of the splicing mutation.

The results demonstrated that all examined COG proteins (Cog1, Cog2, Cog3, and Cog5) co-precipitated together. Similarly, using an antibody against Cog1 in a sample from bovine brain cells yielded the same outcome. Furthermore, the researchers confirmed that Sec8, a protein from a different complex, did not co-precipitate with the COG proteins.

Three complexes that have previously been partially characterized include (a) the Golgi transport complex (GTC), identified in an in vitro membrane transport assay, (b) the ldlCp complex, identified in analyses of CHO cell mutants with defects in Golgi-associated glycosylation reactions, and (c) the mammalian Sec34 complex, identified by homology to yeast Sec34p, implicated in vesicular transport. We show that these three complexes are identical and rename them the conserved oligomeric Golgi (COG) complex. The COG complex comprises four previously characterized proteins (Cog1/ldlBp, Cog2/ldlCp, Cog3/Sec34, and Cog5/GTC-90), three homologues of yeast Sec34/35 complex subunits (Cog4, -6, and -8), and a previously unidentified Golgi-associated protein (Cog7). EM of ldlB and ldlC mutants established that COG is required for normal Golgi morphology. \"Deep etch\" EM of purified COG revealed an approximately 37-nm-long structure comprised of two similarly sized globular domains connected by smaller extensions.

To date, 13 COG5 mutations have been reported in relation to 10 cases (Wang et al., PMID:32174980). Common symptoms among the reported cases include neurological, morphological, and hepatic abnormalities. Defects in the COG5 protein are mainly associated with abnormalities of the brain, liver, bladder, and auditory and visual systems (Yin et al., PMID:31572517). Most of the COG5 mutations are located in exons, while one mutation is a homozygous intronic substitution that leads to COG5 exon skipping. Due to the COG5 protein being highly conserved among numerous species, the full-length protein is important for its function (Yin et al., PMID:31572517). \nMore evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12pts) has been reached. The gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence in the form of biochemical function in COG5 proteins (Wang et al., PMID:32174980) and Brefeldin A (BFA) treatment (Praesold-Burda et al., PMID:19690088). Additional experimental evidence highlights interactions between COG5 and other COG proteins (Ungar et al., PMID:11980916). \nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between COG5 and autosomal recessive congenital disorder of glycosylation (CDG). This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time.
