ZAP70 and Syk are expressed in all murine and human thymocyte subpopulations that were examined, ranging from the most immature CD4- CD8- stage to the mature single positive stage (Fig 4).

We have recently identified a 70-kDa protein tyrosine kinase, ZAP-70, which associates with the human TCR zeta-chain after TCR stimulation. We report here the isolation and sequence of a cDNA clone that encodes murine ZAP-70. Murine and human ZAP-70 share 93% amino acid identity and are homologous to the 72-kDa protein tyrosine kinase Syk. Syk has been implicated in the signal transduction pathways of the B cell membrane Ig and high affinity IgE receptors, Fc epsilon RI. In addition, we examined the tissue distribution of ZAP-70 and Syk in human and murine thymocyte subsets, B cells, and peripheral T cell subsets. ZAP-70 protein is expressed in all major thymocyte populations, with the level of expression being comparable to that found in both CD4+ and CD8+ peripheral T cells. Although Syk protein is also present in all thymocyte subsets, expression of Syk protein is down-regulated threefold to fourfold in peripheral T cells. In contrast to ZAP-70, expression of Syk is 12- to 15-fold higher in peripheral B cells when compared with peripheral T cells. In addition, whereas T cell stimulation results in down-regulation of Lck, no significant change in ZAP-70 or Syk protein is detected. Finally, we provide evidence that both ZAP-70 and Syk can associate with the TCR after TCR stimulation. With the use of a heterologous expression system, we show that, like ZAP-70, Syk is dependent upon a Src-family protein tyrosine kinase for association with the phosphorylated zeta-chain. Thus, the differential expression of these kinases suggests the possibility of different roles for ZAP-70 and Syk in TCR signaling and thymic development.","dc:creator":"Chan AC","dc:date":"1994","dc:title":"Differential expression of ZAP-70 and Syk protein tyrosine kinases, and the role of this family of protein tyrosine kinases in TCR signaling."},"rdfs:label":"Chan expression"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:84a386c6-2ee8-4e35-89a9-29b57065a40c","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f2ab1642-ddd8-4eb8-b804-73b96a4cf6aa","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"},"dc:description":"ZAP70 is recruited to phosphorylated TCR-CD3 complexes via its SH2\ndomains, is activated by Lck and trans-autophosphorylated and released from the TCR into the plane of the plasma membrane.

The signaling pathways required to transmit this survival signal are poorly understood. In this study, we asked whether the tyrosine kinase Zap70 is required to transmit survival signals in naive CD8 T cells. In the absence of Zap70 expression, thymic development is completely blocked. Using a tetracycline-inducible Zap70 transgene (TetZap70), thymic development of Zap70-deficient TCR transgenic F5 mice was restored. Feeding mice doxycycline to induce Zap70 expression resulted in repopulation of the peripheral naive compartment. Zap70 transgene expression was then ablated by withdrawal of doxycycline. Survival of Zap70-deficient naive CD8 T cells depended on host environment. In hosts with a replete T cell compartment, naive T cells died rapidly in the absence of Zap70 expression. In lymphopenic hosts, Zap70-deficient T cells survived far longer, in an IL-7-dependent manner, but failed to undergo lymphopenia-induced proliferation. Analyzing mixed bone marrow chimeras revealed that intact Zap70-dependent signaling was important for integration of recent thymic emigrants into the mature naive compartment. Finally, we asked whether adaptor function conferred by Zap70 tyrosines 315 and 319 was necessary for transmission of homeostatic TCR signals. This was done by analyzing F5 mice expressing mutant Zap70 in which these residues had been mutated to alanines (Zap70(YYAA)). Inducible Zap70 expression rescued thymic development in F5 TetZap70 Zap70(YYAA) mice. However, in the absence of wild-type Zap70 expression, the Zap70(YYAA) mutant failed to transmit either survival or proliferative homeostatic signals.

ZAP70 related combined immunodeficiency is caused by abnormal T-cell receptor signaling with low to absent CD8+ T cells and normal CD3+ and CD4+ T cells numbers. Symptoms include recurrent infections, including severe lower respiratory infections and oral candidiasis, chronic diarrhea, and failure to thrive. Combined immunodeficiencies such as ZAP-70 deficiency or major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and II gene expression deficiency may not be detected with the TREC assay as T-cell development is intact beyond the point of T-cell receptor (TCR) gene recombination (PMID: 32579701). Six variants (missense, nonsense, frameshift, and splicing substitutions) that have been reported in six probands in six publications (PMIDs: 8124727, 28124082, 21094993, 30778343, 8202713, 8202712) are included in this curation. Variants in this gene segregated with disease in two additional family members (PMIDs: 27448562). Heterozygous carriers in these families did not show evidence of pathogenicity.The mechanism of pathogenicity is known to be loss of function. This gene-disease association is also supported by animal models, expression studies, biochemical studies, and functional studies in patient cells (PMIDs: 27869819, 8176201, 25092893, 25092893, 8124727). ZAP70 is expressed exclusively in T and NK cell lines and is expressed in all murine and human thymocyte subpopulations (PMID: 8176201). ZAP70 null mice have no detectable ZAP70 expression and absent T cells and when null mice with a tetracycline inducible Zap70 transgene are induced with Zap70 protein, thymocyte generation is partially restored (PMID: 25092893). ZAP70 interacts with the T cell receptor complex via its SH2 domains and is activated by Lck (PMID: 27869819). In summary, ZAP70 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive combined immunodeficiency. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen SCID/CID GCEP on January 20, 2022 (SOP Version 8).
