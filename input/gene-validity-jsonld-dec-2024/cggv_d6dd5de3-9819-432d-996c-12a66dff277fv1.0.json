We studied two individuals with 2-aminoadipic and 2-oxoadipic aciduria, a metabolic condition that is still unresolved at the molecular level. This disorder has been associated with varying neurological symptoms. Exome sequencing of a single affected individual revealed compound heterozygosity for an initiating methionine mutation (c.1A>G) and a missense mutation (c.2185G>A [p.Gly729Arg]) in DHTKD1. This gene codes for dehydrogenase E1 and transketolase domain-containing protein 1, which is part of a 2-oxoglutarate-dehydrogenase-complex-like protein. Sequence analysis of a second individual identified the same missense mutation together with a nonsense mutation (c.1228C>T [p.Arg410(∗)]) in DHTKD1. Increased levels of 2-oxoadipate in individual-derived fibroblasts normalized upon lentiviral expression of the wild-type DHTKD1 mRNA. Moreover, investigation of L-lysine metabolism showed an accumulation of deuterium-labeled 2-oxoadipate only in noncomplemented cells, demonstrating that DHTKD1 codes for the enzyme mediating the last unresolved step in the L-lysine-degradation pathway.

GCDH deficiency leads to disruption of l-lysine degradation with characteristic accumulation of glutarylcarnitine and neurotoxic glutaric acid (GA), glutaryl-CoA, 3-hydroxyglutaric acid (3-OHGA). DHTKD1 acts upstream of GCDH, and its deficiency leads to none or often mild clinical phenotype in humans, 2-aminoadipic 2-oxoadipic aciduria. We hypothesized that inhibition of DHTKD1 may prevent the accumulation of neurotoxic dicarboxylic metabolites suggesting DHTKD1 inhibition as a possible treatment strategy for GA-I. In order to validate this hypothesis we took advantage of an existing GA-I (Gcdh-/-) mouse model and established a Dhtkd1 deficient mouse model. Both models reproduced the biochemical and clinical phenotype observed in patients. Under challenging conditions of a high lysine diet, only Gcdh-/- mice but not Dhtkd1-/- mice developed clinical symptoms such as lethargic behaviour and weight loss. However, the genetic Dhtkd1 inhibition in Dhtkd1-/-/Gcdh-/- mice could not rescue the GA-I phenotype. Biochemical results confirm this finding with double knockout mice showing similar metabolite accumulations as Gcdh-/- mice with high GA in brain and liver. This suggests that DHTKD1 inhibition alone is not sufficient to treat GA-I, but instead a more complex strategy is needed. Our data highlights the many unresolved questions within the l-lysine degradation pathway and provides evidence for a so far unknown mechanism leading to glutaryl-CoA.","dc:creator":"Biagosch C","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Elevated glutaric acid levels in Dhtkd1-/Gcdh- double knockout mice challenge our current understanding of lysine metabolism."},"rdfs:label":"DHTKD1 Exon 7 KO Mice Display Aciduria"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"Although this model shows no significant neurological or developmental difference when compared to wild-type mice, the association with DHTKD1 mutations to these developmental delay phenotypes are variable in humans.

A follow-up test found increased insulin levels and sensitivity likely due to the increased acid levels stimulating islets to create insulin. Abberant insulin signalling can be related to the pathogenesis of neuropathies such as Alzheimer's disease and peripheral neuropathies with severe myelin alterations, which may be related to developmental phenotypes observed in some probands. Notably, these mice also display signs of CMT2-like phenotypes with decreases in retention time in the rotarod test and running distance in the treadmill test compared to WT mice. No behavioral abnormalities were observed, which are seen somewhat inconsistently in 2-aminoadipic and 2-oxoadipic aciduriahuman probands.

Mutations in DHTKD1 block the metabolic pathway and cause 2-aminoadipic and 2-oxoadipic aciduria (AMOXAD), an autosomal recessive inborn metabolic disorder. In addition, a nonsense mutation in DHTKD1 that we identified previously causes Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) type 2Q, one of the most common inherited neurological disorders affecting the peripheral nerves in the musculature. However, the comprehensive molecular mechanism underlying CMT2Q remains elusive. Here, we show that Dhtkd1-/- mice mimic the major aspects of CMT2 phenotypes, characterized by progressive weakness and atrophy in the distal parts of limbs with motor and sensory dysfunctions, which are accompanied with decreased nerve conduction velocity. Moreover, DHTKD1 deficiency causes severe metabolic abnormalities and dramatically increased levels of 2-ketoadipic acid (2-KAA) and 2-aminoadipic acid (2-AAA) in urine. Further studies revealed that both 2-KAA and 2-AAA could stimulate insulin biosynthesis and secretion. Subsequently, elevated insulin regulates myelin protein zero (Mpz) transcription in Schwann cells via upregulating the expression of early growth response 2 (Egr2), leading to myelin structure damage and axonal degeneration. Finally, 2-AAA-fed mice do reproduce phenotypes similar to CMT2Q phenotypes. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that loss of DHTKD1 causes CMT2Q-like phenotypes through dysregulation of Mpz mRNA and protein zero (P0) which are closely associated with elevated DHTKD1 substrate and insulin levels.

DHTKD1 encodes a a thiamine diphosphate-dependent 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase which is part of the lysine degrative pathway specifically catalyzing the reaction of 2-oxoadipate to Glutaryl-CoA in the mitochondria. At least 13 variants (e.g. missense, in-frame indel, nonsense, frameshift, etc) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data.\nVariants in this gene have been reported in at least eleven probands in three publications (PMIDs: 26141459, 25860818, 23141293). Although many of the probands with variants in this gene display phenoypes other than the 2-aminoadipic 2-oxoadipic aciduria itself such as developmental delay, motor defecits, speech delay, or ADHD, the association of DHTKD1 with these phenotypes has not yet been experimentally confirmed and is therefore classified as a biochemical abnormality. The mechanism for disease is homozygous loss of function, with defecits in viable protein levels preventing the lysine degredation pathway from proceeding normally causing a buildup of metabolites in the tissues, blood, and urine. (Danhauser et al.) Of note, this gene has also been implicated in Autosomal Dominant Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease Type 2Q in a single family (Xu et al., PMID: 23141294). This assertion has been split and will be assessed separately.\nThis gene-disease association is supported by two animal models, a rescue in patient fibroblasts, in vitro functional assays, and the function of the protein. Two DHTKD1 KO mouse models, created via different methods, displayed significantly elevated 2-aminoadipic and 2-oxoadipic acid levels in tissues and urine. A rescue using wild-type DHTKD1 cDNA in patient fibroblasts was also performed which rescued the increased acid levels around the cells. Finally, investigation into DHTKD1's function displayed that it is essential for mitochondrial function, biogenesis, and energy metabolism and that knockdown can lead to impaired function.\nIn summary, DHTKD1 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive 2-aminoadipic 2-oxoadipic aciduria. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This clinical validity classification was approved by the ClinGen Aminoacidopathy Gene Curation Expert Panel on 02/27/2020.
