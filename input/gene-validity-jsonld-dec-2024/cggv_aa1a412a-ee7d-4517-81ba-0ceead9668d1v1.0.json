It is caused by haploinsufficiency of the NSD1 gene. In this study, our objective was to identify downstream effectors of NSD1 and to map these effectors in signaling pathways associated with growth. Genome-wide expression studies were performed on dermal fibroblasts from SoS patients with a confirmed NSD1 abnormality. To substantiate those results, phosphorylation, siRNA and transfection experiments were performed. A significant association was demonstrated with the Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) pathway. Members of the fibroblast growth factor family such as FGF4 and FGF13 contributed strongly to the differential expression in this pathway. In addition, a diminished activity state of the MAPK/ERK pathway was demonstrated in SoS. The Ras Interacting Protein 1 (RASIP1) was identified to exhibit upregulated expression in SoS. It was shown that RASIP1 dose-dependently potentiated bFGF induced expression of the MAPK responsive SBE reporter providing further support for a link between NSD1 and the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway. Additionally, we demonstrated NSD1 expression in the terminally differentiated hypertrophic chondrocytes of normal human epiphyseal growth plates. In short stature syndromes such as hypochondroplasia and Noonan syndrome, the activation level of the FGF-MAPK/ERK-pathway in epiphyseal growth plates is a determining factor for statural growth. In analogy, we propose that deregulation of the MAPK/ERK pathway in SoS results in altered hypertrophic differentiation of NSD1 expressing chondrocytes and may be a determining factor in statural overgrowth and accelerated skeletal maturation in SoS.","dc:creator":"Visser R","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"Sotos syndrome is associated with deregulation of the MAPK/ERK-signaling pathway."},"rdfs:label":"NSD1 expression in the human growth plate"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:aa1a412a-ee7d-4517-81ba-0ceead9668d1_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2876cd0e-9fc5-4625-970b-9efc264e4c87","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e09aee41-2b98-44ad-9f4b-5688d83d275f","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"R1914C and R2005Q have greatly reduced H3K36 HKMT activities.

The 1.7 Å structure of the catalytic domain of NSD1 presented here shows that a regulatory loop adopts a conformation that prevents free access of H3K36 to the bound S-adenosyl-L-methionine. Molecular dynamics simulation and computational docking revealed that this normally inhibitory loop can adopt an active conformation, allowing H3K36 access to the active site, and that the nucleosome may stabilize the active conformation of the regulatory loop.

Weaver syndrome is characterized by the same criteria but has its own distinctive facial gestalt. Recently, a 2.2-Mb chromosome 5q35 microdeletion, encompassing NSD1, was reported as the major cause of Sotos syndrome, with intragenic NSD1 mutations identified in a minority of cases. We evaluated 75 patients with childhood overgrowth, for intragenic mutations and large deletions of NSD1. The series was phenotypically scored into four groups, prior to the molecular analyses: the phenotype in group 1 (n=37) was typical of Sotos syndrome; the phenotype in group 2 (n=13) was Sotos-like but with some atypical features; patients in group 3 (n=7) had Weaver syndrome, and patients in group 4 (n=18) had an overgrowth condition that was neither Sotos nor Weaver syndrome. We detected three deletions and 32 mutations (13 frameshift, 8 nonsense, 2 splice-site, and 9 missense) that are likely to impair NSD1 functions. The truncating mutations were spread throughout NSD1, but there was evidence of clustering of missense mutations in highly conserved functional domains between exons 13 and 23. There was a strong correlation between presence of an NSD1 alteration and clinical phenotype, in that 28 of 37 (76%) patients in group 1 had NSD1 mutations or deletions, whereas none of the patients in group 4 had abnormalities of NSD1. Three patients with Weaver syndrome had NSD1 mutations, all between amino acids 2142 and 2184.

Variants in this gene usually occur de novo but can be inherited (e.g Hoglund et al 2003). Microdeletions that encompass the entire NSD1 gene are a common cause of Sotos Syndrome and tend to be associated with more severe learning disability than intragenic pathogenic variants (Tatton-Brown et al. 2005).\n\nMore evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached.\n\nThe mechanism for disease is haploinsufficiency (Kurotaki et al. 2002).\n\nThis gene-disease association is supported by expression studies and in vitro functional assays.\n\nIn summary, NSD1 is definitively associated with Autosomal Dominant Sotos Syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.\n\nThis classification was approved by the ClinGen ID/Autism Working Group on 10/26/2018.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:aa1a412a-ee7d-4517-81ba-0ceead9668d1"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
