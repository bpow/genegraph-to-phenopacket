It is characterized by ineffective erythropoiesis and by the presence of bi- and multinucleated erythroblasts in bone marrow, with nuclei of equal size and DNA content, suggesting a cytokinesis disturbance. Other features of the peripheral red blood cells are protein and lipid dysglycosylation and endoplasmic reticulum double-membrane remnants. Development of other hematopoietic lineages is normal. Individuals with CDAII show progressive splenomegaly, gallstones and iron overload potentially with liver cirrhosis or cardiac failure. Here we show that the gene encoding the secretory COPII component SEC23B is mutated in CDAII. Short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated suppression of SEC23B expression recapitulates the cytokinesis defect. Knockdown of zebrafish sec23b also leads to aberrant erythrocyte development. Our results provide in vivo evidence for SEC23B selectivity in erythroid differentiation and show that SEC23A and SEC23B, although highly related paralogous secretory COPII components, are nonredundant in erythrocyte maturation.","dc:creator":"Schwarz K","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"Mutations affecting the secretory COPII coat component SEC23B cause congenital dyserythropoietic anemia type II."},"rdfs:label":"Expression-level evidence (CD34+ cells)"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:b6093e90-7ec2-4cdb-9323-b67df78930a3_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5cdbefbd-69a7-4560-b6e6-c92497901ca5","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ab2441bb-c65f-40f9-b2aa-04503cf081db","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"The anemia and low hemoglobin levels seen in the mice are similar to the phenotypes in humans.

Recent studies indicated that CDAII is caused by a defect disturbing Golgi processing in erythroblasts. A linkage analysis located a candidate region on chromosome 20, termed the CDAN2 locus, in the majority of CDAII patients but the aberrant gene has not so far been elucidated. We used a proteomic-genomic approach to identify SEC23B as the candidate gene for CDAII by matching the recently published data on the cytoplasmic proteome of human RBCs with the chromosomic localization of CDAN2 locus. Sequencing analysis of SEC23B gene in 13 CDAII patients from 10 families revealed 12 different mutations: six missense (c.40C>T, c.325G>A, c.1043A>C, c.1489C>T, c.1808C>T, and c.2101C>T), two frameshift (c.428_428delAinsCG and c.1821delT), one splicing (c.689+1G>A), and three nonsense (c.568C>T, c.649C>T, and c.1660C>T). Mutations c.40C>T and c.325G>A were detected in unrelated patients. SEC23B is a member of the Sec23/Sec24 family, a component of the COPII coat protein complex involved in protein transport through membrane vesicles. Abnormalities in this gene are likely to disturb endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-to-Golgi trafficking, affecting different glycosylation pathways and ultimately accounting for the cellular phenotype observed in CDAII.","dc:creator":"Bianchi P","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"Congenital dyserythropoietic anemia type II (CDAII) is caused by mutations in the SEC23B gene."}},{"id":"cggv:ca22780e-93b9-41b3-826f-c70fe12e2c78_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:7585ab72-cd57-4f38-b375-2c4b2e9dbc2c"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19621418"}],"rdfs:label":"p.Arg14Trp & p.Asp143AlafsTer35 in trans"},{"id":"cggv:6e58b10d-8bfa-4e07-a3e4-c9190c98bdf0","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6e58b10d-8bfa-4e07-a3e4-c9190c98bdf0_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:6e58b10d-8bfa-4e07-a3e4-c9190c98bdf0_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"No","dc:description":"Please note that this variant is notated slightly differently in the paper, as p.Asp143Alafs*35 (c.428_428delAinsCG).

(PMID: 19621418) & Schwarz et al. (PMID:19561605)). Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found differences in inheritance pattern and phenotypic variability. Therefore, the following disease entities have been split into two disease entities: autosomal recessive CDAN2 (OMIM: 224100) & autosomal dominant Cowden Syndrome 7 (OMIM: 616858). A separate curation for Cowden Syndrome 7 was deemed not necessary by the Prenatal GCEP. 17 variants (missense, nonsense, splicing, frameshift) that have been reported in well over 20 probands probands in 4 publications (PMIDs: 19561605, 19621418, 27471141, 37373084) are included in this curation. Much more evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The prenatal phenotype includes fetal hydrops and anemia requiring transfusions before birth. The literature suggests that biallelic loss-of-function variants in SEC23B are incompatible with life. Neonatal jaundice and anemia are common in patients. The mechanism of pathogenicity is reported to be loss-of-function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence (mouse model, expression-level evidence (PMIDs: 19561605, 34954140)). Expression-level data shows that SEC23B is expressed during differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells. The mouse model shows significant reduction in red blood cell count, hemoglobin levels, and hematocrit in the mutant mice compared to the wild-type. In summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between SEC23B and autosomal recessive CDANII. This been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Prenatal GCEP on the meeting date 10/2/2024 (SOP Version 10).
