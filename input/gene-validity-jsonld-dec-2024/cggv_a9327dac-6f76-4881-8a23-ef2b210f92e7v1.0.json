Next-generation sequencing has highlighted the crucial contribution of de novo mutations to the genetic architecture of EEs as well as to their underlying genetic heterogeneity. Our previous whole-exome sequencing study of 264 parent-child trios revealed more than 290 candidate genes in which only a single individual had a de novo variant. We sought to identify additional pathogenic variants in a subset (n = 27) of these genes via targeted sequencing in an unsolved cohort of 531 individuals with a diverse range of EEs. We report 17 individuals with pathogenic variants in seven of the 27 genes, defining a genetic etiology in 3.2% of this unsolved cohort. Our results provide definitive evidence that de novo mutations in SLC1A2 and CACNA1A cause specific EEs and expand the compendium of clinically relevant genotypes for GABRB3. We also identified EEs caused by genetic variants in ALG13, DNM1, and GNAO1 and report a mutation in IQSEC2. Notably, recurrent mutations accounted for 7/17 of the pathogenic variants identified. As a result of high-depth coverage, parental mosaicism was identified in two out of 14 cases tested with mutant allelic fractions of 5%-6% in the unaffected parents, carrying significant reproductive counseling implications. These results confirm that dysregulation in diverse cellular neuronal pathways causes EEs, and they will inform the diagnosis and management of individuals with these devastating disorders.","dc:creator":"Epi4K Consortium","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"De Novo Mutations in SLC1A2 and CACNA1A Are Important Causes of Epileptic Encephalopathies."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27476654","rdfs:label":"EG0258"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Not scored because this variant segregates with GEFS+ in the individual's family.

Recently, GABRB3 mutations have been identified in a few patients with infantile spasms and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. We report the clinical and electrographic features of a novel case of GABRB3-related early-onset epileptic encephalopathy. Our patient presented with neonatal hypotonia and feeding difficulties, then developed pharmacoresistant epileptic encephalopathy, characterized by multiple seizure types from 3 months of age. Electroencephalography demonstrated ictal generalized and interictal multifocal epileptiform abnormalities. Using a SureSelectXT custom multiple gene panel covering 48 early infantile epileptic encephalopathy/developmental delay genes, a novel de novo GABRB3 heterozygous missense mutation, c.860C>T (p.Thr287Ile), was identified and confirmed on Sanger sequencing. GABRB3 is an emerging cause of early-onset epilepsy. Novel genetic technologies, such as whole-exome/genome sequencing and multiple gene panels, will undoubtedly identify further cases, allowing more detailed electroclinical delineation of the GABRB3-related genotypic and phenotypic spectra.

We sought to obtain insights into the molecular mechanisms that might link defects in GABAA receptor biophysics and biogenesis to patients with EOEE. The mutant residues are part of conserved structural domains such as the Cys-loop (L170R) and M2-M3 loop (A305V) that form the GABA binding/channel gating coupling junction and the channel pore (T288N), which are functionally coupled during receptor activation. The mutant coupling junction residues caused rearrangements and formation of new hydrogen bonds in the open state, while the mutant pore residue reshaped the pore cavity. Whereas mutant coupling junction residues uncoupled during activation and caused gain of function, the mutant pore residue favoured low conductance receptors and differential sensitivity to diazepam and loss of function. These data reveal novel molecular mechanisms by which EOEE-linked mutations affect GABAA receptor function.","dc:creator":"Hernandez CC","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"GABA A Receptor Coupling Junction and Pore GABRB3 Mutations are Linked to Early-Onset Epileptic Encephalopathy."},"rdfs:label":"Hernandez Functional Evidence"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Upgraded because p.L170R, p.A305V, and T288N were shown to have a pathogenic effect."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:a9327dac-6f76-4881-8a23-ef2b210f92e7_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:827f2298-40c3-4724-bf24-4c4c259ac3fa","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:753b45ff-c3c8-46cd-89da-e09ac7b05732","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Result of mouse knockout is a varying age range of mice, which they age-matched with control mice. gabrb3-/- mice were hyperactive.

Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level and experimental data. Many de novo missense variants have been reported in humans, which reaches the maximum score for genetic evidence (Epi4K Consortium et al. 2016, 27476654; Zhang et al. 2015, 26544041; Le et al. 2017, 28544625; Sterbova et al. 2018, 29444535). This gene-disease association is supported by functional alteration evidence and mouse models (Janve et al. 2016, 26950270; Hernandez et al. 2017, 29162865; Moller et al. 2017, 28053010; DeLorey et al. 2008, 17983671; Ferguson et al. 2007; 17927825). A global knockout and a forebrain selective knockout mouse model were each scored for replicating seizure phenotypes, but were downgraded because the homozygous models do not replicate the heterozygous mechanism observed in humans. Of note, missense variants have been reported to segregate in three families with familial GEFS+. One affected individual of each family is likely a phenocopy, as they do not carry the reported GABRB3 variant (Moller et al. 2017, 28053010). These families were not curated as part of the GABRB3-autosomal dominant developmental epileptic encephalopathy. In summary, GABRB3 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant developmental epileptic encephalopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Epilepsy Gene Curation Expert Panel on 2/5/2019.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:a9327dac-6f76-4881-8a23-ef2b210f92e7"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
