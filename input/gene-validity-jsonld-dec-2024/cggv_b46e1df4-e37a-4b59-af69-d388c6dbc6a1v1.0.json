RP is genetically heterogeneous and the genes identified to date encode proteins involved in a wide range of functional pathways, including photoreceptor development, phototransduction, the retinoid cycle, cilia, and outer segment development. Here we report the identification of biallelic mutations in Receptor Expression Enhancer Protein 6 (REEP6) in seven individuals with autosomal-recessive RP from five unrelated families. REEP6 is a member of the REEP/Yop1 family of proteins that influence the structure of the endoplasmic reticulum but is relatively unstudied. The six variants identified include three frameshift variants, two missense variants, and a genomic rearrangement that disrupts exon 1. Human 3D organoid optic cups were used to investigate REEP6 expression and confirmed the expression of a retina-specific isoform REEP6.1, which is specifically affected by one of the frameshift mutations. Expression of the two missense variants (c.383C>T [p.Pro128Leu] and c.404T>C [p.Leu135Pro]) and the REEP6.1 frameshift mutant in cultured cells suggest that these changes destabilize the protein. Furthermore, CRISPR-Cas9-mediated gene editing was used to produce Reep6 knock-in mice with the p.Leu135Pro RP-associated variant identified in one RP-affected individual. The homozygous knock-in mice mimic the clinical phenotypes of RP, including progressive photoreceptor degeneration and dysfunction of the rod photoreceptors. Therefore, our study implicates REEP6 in retinal homeostasis and highlights a pathway previously uncharacterized in retinal dystrophy.","dc:creator":"Arno G","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"Mutations in REEP6 Cause Autosomal-Recessive Retinitis Pigmentosa."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b46e1df4-e37a-4b59-af69-d388c6dbc6a1_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3c01c96a-c18e-4308-b664-878d5d4a087d_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3c01c96a-c18e-4308-b664-878d5d4a087d","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":14,"allele":{"id":"cggv:bb342cc7-6075-43a7-a3e8-c8ad4d832234","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_138393.4(REEP6):c.279_280del (p.Leu94ValfsTer?)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA645372276"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"late teens fields loss, Myope, Attenuated vessels, midperipheral RPE atrophy and bone spicule hyperpigmentation, CME, PERG normal; rod ERG undetectable; delayed and profoundly reduced cone specific responses.

We then performed immuno-electron microscopy (EM) of vesicles isolated from bovine retina extracts using anti-REEP6 antibody. REEP6 gold particles were detected on a subset of vesicles that exhibited triskelion structure characteristic of Clathrin-coated vesicles (Fig. 4D). To investigate co-localization of REEP6 and Clathrin, we did high resolution immunofluorescence microscopy using adult mouse retina sections. As reported previously (30,31), REEP6 labeling was evident throughout the rod photoreceptor with intense labeling in the outer plexiform layer (OPL) associated with spherules (rod-specific pre-synaptic morphology) (Fig. 4E, upper panel). Clathrin is ubiquitously expressed in rods but is also present at high levels in plexiform layers of the retina (Fig. 4E, middle panel showing OPL). At higher magnification, we detected co-localization of REEP6 (green) and Clathrin (red) to vesicles in rod spherules (Fig. 4F). The dark profile within each circular rod spherule represents a mitochondrion located near the ribbon synapse. REEP6 containing vesicles are also visible in the rod cytoplasm in the outer nuclear layer. A region of interest (ROI) comprised of rod spherules was analyzed to assess the extent of REEP6 and Clathrin co-localization. This region yielded a Pearson’s correlation coefficient of 0.541 when calculated with Volocity co-localization software and utilizing auto-thresholding features.

However, knowledge on how transcriptome complexity is translated into functional complexity remains limited.

In this report, we investigated the function and relationship of the two isoforms of Reep6, namely Reep6.1 and Reep6.2, in rod photoreceptor cells. These two isoforms result from the alternative splicing of exon 5 and show mutually exclusive expression patterns. Reep6.2 is the canonical isoform that is expressed in non-retinal tissues, whereas Reep6.1 is the only expressed isoform in the adult retina. The Reep6.1 isoform-specific knockout mouse, Reep6E5/E5, is generated by deleting exon 5 and a homozygous deletion phenotypically displayed a rod degeneration phenotype comparable to a Reep6 full knockout mouse, indicating that the Reep6.1 isoform is essential for the rod photoreceptor cell survival. Consistent with the results obtained from a loss-of-function experiment, overexpression of Reep6.2 failed to rescue the rod degeneration phenotype of Reep6 knockout mice whereas overexpression of Reep6.1 does lead to rescue. These results demonstrate that, consistent with the expression pattern of the isoform, Reep6.1 has rod-specific functions that cannot be substituted by its canonical isoform.

Affected individuals with causal variants in *REEP6* have since been identified in 3 other publications (PMID: 29120066, 31538292 and 33917198), with cases showing onset at ages ranging from early childhood to 39 years. Presenting phenotypes include a combination of nyctalopia, bony spicules, constricted visual fields, reduced visual acuity, attenuated retinal vessels, severe generalized retinal dystrophy with severely reduced or undetectable electroretinogram (ERG) responses and outer retinal atrophy.  Additional features can include cystoid macular edema, posterior subcapsular cataracts and dyschromatopsia. These cases with causal variants in *REEP6* are typically diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa 77 (MONDO:0015013, MIM #: 617304), but have been curated under the broader disease term REEP6-related retinopathy in order to be inclusive of the full diversity of patient phenotypes.\n\nThis curation has scored ten suspected deleterious variants in *REEP6* (four missense, four frameshift, one nonsense and one canonical splice site), which have been collectively reported in nine probands in four publications (PMIDs: 27889058, 29120066, 31538292 and 33917198). Most of the probands were members of consanguineous families and were homozygous for the variant of interest. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss of function in REEP6, characterized in at least some cases by variants predicted to trigger the absence of the gene product. More genetic evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence has been reached (PMID: 36819107).\n\nThis gene-disease association is also supported by expression evidence that the long isoform (*REEP6.1*) of *REEP6* is highly expressed in the retina, specifically in rod photoreceptors (PMIDs: 34104971 and 24691551). Biochemical studies further support a structural function of REEP6 in the retina as evidenced by strong binding of NRL (associated with retinal degeneration and retinitis pigmentosa 27) in the intronic region of *REEP6*, which increases its promoter activity in an *in vitro* reporter assay (PMID: 24691551). Furthermore, REEP6 is present in a subset of clathrin-coated vesicles (STX3) and colocalizes in rod spherules. This study suggests a critical function of REEP6 in trafficking of cargo via a subset of clathrin-coated vesicles to selected membrane sites in rod photoreceptor cells (28369466). Knockdown of *Reep6* in mouse retina using shRNA might lead to the death of transfected photoreceptor cells as shown by thinner outer nuclear layer in the electroporated area. Knockdown of reep6 by translation blocking morpholino in zebrafish leads to severely compromised eye development in the morphants. Taken together, these results show that *REEP6* is required for retinal development in zebrafish and mouse (24691551). *Reep6L135P/-* compound heterozygous mice mimic the patient genotype and recapitulate the early-onset retinal degeneration phenotypes observed in the individual with retinitis pigmentosa. rAAV-mediated *REEP6* transduction in photoreceptor cells successfully rescued the phenotypes including thin outer nuclear layer and rod ERG responses (PMIDs: 30101608 and 34104971). \n\nIn summary, *REEP6* is definitively associated with REEP6-related retinopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both research and diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time without the emergence of contradictory evidence, leading to a definitive classification. This classification has been approved by the ClinGen Retina GCEP on July 11th, 2024 (SOP Version 10).
