Pur alpha binds to human BC200 RNA, implicated in dendritic targeting, and this has homologies to 7SL RNA, implicated in compartmentalized translation. Results using hippocampal rat neurons in situ show that Pur alpha binds to BC1 RNA, implicated in dendritic targeting as a mouse counterpart of BC200, and to mRNA molecules translated in dendrites; Pur alpha is specifically located in dendrites, where it is colocalized with Map2, but not in axons, where it fails to colocalize with Ankyrin G. Pur alpha and Staufen are colocalized at dendritic sites of mRNA translation. Microtubule disruptors inhibit Pur alpha dendritic targeting and allow its mislocalization to axons. Using mouse brain, double-RNA immunoprecipitation places Pur alpha together with Staufen or FMRP on BC1 RNA and specific mRNA species in vivo.

Deletions of the PURA gene are frequent in acute myeloid leukemia. Mice with targeted disruption of the PURA gene in both alleles appear normal at birth, but at 2 weeks of age, they develop neurological problems manifest by severe tremor and spontaneous seizures and they die by 4 weeks. There are severely lower numbers of neurons in regions of the hippocampus and cerebellum of PURA(-/-) mice versus those of age-matched +/+ littermates, and lamination of these regions is aberrant at time of death. Immunohistochemical analysis of MCM7, a protein marker for DNA replication, reveals a lack of proliferation of precursor cells in these regions in the PURA(-/-) mice. Levels of proliferation were also absent or low in several other tissues of the PURA(-/-) mice, including those of myeloid lineage, whereas those of PURA(+/-) mice were intermediate. Evaluation of brain sections indicates a reduction in myelin and glial fibrillary acidic protein labeling in oligodendrocytes and astrocytes, respectively, indicating pathological development of these cells. At postnatal day 5, a critical time for cerebellar development, Puralpha and Cdk5 were both at peak levels in bodies and dendrites of Purkinje cells of PURA(+/+) mice, but both were absent in dendrites of PURA(-/-) mice. Puralpha and Cdk5 can be coimmunoprecipitated from brain lysates of PURA(+/+) mice. Immunohistochemical studies reveal a dramatic reduction in the level of both phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated neurofilaments in dendrites of the Purkinje cell layer and of synapse formation in the hippocampus.

Purα(-/-) mice were born with no obvious pathological condition. We obtained convincing evidence that lack of Purα prolongs the postnatal proliferation of neuronal precursor cells both in the hippocampus and in the cerebellum, however, without affecting the overall number of postmitotic neurons. Independent of these findings, we observed alterations in the expression and distribution of the dendritic protein MAP2, the translation of which has been proposed previously to be Purα-dependent. At the age of 2 weeks, Purα(-/-) mice generated a continuous tremor which persisted throughout lifetime. Finally, adult Purα(-/-) mice displayed a megalencephaly and histopathological findings including axonal swellings and hyperphosphorylation of neurofilaments.
