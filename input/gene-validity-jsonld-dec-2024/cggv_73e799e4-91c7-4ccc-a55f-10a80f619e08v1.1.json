Using Sanger and exome sequencing in a CMS patient, we identified two heteroallelic mutations, p.Glu1233Lys and p.Arg1277His, in LRP4 coding for the postsynaptic low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 4. LRP4, expressed on the surface of the postsynaptic membrane of the neuromuscular junction, is a receptor for neurally secreted agrin, and LRP4 bound by agrin activates MuSK. Activated MuSK in concert with Dok-7 stimulates rapsyn to concentrate and anchor AChR on the postsynaptic membrane and interacts with other proteins implicated in the assembly and maintenance of the neuromuscular junction. LRP4 also functions as an inhibitor of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. The identified mutations in LRP4 are located at the edge of its 3rd beta-propeller domain and decrease binding affinity of LRP4 for both MuSK and agrin. Mutations in the LRP4 3rd beta-propeller domain were previously reported to impair Wnt signaling and cause bone diseases including Cenani-Lenz syndactyly syndrome and sclerosteosis-2. By analyzing naturally occurring and artificially introduced mutations in the LRP4 3rd beta-propeller domain, we show that the edge of the domain regulates the MuSK signaling whereas its central cavity governs Wnt signaling. We conclude that LRP4 is a new CMS disease gene and that the 3rd beta propeller domain of LRP4 mediates the two signaling pathways in a position-specific manner.","dc:creator":"Ohkawara B","dc:date":"2014","dc:title":"LRP4 third β-propeller domain mutations cause novel congenital myasthenia by compromising agrin-mediated MuSK signaling in a position-specific manner."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:73e799e4-91c7-4ccc-a55f-10a80f619e08_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:73e799e4-91c7-4ccc-a55f-10a80f619e08_ar_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalRecessiveVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:829c0a48-bdee-4ceb-853e-b94d626c9cbb_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:829c0a48-bdee-4ceb-853e-b94d626c9cbb","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":17,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:7732989b-e6ff-48c7-a3a9-c9b995cfb411","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_002334.4(LRP4):c.3697G>A (p.Glu1233Lys)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA199514"}},{"id":"cggv:681d2304-c550-4c1d-a014-d740a09df437","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_002334.4(LRP4):c.3830G>A (p.Arg1277His)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA199516"}}],"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"Limited lateral eye movements, abnormal size and shape of synaptic endplates, decreased numbers of postsynaptic nerve terminals at the neuromuscular junction","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0003403","obo:HP_0002355","obo:HP_0011968","obo:HP_0002098","obo:HP_0000508","obo:HP_0001265","obo:HP_0003803","obo:HP_0001324"],"secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Female","variant":[{"id":"cggv:fa55cdaf-85c9-43bb-9666-6b90115e250a_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:681d2304-c550-4c1d-a014-d740a09df437"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24234652"},{"id":"cggv:f32f22ae-bfee-496f-a48a-048e74d425d5_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:7732989b-e6ff-48c7-a3a9-c9b995cfb411"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24234652"}],"rdfs:label":"Ohkawara Proband"},{"id":"cggv:fa55cdaf-85c9-43bb-9666-6b90115e250a","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:fa55cdaf-85c9-43bb-9666-6b90115e250a_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:fa55cdaf-85c9-43bb-9666-6b90115e250a_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"In vitro functional expression studies showed that the variant decreased binding affinity of LRP4 for agrin (AGRN) and MuSK and did not enhance downstream activation of the MuSK signaling pathway, thus impairing clustering of AChRs.

Its expression enables agrin binding and MuSK signaling in cells that otherwise do not respond to agrin. Suppression of LRP4 expression in muscle cells attenuates agrin binding, agrin-induced MuSK tyrosine phosphorylation, and AChR clustering. LRP4 also forms a complex with MuSK in a manner that is stimulated by agrin. Finally, we showed that LRP4 becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated in agrin-stimulated muscle cells.

Its formation requires neuronal agrin that acts by binding to LRP4 to stimulate MuSK. Mutations have been identified in agrin, MuSK, and LRP4 in patients with congenital myasthenic syndrome, and patients with myasthenia gravis develop antibodies against agrin, LRP4, and MuSK. However, it remains unclear whether the agrin signaling pathway is critical for NMJ maintenance because null mutation of any of the three genes is perinatal lethal. In this study, we generated imKO mice, a mutant strain whose LRP4 gene can be deleted in muscles by doxycycline (Dox) treatment. Ablation of the LRP4 gene in adult muscle enabled studies of its role in NMJ maintenance. We demonstrate that Dox treatment of P30 mice reduced muscle strength and compound muscle action potentials. AChR clusters became fragmented with diminished junctional folds and synaptic vesicles. The amplitude and frequency of miniature endplate potentials were reduced, indicating impaired neuromuscular transmission and providing cellular mechanisms of adult LRP4 deficiency. We showed that LRP4 ablation led to the loss of synaptic agrin and the 90 kDa fragments, which occurred ahead of other prejunctional and postjunctional components, suggesting that LRP4 may regulate the stability of synaptic agrin. These observations demonstrate that LRP4 is essential for maintaining the structural and functional integrity of the NMJ and that loss of muscle LRP4 in adulthood alone is sufficient to cause myasthenic symptoms.","dc:creator":"Barik A","dc:date":"2014","dc:title":"LRP4 is critical for neuromuscular junction maintenance."},"rdfs:label":"Lrp4-null mice"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4}],"evidenceStrength":"Limited","sequence":7653,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria10","strengthScore":5,"subject":{"id":"cggv:0725a52e-a096-4cd5-aca4-cb1e1102f6bf","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0014578","gene":"hgnc:6696","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.1","dc:description":"The LRP4 gene is located on chromosome 11 at 11p11.2, encodes a receptor for agrin and is critical for the formation and maintenance of the neuromuscular junction. LRP4 was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive congenital myasthenic syndrome 17 in 2014 (Ohkawara et al., PMID: 24234652). Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found differences in phenotypic variability. Therefore, congenital myasthenic syndrome 17 (OMIM:616304) has been split into a separate disease entity, Cenani-Lenz syndactyly syndrome (OMIM:212780) and sclerosteosis 2 (OMIM:614305) have been lumped together. The split curation for autosomal recessive Cenani-Lenz syndactyly syndrome has been curated separately. Two variants (c.3697G>A (p.Glu1233Lys) and c.3830G>A (p.Arg1277His)) which have been reported in one proband in one publication (PMID: 24234652) are included in this curation. The mechanism of pathogenicity is reported to be biallelic loss of function, inhibiting LRP4’s affinity for MuSK and agrin. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by an animal model, expression studies, in vitro functional assays, and biochemical function (PMIDs: 18957220, 24234652, 25319686). Conditional knockdown of Lrp4 in mice displayed progressive loss of muscle mass and strength, scoliosis, and ultimately death, consistent with a myasthenic phenotype (PMID: 25319686). Artificially engineered variants at the same functional domain as those observed in the proband (3rd β-propeller domain) compromised agrin-mediated upregulation of MuSK signaling (PMID: 24234652). The expression of LRP4 in myotubes and concentration at the neuromuscular junction as well as its role in attenuating neuronal agrin binding, MuSK activation, and induction of AChR clustering in muscle cells support this gene-disease relationship (PMID: 18957220). In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship.
