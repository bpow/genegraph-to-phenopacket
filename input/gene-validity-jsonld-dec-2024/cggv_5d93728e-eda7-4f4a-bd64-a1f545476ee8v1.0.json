Although in research settings NGS has pinpointed causal alleles using segregation in large families, the key challenge for clinical diagnosis is application to single individuals. To explore its diagnostic use, we performed targeted NGS in 42 unrelated infants with clinical and biochemical evidence of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation disease. These devastating mitochondrial disorders are characterized by phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity, with more than 100 causal genes identified to date. We performed \"MitoExome\" sequencing of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and exons of ~1000 nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial proteins and prioritized rare mutations predicted to disrupt function. Because patients and healthy control individuals harbored a comparable number of such heterozygous alleles, we could not prioritize dominant-acting genes. However, patients showed a fivefold enrichment of genes with two such mutations that could underlie recessive disease. In total, 23 of 42 (55%) patients harbored such recessive genes or pathogenic mtDNA variants. Firm diagnoses were enabled in 10 patients (24%) who had mutations in genes previously linked to disease. Thirteen patients (31%) had mutations in nuclear genes not previously linked to disease. The pathogenicity of two such genes, NDUFB3 and AGK, was supported by complementation studies and evidence from multiple patients, respectively. The results underscore the potential and challenges of deploying NGS in clinical settings.","dc:creator":"Calvo SE","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"Molecular diagnosis of infantile mitochondrial disease with targeted next-generation sequencing."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5d93728e-eda7-4f4a-bd64-a1f545476ee8_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5d93728e-eda7-4f4a-bd64-a1f545476ee8_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:517f83fe-0e4c-4a5c-90d4-328cbf6c9c0c","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:97e06892-32ca-4d33-af52-b8d2826302cf","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionA"},"dc:description":"Well-described Complex I subunits/assembly factors","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27509854","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase), one of the largest membrane-bound enzymes in the cell, powers ATP synthesis in mammalian mitochondria by using the reducing potential of NADH to drive protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane. Mammalian complex I (ref. 1) contains 45 subunits, comprising 14 core subunits that house the catalytic machinery (and are conserved from bacteria to humans) and a mammalian-specific cohort of 31 supernumerary subunits. Knowledge of the structures and functions of the supernumerary subunits is fragmentary. Here we describe a 4.2-Å resolution single-particle electron cryomicroscopy structure of complex I from Bos taurus. We have located and modelled all 45 subunits, including the 31 supernumerary subunits, to provide the entire structure of the mammalian complex. Computational sorting of the particles identified different structural classes, related by subtle domain movements, which reveal conformationally dynamic regions and match biochemical descriptions of the 'active-to-de-active' enzyme transition that occurs during hypoxia. Our structures therefore provide a foundation for understanding complex I assembly and the effects of mutations that cause clinically relevant complex I dysfunctions, give insights into the structural and functional roles of the supernumerary subunits and reveal new information on the mechanism and regulation of catalysis.","dc:creator":"Zhu J","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"Structure of mammalian respiratory complex I."},"rdfs:label":"Complex I subunit"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":">10 gene products - 2 points per Mito GCEP guidance"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:5d93728e-eda7-4f4a-bd64-a1f545476ee8_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a3889c21-2af2-47a5-804b-9eaf817fa27f","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:97dc7d0a-f8ad-426c-9ea9-23f05fc78651","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"1 - does not grow in galactose indicating mitochondrial respiration defect (Fig 1)\n2 - severely reduces CI assembly (Fig 1)","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27626371","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) is the first enzyme of the mitochondrial respiratory chain and is composed of 45 subunits in humans, making it one of the largest known multi-subunit membrane protein complexes. Complex I exists in supercomplex forms with respiratory chain complexes III and IV, which are together required for the generation of a transmembrane proton gradient used for the synthesis of ATP. Complex I is also a major source of damaging reactive oxygen species and its dysfunction is associated with mitochondrial disease, Parkinson's disease and ageing. Bacterial and human complex I share 14 core subunits that are essential for enzymatic function; however, the role and necessity of the remaining 31 human accessory subunits is unclear. The incorporation of accessory subunits into the complex increases the cellular energetic cost and has necessitated the involvement of numerous assembly factors for complex I biogenesis. Here we use gene editing to generate human knockout cell lines for each accessory subunit. We show that 25 subunits are strictly required for assembly of a functional complex and 1 subunit is essential for cell viability. Quantitative proteomic analysis of cell lines revealed that loss of each subunit affects the stability of other subunits residing in the same structural module. Analysis of proteomic changes after the loss of specific modules revealed that ATP5SL and DMAC1 are required for assembly of the distal portion of the complex I membrane arm. Our results demonstrate the broad importance of accessory subunits in the structure and function of human complex I. Coupling gene-editing technology with proteomics represents a powerful tool for dissecting large multi-subunit complexes and enables the study of complex dysfunction at a cellular level.","dc:creator":"Stroud DA","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"Accessory subunits are integral for assembly and function of human mitochondrial complex I."},"rdfs:label":"KO in HEK293T cells"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"NDUFB3 KO in HEK293T cells shows severely reduced CI assembly (Fig 1)"},{"id":"cggv:42ce05b3-72d6-4c3f-8620-26b160c0f9ef","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b4999ad8-f0d1-4f6e-bba1-1779b86e17c5","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Figure 5 -  Fibroblasts from P3 showed complex I deficiency (~15% residual complex I activity when assayed by spectrophotometric enzyme assay, <2% residual  complex I activity when assayed by dipstick enzyme assay)","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22277967","rdfs:label":"NDUFB3 complementation of complex I defects in subject cells"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Fibroblasts from P3 (with homozygous c.64T>C, p.W22R in NDUFB3) showed complex I deficiency (~15% residual complex I activity when assayed by spectrophotometric enzyme assay, <2% residual  complex I activity when assayed by dipstick enzyme assay)"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:5d93728e-eda7-4f4a-bd64-a1f545476ee8_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6f4bfe11-c390-49b6-89b6-81b0ccbb3d85","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d62003f6-4305-4c50-bd06-ba80ef41da51","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:PhenotypeRescue"},"dc:description":"Expression of wild-type NDUFB3 increased complex I activity and protein  levels in fibroblasts from subject P3 but not from a previously diagnosed patient with complex I deficiency, who had pathogenic mutations in C8orf38 (14) and vice versa (Fig. 5).","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22277967","rdfs:label":"Complementation experiment, P3 fibroblasts"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellRescueCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Expression of wild-type NDUFB3 increased complex I activity and protein  levels in fibroblasts from subject P3 but not from a previously diagnosed patient with complex I deficiency, who had pathogenic mutations in C8orf38 (14) and vice versa (Fig. 5)."},{"id":"cggv:60b63c0a-7300-473d-a814-9928f8729c13","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8ab30740-5322-471b-8b0c-e42c1f803a65","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:PhenotypeRescue"},"dc:description":"Significant increase of complex I activity (figure 2).\n--CI content consistently low in naïve cells, but increased significantly after expression of the corresponding wild type cDNA (figure 2A).\n--NDUFB3wt in cells of patient 50845, led to a significant increase of complex I activity (figure 2B) \n--Impaired CI assembly evidenced in Figure 4 (after the transduction of the patient cell line with the NDUFB3wt, the amounts of mitochondrial supercomplexes in patient fibroblasts increased up to 43% of the control (not detectable in patient before).

The *NDUFB3* gene encodes NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) subunit B3, which is essential for complex I activity and assembly. Defects of this protein lead to complex I deficiency.\n\nThe *NDUFB3* gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive mitochondrial disease in 2012 (PMID: 22277967). While various names have been given to the constellation of features seen in those with NDUFB3-related disease, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the NDUFB3 phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included two variants identified in eleven cases [10 cases had homozygous c.64T>C (p.Trp22Arg); the 11th case was compound heterozygous for c.64T>C (p.Trp22Arg) and c.208G>T (p.Gly70Ter)] in four publications (PMIDs: 22277967, 22499348, 27091925, 31000363). Features seen in these cases include intrauterine growth restriction, oligohydramnios, failure to thrive, short stature, metabolic acidosis, lactic acidosis, developmental delay, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, arrhythmia (Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome), pulmonary hypertension, liver disease, and dysmorphic features (prominent forehead, smooth philtrum, deep-set eyes, low-set ears). No segregation data were available. Loss of function is implicated as the mechanism of disease. This gene-disease association is also supported by known biochemical function, functional alteration in patient cells, functional alteration in non-patient cells, and rescue in patient cells (PMIDs: 22277967, 22499348, 27626371, 27509854).\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support this gene-disease relationship, including that more than three years have elapsed since the first proposal of the association. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on February 7, 2022 (SOP Version 8).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:5d93728e-eda7-4f4a-bd64-a1f545476ee8"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
