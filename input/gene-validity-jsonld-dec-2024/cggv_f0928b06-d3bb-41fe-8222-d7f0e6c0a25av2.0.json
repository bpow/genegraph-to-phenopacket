Auditory tests implicated at least a cochlear defect in these patients. We mapped the deafness, autosomal recessive (DFNB) locus involved by linkage analysis to a 4.8 Mb region at chromosome 21q22.3-qter. Exclusion of the DFNB8/10 gene TMPRSS3, located in this chromosomal interval, led us to identify a new deafness locus, DFNB98. Whole exome sequencing allowed us to identify a homozygous frame-shifting mutation (c.1726G>T+c.1728delC) in the gene TSPEAR (thrombospondin-type laminin G domain and EAR repeats). This truncating mutation (p.V576LfsX37) impeded the secretion of the encoded protein by cells transfected with the mutated gene. Alternative splicing of TSPEAR transcripts predict two protein isoforms, 522 and 669 amino acids in length, both of which would be affected by the mutation. These isoforms are composed of a thrombospondin-type laminin G (TSP) domain followed by seven tandemly organized epilepsy-associated repeats (EARs), probably forming a β-propeller domain. Tspear is expressed in a variety of murine tissues. Only the larger Tspear transcript was found in the cochlea, and the protein was detected by immunofluorescence at the surface of the hair bundles of sensory cells. The mammalian EAR protein family includes six known members. Defects in four of them, i.e. Lgi1, Lgi2, Vlgr1 and, we show here, TSPEAR, cause disorders with auditory features: epilepsy, which can include auditory features in humans; audiogenic seizures in animals; and/or hearing impairments in humans and mice. These observations demonstrate that EAR-containing proteins are essential for the development and function of the auditory system.","dc:creator":"Delmaghani S","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"Defect in the gene encoding the EAR/EPTP domain-containing protein TSPEAR causes DFNB98 profound deafness."},"rdfs:label":"Expression in Murine Cochlea"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:f0928b06-d3bb-41fe-8222-d7f0e6c0a25a_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:83022c1c-d442-4e4c-8645-070923cf50b2","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:eaff0ae9-48f9-4b68-b5c1-ef012cc780c5","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Transfected HEK293 cells with the c.1726G>T+c.1728delC mutations in TSPEAR as well as the wild-type to determine that the termination of translation occurred in the sixth EAR repeat.

The diagnostic rate varied considerably based on phenotype and was highest for patients with a positive family history of hearing loss or when the loss was congenital and symmetric.

Thirty families segregating mid-frequency SNHL, in whom biallelic GJB2 mutations had been previously excluded, were selected from among 851 families in our DNA repository of SNHL.

One more proband was a compound heterozygote for a pathogenic variant and a variant of uncertain significance (VUS) in MYO15A gene. To date, MYO15A and TMPRSS3 have not yet been described in association with mid-frequency SNHL.

At least 5 unique variants (3 frameshift, 1 nonsense, 1 silent variant in splice consensus sequence) have been reported in at least 4 probands in 4 publications (PMIDs: 22678063, 26969326, 34795337, 37561809). A frameshift variant that was reported in 2 probands and segregated in 2 additional family members (PMID: 22678063, 37561809) has also been reported in 2 families with ectodermal dysplasia and normal hearing (PMID: 27736875). Another nonsense variant that was observed as a homozygous variant in a proband was found to be heterozygous in the proband’s affected sibling and unaffected mother (PMID: 34795337). Moreover, a heterozygous missense variant with no second variant was reported in 1 proband (PMID: 30733538). This gene-disease relationship is supported by expression studies in murine cochlear tissue as well as functional alteration studies of null variants in non-patient cells (PMID: 22678063). Additionally, a *TSPEAR* K14-Cre knockdown revealed effects of *Tspear* knockdown in mice hair follicles and *NOTCH1* signaling but was not assessed for hearing loss (PMID: 27736875). In summary, the relationship between *TSPEAR* and autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss has been disputed. More evidence is needed to either support or refute the role *TSPEAR* plays in this disease. This gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the ClinGen Hearing Loss GCEP on 09/26/2017 as per SOP v6. It was reevaluated on 10/31/2024 using SOP v11. As a result of this reevaluation, this record underwent a review to be consistent with SOP v11. New case level evidence has been reviewed, but the classification did not change (PMIDs: 30733538, 34795337, 37561809).\n\nThe TSPEAR gene has been associated with ARSNHL in 4 probands in 4 publications. 5 unique variants (3 frameshift, 1 nonsense, 1 silent variant in splice consensus sequence) have been reported in humans, and variants in this gene segregated with disease in 4 additional family members. While functional studies and evidence of 1 homozygous frameshift variant segregating with prelingual profound sensorineural hearing loss suggest that this gene may play a role in hearing, the same frameshift variant has also been reported in 2 families with ectodermal dysplasia and normal hearing (Peled 2012).  This is the main source of conflicting evidence for this gene. The presence of LOF variants in patients with ectodermal dysplasia and normal hearing suggests that this gene may not cause hearing loss, and therefore, this relationship is classified as Disputed. Moreover, variants in this gene have been identified heterozygous in individuals with hearing loss which is inconsistent with the mode of inheritance of this gene-disease relationship.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:f0928b06-d3bb-41fe-8222-d7f0e6c0a25a"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
