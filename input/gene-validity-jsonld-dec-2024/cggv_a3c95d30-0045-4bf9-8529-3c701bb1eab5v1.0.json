The course is chronic progressive with additional episodes of rapid deterioration, provoked by fever and minor head trauma. A previous study showed that mutations in the genes encoding the epsilon- or the beta-subunit of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF2B, a complex consisting of five subunits, cause the disease in most patients. Seven unsolved patients remained. The unsolved patients were investigated by mutation analysis of the genes encoding the alpha-, gamma-, and delta-subunit of eIF2B and the gene encoding the alpha-subunit of eIF2, because phosphorylation of this latter subunit regulates eIF2B activity. Mutations were found in the genes encoding the alpha- (1 patient), gamma- (2 patients), and delta-subunits (2 patients) of eIF2B, but no mutations were found in the gene encoding the alpha-subunit of eIF2. In 2, both less typical patients, no mutations were found. Mutations in all five genes eIF2B subunit genes can cause VWM. eIF2B is essential for the initiation of translation of RNA into protein and is involved in regulation of the process, especially under circumstances of stress, such as fever. A defect in eIF2B may explain the sensitivity to stress factors in vanishing white matter patients.","dc:creator":"van der Knaap MS","dc:date":"2002","dc:title":"Mutations in each of the five subunits of translation initiation factor eIF2B can cause leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a3c95d30-0045-4bf9-8529-3c701bb1eab5_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:17752528-8acb-4c17-a80b-2b4bdadd3f03_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:17752528-8acb-4c17-a80b-2b4bdadd3f03","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":54,"allele":{"id":"cggv:7172b4d0-d707-49be-8288-0e526e8b9863","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001034116.2(EIF2B4):c.728C>T (p.Pro243Leu)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA1576800"}},"firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0004302","obo:HP_0002352"],"secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:6fd00da7-f7dc-4fb9-abe4-5080930c84d5_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:7172b4d0-d707-49be-8288-0e526e8b9863"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15136673","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Recessive mutations in the five eucaryotic initiation factor 2B (eIF2B) subunits have been found in leukodystrophies of variable age at onset and severity.","dc:creator":"Fogli A","dc:date":"2004","dc:title":"The effect of genotype on the natural history of eIF2B-related leukodystrophies."}},"rdfs:label":"949"},{"id":"cggv:6fd00da7-f7dc-4fb9-abe4-5080930c84d5","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6fd00da7-f7dc-4fb9-abe4-5080930c84d5_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:6fd00da7-f7dc-4fb9-abe4-5080930c84d5_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Fogli et al. 2004 show GEF eIF2B activity in lymphocytes are decreased compared to healthy controls."}],"strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:31325a38-6e98-4f7f-a9a0-1988e13dcaf2_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:31325a38-6e98-4f7f-a9a0-1988e13dcaf2","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDeath","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":42,"allele":{"id":"cggv:738bc4ee-a68f-4cdc-85ba-c832602b122c","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001034116.2(EIF2B4):c.1447C>T (p.Arg483Trp)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA44509202"}},"firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0011968","obo:HP_0002104","obo:HP_0002509","obo:HP_0000252","obo:HP_0001250","obo:HP_0001347","obo:HP_0008936","obo:HP_0000741","obo:HP_0002352","obo:HP_0002013"],"secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:3a538048-7c23-441f-a54b-df62e654cd71_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:738bc4ee-a68f-4cdc-85ba-c832602b122c"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14566705","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter, also called \"childhood ataxia with central nervous system hypomyelination,\" is the first human disease related to mutations in any of the five genes encoding subunits of eukaryotic initiation factor eIF2B or any translation factor at all. eIF2B is essential in all cells of the body for protein synthesis and the regulation of this protein synthesis under different stress conditions. It is surprising that mutations in the eIF2B genes have been reported to lead to abnormalities of the white matter of the brain only, although it has been shown recently that ovarian failure may accompany the leukoencephalopathy. Another surprising observation is that the onset of the disease varies from early childhood to adulthood, with the exception of Cree leukoencephalopathy, a disease related to a particular mutation in one of the eIF2B genes, which invariably has its onset within the first year of life. We analyzed the eIF2B genes of nine patients with an antenatal- or early-infantile-onset encephalopathy and an early demise and found mutations in eight of the patients. In addition to signs of a serious encephalopathy, we found oligohydramnios, intrauterine growth retardation, cataracts, pancreatitis, hepatosplenomegaly, hypoplasia of the kidneys, and ovarian dysgenesis. Until now, no evidence had been found for a genotype-phenotype correlation, but the consistently severe phenotype in affected siblings among our patients and in Cree encephalopathy patients suggests an influence of the genotype on the phenotype.","dc:creator":"van der Knaap MS","dc:date":"2003","dc:title":"eIF2B-related disorders: antenatal onset and involvement of multiple organs."}},"rdfs:label":"Case 4"},{"id":"cggv:3a538048-7c23-441f-a54b-df62e654cd71","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3a538048-7c23-441f-a54b-df62e654cd71_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:3a538048-7c23-441f-a54b-df62e654cd71_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Liu et al. 2011 showed variant results in significant decrease in GEF eIF2B activity."}],"strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:31bb5b1b-1a51-4dc2-9a73-a946484b3bdb_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:31bb5b1b-1a51-4dc2-9a73-a946484b3bdb","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":14,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:3e1fc36a-acaf-41fd-8895-1ff3fd257f85","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001034116.2(EIF2B4):c.626G>A (p.Arg209Gln)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA1576829"}},{"id":"cggv:beb03f2e-5423-4279-bf42-1f4b735f1247","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001034116.2(EIF2B4):c.625C>T (p.Arg209Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA44512958"}}],"detectionMethod":"Not specified in paper.","phenotypeFreeText":"Symptoms provoked by traumatic event.","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0002066","obo:HP_0000529","obo:HP_0002352","obo:HP_0002061"],"sex":"Female","variant":[{"id":"cggv:ca11dbb9-95c4-487f-a72d-719deb4477e6_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:beb03f2e-5423-4279-bf42-1f4b735f1247"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22128017","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"To find imaging signs of active degenerative processes in vanishing white matter disease (VWM), six VWM patients and six matched controls underwent MR examinations. The data were analyzed with modified Scheltens scales for morphological findings and determined quantitatively for apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC). Single-voxel MR spectra were acquired at the parietal white matter and analyzed with LCModel. Typical VWM brain lesions were found in all patients accompanied by proton diffusion abnormalities: Increased ADC appeared in brain regions with severe myelin destruction in all patients, and reduced ADC in two of six younger patients in remaining white matter adjacent to the lesions or at the borders around the lesions, who had a short history of the disease (≤ 1 year). The MR spectroscopy revealed reductions of NAA, Cho, and Cr, which correlate to the grade of white matter abnormalities. An increase of myo-inositol as marker of reactive gliosis was missing. Thus, restricted proton diffusion was evident in younger VWM patients with short history of disease, which in combination with lack of reactive gliosis may reflect early white matter degeneration in VWM. The multimodal MR methods are useful for characterizing such tissue degeneration in brain in vivo.","dc:creator":"Ding XQ","dc:date":"2012","dc:title":"Imaging evidence of early brain tissue

Comprising 5 subunits, α-ε (eIF2Bε being the catalytic one), eIF2B has always been considered an αβγδε heteropentamer. We have analyzed the subunit interactions within mammalian eIF2B by using a combination of mass spectrometry and in vivo studies of overexpressed complexes to gain further insight into the subunit arrangement of the complex. Our data reveal that eIF2B is actually decameric, a dimer of eIF2B(βγδε) tetramers stabilized by 2 copies of eIF2Bα. We also demonstrate a pivotal role for eIF2Bδ in the formation of eIF2B(βγδε) tetramers. eIF2B(αβγδε)2 decamers show greater binding to eIF2 than to eIF2B(βγδε) tetramers, which may underlie the increased activity of the former. We examined the levels of eIF2B subunits in a panel of different mouse tissues and identified different levels of eIF2B subunits, particularly eIF2Bα, which implies heterogeneity in the cellular proportions of eIF2B(αβγδε) and eIF2B(βγδε) complexes, with important implications for the regulation of translation in individual cell types.","dc:creator":"Wortham NC","dc:date":"2014","dc:title":"Analysis of the subunit organization of the eIF2B complex reveals new insights into its structure and regulation."},"rdfs:label":"Protein Interaction"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:a3c95d30-0045-4bf9-8529-3c701bb1eab5_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6d849a7d-1e78-4b84-85ef-343ecc3bd4ab","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9c7d3a58-1a68-4571-abfd-903fc5e84d43","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Mouse model recapitulates motor deficits and abnormal CNS development seen in human disease.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26974157","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Vanishing white matter (VWM) is a fatal leukodystrophy that is caused by mutations in genes encoding subunits of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2B (eIF2B). Disease onset and severity are codetermined by genotype. White matter astrocytes and oligodendrocytes are almost exclusively affected; however, the mechanisms of VWM development remain unclear. Here, we used VWM mouse models, patients' tissue, and cell cultures to investigate whether astrocytes or oligodendrocytes are the primary affected cell type. We generated 2 mouse models with mutations (Eif2b5Arg191His/Arg191His and Eif2b4Arg484Trp/Arg484Trp) that cause severe VWM in humans and then crossed these strains to develop mice with various mutation combinations. Phenotypic severity was highly variable and dependent on genotype, reproducing the clinical spectrum of human VWM. In all mutant strains, impaired maturation of white matter astrocytes preceded onset and paralleled disease severity and progression. Bergmann glia and retinal Müller cells, nonforebrain astrocytes that have not been associated with VWM, were also affected, and involvement of these cells was confirmed in VWM patients. In coculture, VWM astrocytes secreted factors that inhibited oligodendrocyte maturation, whereas WT astrocytes allowed normal maturation of VWM oligodendrocytes. These studies demonstrate that astrocytes are central in VWM pathomechanisms and constitute potential therapeutic targets. Importantly, astrocytes should also be considered in the pathophysiology of other white matter disorders.","dc:creator":"Dooves S","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"Astrocytes are central in the pathomechanisms of vanishing white matter."},"rdfs:label":"Mouse model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:bce18005-0f09-45aa-bb9b-2edb5dcb5a42","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:987c3ee8-0c16-43f6-8cfb-171460c28254","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Model recapitulates motor impairment and abnormal CNS development seen in patients with VWM.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33300869","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Vanishing white matter disease (VWM) is a severe leukodystrophy of the central nervous system caused by mutations in subunits of the eukaryotic initiation factor 2B complex (eIF2B).

Affected individuals present with gait dysfunction, spasticity, cognitive decline, and white matter abnormalities on MRI.  Some females develop ovarian failure. Onset is variable from infancy to adulthood, and progression of disease is often in the setting of fever, trauma, or stress. Vanishing white matter disease has also been referred to as Childhood Ataxia with Central Nervous System Hypomyelination (CACH). Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found that a phenotypic spectrum exists and there is no difference in molecular mechanism or inheritance pattern. Therefore, we chose to curate this gene-disease relationship under the disease term leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter 4 (OMIM:620314, MONDO:0957872). \n\nEight variants (missense, nonsense, canonical) that have been reported in 8 probands in 4 publications (PMIDs: 11835386, 15136673, 14566705, 22128017) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is reported to be loss of function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence (PMIDs: 33300869, 26974157, 24532666). The zebrafish model is associated with impaired motor behavior and abnormal CNS development. The mouse model is associated with growth restriction, progressive ataxia, epileptic seizures. Protein interaction studies have shown that the subunit encoded by EIF2B4 interacts with the subunit of a previously curated gene EIF2B5.  In summary, definitive evidence supports the relationship between EIF2B4 and leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter 4. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Leukodystrophy and Leukoencephalopathy GCEP on the meeting date December 4, 2024 (SOP Version 11).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:a3c95d30-0045-4bf9-8529-3c701bb1eab5"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
