JLN syndrome is a rare disease, which seems to affect less than one percent of all deaf children. Linkage to chromosome 11p15.5 markers was found by analysing four consanguinous families. Recombinants allowed us to map the JLN gene between D11S922 and D11S4146, to a 6-cM interval where KVLQT1, a potassium channel gene causing Romano-Ward (RW) syndrome, the dominant form of long QT syndrome, has been previously localized. An homozygous deletion-insertion event (1244, -7 +8) in the C-terminal domain of this gene was detected in three affected children of two families. We found that KVLQT1 is expressed in the stria vascularis of mouse inner ear by in situ hybridization. Taken together, our data indicate that KVLQT1 is responsible for both JLN and RW syndromes and has a key role not only in the ventricular repolarization but also in normal hearing, probably via the control of endolymph homeostasis.","dc:creator":"Neyroud N","dc:date":"1997","dc:title":"A novel mutation in the potassium channel gene KVLQT1 causes the Jervell and Lange-Nielsen cardioauditory syndrome."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2cb5cd32-6663-48bc-b8b0-3b9ca34e2cb7_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c367a8c3-de9d-4c5e-89b8-388c9980d2be_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c367a8c3-de9d-4c5e-89b8-388c9980d2be","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":66,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:157a2955-837c-47d2-b543-6c25a6f52828","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000218.3(KCNQ1):c.775C>G (p.Arg259Gly)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA379131099"}},{"id":"cggv:42b21a36-ac75-4a73-9568-369450302c39","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000218.3(KCNQ1):c.853_861delinsTACTTTGTGTACCTCGTACTTT (p.Lys285TyrfsTer?)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA658655515"}}],"detectionMethod":"sequenced the KCNQ1, KCNH2, SCN5A, KCNE1, and KCNE2\ncoding exons (plus at least five intron flanking nucleotides) through\nnext generation sequencing with semiconductor chip and the Ion\nTorrent PGM","firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypeFreeText":"bilateral hearing loss at 9 months, epilepsy diagnosed at 2 years, syncope at age of 34","previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"LQTS patient misdiagnosed as epilepsy, at age 34 a syncope led to an ECGw /prolonged QT but a normal response to exercise and an abnormal rate adaptive response of the QTc interval during exercise","sex":"Female","variant":[{"id":"cggv:c1a4b002-496e-48aa-806a-6304449327ae_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:157a2955-837c-47d2-b543-6c25a6f52828"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27868350","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"We present the case of a 66-year-old female with early onset deafness and seizures, who was diagnosed with epilepsy at the age of 2 years.

In this prospective study, we report biallelic mutations in KCNQ1 in Indian patients with LQT1 syndrome. Forty patients with a clinical diagnosis of LQT1 syndrome were referred for molecular testing. Of these, 18 were excluded from the analysis as they did not fulfill the inclusion criteria of broad T wave ECG pattern of the study. Direct sequencing of KCNQ1 was performed in 22 unrelated probands, parents and at-risk family members.

Five of 10 patients did not have deafness and were categorized as AR RWS, the rest being JLNS.

We applied a gene therapy approach in a mouse model of JLN syndrome (Kcnq1(-/-) mice) to prevent the development of deafness in the adult stage. A modified adeno-associated virus construct carrying a Kcnq1 expression cassette was injected postnatally (P0-P2) into the endolymph, which resulted in Kcnq1 expression in most cochlear marginal cells where native Kcnq1 is exclusively expressed. We also found that extensive ectopic virally mediated Kcnq1 transgene expression did not affect normal cochlear functions. Examination of cochlear morphology showed that the collapse of the Reissner's membrane and degeneration of hair cells (HCs) and cells in the spiral ganglia were corrected in Kcnq1(-/-) mice. Electrophysiological tests showed normal endocochlear potential in treated ears. In addition, auditory brainstem responses showed significant hearing preservation in the injected ears, ranging from 20 dB improvement to complete correction of the deafness phenotype. Our results demonstrate the first successful gene therapy treatment for gene defects specifically affecting the function of the stria vascularis, which is a major site affected by genetic mutations in inherited hearing loss.","dc:creator":"Chang Q","dc:date":"2015","dc:title":"Virally mediated Kcnq1 gene replacement therapy in the immature scala media restores hearing in a mouse model of human Jervell and Lange-Nielsen deafness syndrome."},"rdfs:label":"Cochlear expression of KCNQ1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:22365d77-6864-436c-a86f-0ebe549cd6a5","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7eb250d8-f623-4556-a40f-0fb254a6ce9e","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"USed RT PCR and in situ hybridization to identify KCNQ1 in the vestibular end organs as well as the heart and in a positive control.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11223304","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"The high [K(+)] in the inner ear endolymph is essential for mechanosensory transduction in hearing and balance. Several ion channels, including a slowly activating, voltage-dependent, outwardly conducting K(+) channel composed of the KCNQ1 (KvLQT1) and KCNE1 (IsK/minK) subunits, are expressed at the apical surface of vestibular dark cells. We investigated the underlying molecular mechanisms of this conductance using in situ hybridization, RT-PCR, and immunocytochemistry and by tracking the ultrastructural changes of vestibular structures in kcne1(-/-) mice. In the wild type mice, the KCNE1 and KCNQ1 proteins are expressed specifically at the apical membrane of dark cells, as early as gestational day (GD) 17 for KCNE1 while KCNQ1 mRNAs can be detected at GD 18. This is the first demonstration that the two protein components of this potassium channel co-localize in a polarized fashion at the cellular level. Although the vestibular end-organs are normal at birth in kcne1(-/-) mice, they begin to show modifications during postnatal development: we observed an increase in the height of the dark cells, in their number of mitochondria, and in basolateral membrane infoldings. Subsequently, the epithelium degenerates and the endolymphatic space collapses. Similar changes are known to occur in the cardio-auditory Jervell--Lange-Nielsen syndrome which is caused by mutations in the same channel.","dc:creator":"Nicolas M","dc:date":"2001","dc:title":"KCNQ1/KCNE1 potassium channels in mammalian vestibular dark cells."},"rdfs:label":"Immunocytochemistry KCNQ1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:1a5b2f7b-95df-4375-9976-760b75b882ac","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:619b6acf-0609-4bc1-8a27-b55d0f13f6ec","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"Conducted RNA analysis with RNA prepared fomr the hearts of 4 week old wild type, het, and knockout mice and found that there was reducted expression of KCNQ1 in hets and absent in knockouts.

KCNQ1 associates with a regulatory subunit, KCNE1, to produce the cardiac repolarizing current, I(Ks). Loss-of-function mutations in the human KCNQ1 gene have been linked to Jervell and Lange-Nielsen Syndrome (JLNS), a disorder characterized by profound bilateral deafness and a cardiac phenotype. To generate a mouse model for JLNS, we created a line of transgenic mice that have a targeted disruption in the Kcnq1 gene. Behavioral analysis revealed that the Kcnq1(-/-) mice are deaf and exhibit a shaker/waltzer phenotype. Histological analysis of the inner ear structures of Kcnq1(-/-) mice revealed gross morphological anomalies because of the drastic reduction in the volume of endolymph. ECGs recorded from Kcnq1(-/-) mice demonstrated abnormal T- and P-wave morphologies and prolongation of the QT and JT intervals when measured in vivo, but not in isolated hearts. These changes are indicative of cardiac repolarization defects that appear to be induced by extracardiac signals. Together, these data suggest that Kcnq1(-/-) mice are a potentially valuable animal model of JLNS.","dc:creator":"Casimiro MC","dc:date":"2001","dc:title":"Targeted disruption of the Kcnq1 gene produces a mouse model of Jervell and Lange-Nielsen Syndrome."},"rdfs:label":"KCNQ1 Heart expression in Mice"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:2cb5cd32-6663-48bc-b8b0-3b9ca34e2cb7_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:78746f26-2093-4a4f-a134-85b3f6fd5a26","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5bd27414-f9fb-4a72-a307-a59431c6a151","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:PhenotypeRescue"},"dc:description":"Conducted ABR testing and found that the varial constructs were able to rescue the hearing in the mice.

Variants in KCNQ1 were first reported in humans with this disease as early as 1997 (Neyroud et al., PMID 9020846). At least 11 unique variants (missense, in-frame indel, frameshift, large deletion, complex rearrangement, etc) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data knockout mouse models, rescue in mice, as well as expression of KCNQ1 in the heart and inner ear (PMIDs: 11226272, 11223304, 26084842, 9020846). The mechanism for disease is homozygous LOF of the KCNQ1 gene causes JLNS though  alterations have also been shown to cause Romano-Ward Syndrome in an AD manner (PMID: 29037160). Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 9 probands in 9 publications (PMIDs 29037160, 27041150, 9020846, 27868350, 25187895, 24206879). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 2 additional family members. In summary, KCNQ1 is definitively associated with Jervell and Lange-Nielsen Syndrome. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hearing Loss Working Group on 12/19/2017.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:2cb5cd32-6663-48bc-b8b0-3b9ca34e2cb7"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
