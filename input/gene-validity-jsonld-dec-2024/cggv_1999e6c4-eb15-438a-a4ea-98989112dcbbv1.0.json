We previously mapped a locus for a rare familial form of PD to chromosome 1p36 (PARK6). Here we show that mutations in PINK1 (PTEN-induced kinase 1) are associated with PARK6. We have identified two homozygous mutations affecting the PINK1 kinase domain in three consanguineous PARK6 families: a truncating nonsense mutation and a missense mutation at a highly conserved amino acid. Cell culture studies suggest that PINK1 is mitochondrially located and may exert a protective effect on the cell that is abrogated by the mutations, resulting in increased susceptibility to cellular stress. These data provide a direct molecular link between mitochondria and the pathogenesis of PD.","dc:creator":"Valente EM","dc:date":"2004","dc:title":"Hereditary early-onset Parkinson's disease caused by mutations in PINK1."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1999e6c4-eb15-438a-a4ea-98989112dcbb_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:697e8a7d-3d14-43f1-96db-65ed780e9979_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:697e8a7d-3d14-43f1-96db-65ed780e9979","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":28,"allele":{"id":"cggv:6898ae24-97e7-498f-9fa4-794d0176cb28","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_032409.3(PINK1):c.1570_1573dup (p.Asp525fs)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA252273"}},"detectionMethod":"For haplotype analysis, we typed short tandem repeat\n(STR) markers from the PARK2 ( parkin), PARK6 (PINK1),\nand PARK7 (DJ-1) regions, by polymerase chain reaction\n(PCR) using fluorescently labeled primers and an ABI3100\nautomatic DNA analyzer, according to conditions reported\npreviously.For the mutation analysis, the eight exons of the PINK1\ngene were amplified by PCR.","ethnicity":{"id":"cg:NotHispanicOrLatino"},"firstTestingMethod":"Homozygosity mapping","previousTesting":false,"secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:8d1e896a-4c86-4abc-86f9-3ef22f443076_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:6898ae24-97e7-498f-9fa4-794d0176cb28"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15349871","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Two homozygous mutations in the PINK1 gene, encoding a mitochondrial putative protein kinase, recently have been identified in families with PARK6-linked, autosomal recessive early-onset parkinsonism (AREP).

Mutations in the PTEN-induced kinase (PINK1) gene, in addition to those in parkin and DJ-1, have been found in families with recessive early-onset Parkinson's disease. We screened for parkin and PINK1 mutations in a panel of 177 autosomal recessive Parkinson's disease families with ages at onset < or =60 years, mostly from Europe. In 7 unrelated families, we identified 10 pathogenic PINK1 mutations (5 missense, 2 nonsense and 3 frameshift deletion mutations), 8 of which were novel. All the mutations were in the homozygous or compound heterozygous states. Interestingly, pseudo-dominant inheritance was observed in a family with two different mutations. The clinical characteristics of 12 PINK1 patients and 114 parkin patients were similar, even for signs such as dystonia at onset and increased reflexes, which were thought to be specific to parkin. In contrast, onset in patients with PINK1 mutations was earlier and increased reflexes were found more frequently than in patients without PINK1 or parkin mutations. These results suggest that PINK1 is the second most frequent causative gene in early-onset Parkinson's disease with a slowly progressive phenotype, indistinguishable from early-onset patients with parkin mutations.","dc:creator":"Ibáñez P","dc:date":"2006","dc:title":"Mutational analysis of the PINK1 gene in early-onset parkinsonism in Europe and North Africa."}},{"id":"cggv:31262811-cd88-4e72-8141-20cfb61d7bc9_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:90313e7b-af65-40a8-b5be-9d183a657c73"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16401616"}],"rdfs:label":"FPD-125-2"},{"id":"cggv:31262811-cd88-4e72-8141-20cfb61d7bc9","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:31262811-cd88-4e72-8141-20cfb61d7bc9_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:31262811-cd88-4e72-8141-20cfb61d7bc9_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"23303188"}],"strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:6920ea3c-bbb3-45ce-8d55-cf391a5c9978","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6920ea3c-bbb3-45ce-8d55-cf391a5c9978_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:6920ea3c-bbb3-45ce-8d55-cf391a5c9978_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"20508036, 21508222, 25226871, 22043288"}],"strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:72956a72-dc72-4330-9ea4-c68eb02822d6_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:72956a72-dc72-4330-9ea4-c68eb02822d6","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":27,"allele":{"id":"cggv:0de8d25e-851d-463b-8882-114659c5cf3b","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_032409.3(PINK1):c.1040T>C (p.Leu347Pro)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA252272"}},"detectionMethod":"Mutation analysis of PINK1 by direct sequencing of the polymerase chain reaction products.

Expression of human SOD1 suppresses neurodegeneration induced by dPINK1 inactivation. Moreover, treatment of dPINK1 RNAi flies with the antioxidants SOD and vitamin E significantly inhibits ommatidial degeneration.

Furthermore, transmission electron microscopy analysis and a rescue experiment with Drosophila Bcl-2 demonstrated that mitochondrial dysfunction accounts for the degenerative changes in all phenotypes of PINK1 mutants.

Transgenic expression of Parkin markedly ameliorated all PINK1 loss-of-function phenotypes, but not vice versa, suggesting that Parkin functions downstream of PINK1.

Parkinson´s disease is a progressive degenerative disorder of the central nervous system characterized by loss of dopamine-producing neurons in the substantia nigra. Signs and symptoms include tremor, which is most pronounced during rest, muscle rigidity, slowing of voluntary movements (bradykinesia), and a tendency to fall back (postural instability). Many pathogenic variants in the biallelic state have been reported in PINK1 in about 200 patients by different authors/groups from different ethnicities (Kasten et al. 2018, PMID: 29644727, www.mdsgene.org). The mutational spectrum is broad, including nonsense, frameshift, splice site, missense changes, and also structural variants (e.g. exon deletions). Fifteen families from five publications are included in this curation, covering patients with biallelic missense or truncating variants. The additional evidence from the literature was not included in this curation because the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The disease follows a recessive mode of inheritance with seemingly full, age-dependent penetrance. Notably, there is an ongoing debate on the potential role of heterozygous variants as genetic risk factors for Parkinson´s disease (Klein et al. 2007, PMID: 17582365; Hu et al. 2022, PMID: 36305379). The gene-disease association is also supported by recurrent experimental evidence, including animal models and in-vitro functional assays. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be a loss-of-function (LOF) indicated by the many truncating variants and further supported by knock-out fly models (Park et al. 2006, PMID: 16672980; Wang et al. 2006, PMID: 16938835). There is a well-defined functional interaction with another autosomal-recessive Parkinson´s disease-linked gene, i.e. PRKN encoding Parkin. While Parkin functions as an E3-ubiquiting ligase for mitochondrial proteins, PINK1 serves as a sensor for disrupted mitochondria (Narendra et al. 2010, PMID: 20126261; Rakovic et al. 2010, PMID: 20508036). It has further repeatedly been shown that several of the PINK1 missense variants impair proper mitophagy (e.g. Kawajiri et al. 2010, PMID: 20153330; Ando et al. 2017, PMID: 28438176). In summary, biallelic, pathogenic variants in PINK1 are definitively causing autosomal-recessive Parkinson´s disease. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:1999e6c4-eb15-438a-a4ea-98989112dcbb"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
