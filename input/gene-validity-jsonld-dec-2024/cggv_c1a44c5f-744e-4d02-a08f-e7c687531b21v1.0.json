To understand the molecular basis of the jimpy mutation, we have examined the expression of mRNAs encoding myelin proteolipid protein (PLP). PLP mRNAs were detectable in jimpy brain RNA at 21 days after birth but were severely reduced in abundance compared to wild-type littermates. Nucleotide sequence analysis of cDNA clones for PLP mRNA, isolated from a cDNA library of jimpy brain poly(A)+ RNA, revealed that the PLP mRNA expressed in jimpy contained a deletion of 74 nucleotides with respect to the wild-type sequence. This deletion causes a frameshift in the open reading frame resulting in an altered carboxyl terminus for jimpy PLP. Probes specific for the deleted sequence, however, hybridize with equal efficiency to genomic DNA from jimpy and wild-type littermates, suggesting that the defect in the jimpy PLP mRNA is generated by aberrant RNA processing rather than by deletion of genomic sequences.

The canine shaking pup carries such a mutation, a single base change that substitutes a proline for a histidine near the first transmembrane region of PLP and DM-20. This mutation hinders oligodendrocyte differentiation, as evidence by a splicing pattern at the PLP locus characteristic of immature oligodendrocytes. The spliced transcript expressed earliest in development, DM-20, continues to be overexpressed in shaking pup oligodendrocytes. The disruption of the normal maturation schedule in these X-linked dysmyelinating disorders suggests that PLP or DM-20 plays a fundamental role in oligodendrocyte development.

Patients with PLP mutations presented a large range of disease severity, with a continuum between severe forms of PMD, without motor development, to pure forms of SPG. Clinical severity was found to be correlated with the nature of the mutation, suggesting a distinct strategy for detection of PLP point mutations between severe PMD, mild PMD and SPG. Single amino-acid changes in highly conserved regions of the DM20 protein caused the most severe forms of PMD. Substitutions of less conserved amino acids, truncations, absence of the protein and PLP-specific mutations caused the milder forms of PMD and SPG.

Historically, Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease has encompassed a host of neurologic disorders that present with a deficit of myelin, the membrane elaborated by glial cells that encircles and successively enwraps axons. We describe here a Pelizaeus-Merzbacher pedigree of the classical type, with X-linked inheritance, a typical clinical progression, and a pathologic loss of myelinating cells and myelin in the central nervous system. To discriminate variants of Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease, a set of oligonucleotide primers was constructed to polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) amplify and sequence the gene encoding proteolipid protein (PLP), a structural protein that comprises half of the protein of the myelin sheath. The PLP gene in one of two affected males and the carrier mother of this family exhibited a single base difference in the more than 2 kb of the PLP gene sequenced, a C----T transition that would create a serine substitution for proline at the carboxy end of the protein. Our results delineate the clinical features of Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease, define the possible molecular pathology of this dysmyelinating disorder, and address the molecular classification of inborn errors of myelin metabolism. Patients with the classical form (type I) and the more severely affected, connatal variant of Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (type II) would be predicted to display mutation at the PLP locus. The other variants (types III-VI), which have sometimes been categorized as Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease, may represent mutations in genes encoding other structural myelin proteins or proteins critical to myelination.","dc:creator":"Gencic S","dc:date":"1989","dc:title":"Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease: an X-linked neurologic disorder of myelin metabolism with a novel mutation in the gene encoding proteolipid protein."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2773936","rdfs:label":"Gencic PM4 (GM9545)"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.25,"dc:description":"This particular publication shows no evidence for gene impact, though in silico prediction tools predict a damaging effect, and the variant is not present in gnomAD."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalDominantOtherVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":3.25},{"id":"cggv:c1a44c5f-744e-4d02-a08f-e7c687531b21_ad_null_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f7d491c7-7e19-4450-91a5-ab1efa92eee5_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d58d21da-6fd0-4900-a0f7-25251ec9e7cb","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":9,"firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"Classic Pelizaeus Merzbacher phenotype; early-onset, subclinical demyelinating neuropathy; diffuse white matter hyperintensity; developmental delay; severe spastic quadriparesis","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:f7d491c7-7e19-4450-91a5-ab1efa92eee5_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:654a885f-a2cd-407e-b8c9-87dd519f1d6a","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NC_000023.11:g.103788511G>A (GRCh38)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA414104455"}},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23771846","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease is a severe X-linked disorder of central myelination caused by mutations affecting the proteolipid protein gene.

Evidence suggests that these disorders are at different ends of the same clinical spectrum; the curation presented here is specifically for the more severe Pelizaeus Merzbacher presentation.  The PLP1 gene encodes for 2 major alternatively spliced transcripts: a full length transcript that encodes PLP, and a transcript lacking the PLP specific domain in exon 3, known as DM20. Differing molecular mechanisms are known to cause these disorders, including overexpression of PLP/DM20 (commonly caused by large, multi-gene duplications including PLP1 and resulting in \"classic\" PMD); missense variants resulting in misfolding of both PLP and DM20 (resulting in the more severe, \"connatal\" PMD); null variants (resulting in milder presentations of PMD or \"complicated\" SPG); and milder misfolding variants (often associated with the SPG phenotype).  Note that though duplications are the most common mechanism of PMD, none are curated here (as most involve more genes than just PLP1).  Though extensive functional evidence (including additional animal models) is available to support the link between PLP1 and PMD, only a subset is presented here.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:c1a44c5f-744e-4d02-a08f-e7c687531b21"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
