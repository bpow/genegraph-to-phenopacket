Galactose mutarotase catalyzes the mutarotation of both galactose (beta-D-galactose to alpha-D-galactose) and glucose. Galactosemia 4 was discovered in 2018 after searching for the cause of elevated galactose discovered in newborn screens that couldn’t be explained by mutations in *GALT, GALK1, or GALE*. Galactosemia 4 manifests with similar symptoms to type II galactosemia (*GALK1* deficiency), i.e. early onset cataracts. Cataracts sometimes resolve with early intervention while other times require surgery.  Other symptoms such as transient cholestasis, neonatal jaundice, and a portosystemic shunt that spontaneously regressed have been seen. Importantly, neurological complications including speech disorders, ataxia, and intellectual disability have not been observed. Also, the complication of primary ovarian insufficiency has not been reported, although little data is currently available for *GALM*-deficiency in adults. Because this disease is typically identified through neonatal screening in programs that directly measure galactose (the biochemical phenotype is elevated blood galactose and detection of galactose-1-phosphate) the infant is usually put on a galactose free diet which results in normalization of blood galactose and galactose-1-phosphate levels. For this reason, the implications of this disease (without treatment) later in life are not known. Also, newborn screening programs that measure *GALT* activity and not galactose could miss a *GALM* deficiency.\n\nSummary of Case Level Data (12 points): 8 probands were scored with 5 unique variants (two nonsense, one frameshift, and two missense variants).\n\nSummary of Experimental Evidence (0.5 points): This gene disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence of the *GALM* enzymatic reaction sequence.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:21ee674a-b133-46e5-be96-d3533bc6ed61"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
