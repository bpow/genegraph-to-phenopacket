Recent experiments by others using plasminogen-deficient mice revealed the importance of plasmin, the active form of plasminogen, for the maintenance of the normal cornea and for corneal wound healing [Kao, Kao, Bugge, Kaufman, Kombrinck, Converse, Good and Degan (1998) Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 39, 502-508; Drew, Kaufman, Kombrinck, Danton, Daugherty, Degen and Bugge (1998) Blood 91, 1616-1624]. In the present experiments, plasmin was identified as a major serine proteinase in the human cornea. The major plasminogen and plasmin forms on non-reducing zymograms and Western blots had Mr values of 76x10(3) and 85x10(3), with minor forms of Mr 200x10(3), 135x10(3), 68x10(3) and 45x10(3). Angiostatin-like peptides with Mrs of 48x10(3), 45x10(3) and 38x10(3) were observed which bound to lysine-Sepharose and reacted with anti-plasminogen monoclonal antibodies directed towards kringle domains 1-3 of plasminogen. The cornea contained 1.1+/-0.15 microgram of plasminogen+plasmin/cornea, or 0.54+/-0.05 microgram of plasminogen+plasmin/mg of protein. Cornea conditioned medium contained nine times the amount of plasminogen+plasmin that could be extracted from the cornea. These data suggested that corneal cells, unlike most extrahepatic cells, synthesize plasminogen. The synthesis of plasminogen by the cornea was confirmed by immunoprecipitation of metabolically labelled plasminogen, sequencing of its cDNA obtained by reverse transcriptase-PCR and inhibition of protein synthesis. Interleukins-1alpha and -1beta stimulated corneal plasminogen synthesis 2-3-fold; however, interleukin-6 decreased corneal plasminogen synthesis by approx. 40% at early times after addition of the cytokine. By 24 h of culture, no differences were noted in the presence and absence of interleukin-6. Thus the cornea can synthesize plasminogen and regulate its synthesis in response to its environment, including cytokines induced in the cornea by injury and inflammation. Therefore the cornea can control the amount of plasminogen, the precursor of both plasmin and angiostatin.","dc:creator":"Twining SS","dc:date":"1999","dc:title":"Extrahepatic synthesis of plasminogen in the human cornea is up-regulated by interleukins-1alpha and -1beta."},"rdfs:label":"Twining_Expression in cornea"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"The evidence suggests that the cornea, which is predominantly affected in plasminogen-deficient patients, is an extra-hepatic site of plasminogen synthesis.

PLG was reported in relation to Hypoplasminogenemia as early as 1997 (Schuster et al, 1997, PMID: 9242524; Murata, 1997, PMID: 9375744). At least 11 unique variants including nonsense, splice site, frameshift and missense have been reported in humans. PLG encodes plasminogen, which is secreted as a zymogen and is activated by proteolysis and converted to plasmin and angiostatin. Plasmin is involved in fibrinolysis. Hypoplasminogenemia or congenital plasminogen deficiency is characterized by chronic pseudomembranous lesions consisting of fibrin deposition and inflammation, with ligneous conjunctivitis being the predominant clinical feature (PMID: 12850227). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data.  \n  \nSummary of Case Level Data (12 Points):\nVariants in this gene have been reported in at least 10 probands in 7 publications (PMID: 9834305, 9242524, 10233898, 9375744, 16849641, 9255907, 11477736). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts) has been reached. \n  \nThe mechanism for disease is expected to be biallelic loss of function.  \t \n  \nSummary of Experimental Data (4.5 points): \nThis gene-disease association is supported by mouse models and in vitro functional assays. The PLG knock-out mouse generated by Bugge et al, (PMID: 7705657) has been shown to recapitulate ligneous conjunctivitis (PMID: 9473227). Plasminogen is involved in fibrinolysis, and the loss of the activity due to PLG variants results in abnormal fibrin deposition in tissues, as observed in individuals with plasminogen deficiency (PMID: 9501859). Plasminogen is largely synthesized in the liver, with expression limited to liver and kidney; however, plasminogen is also shown to be synthesized by the corneal epithelium (PMID: 10215610). Therapeutic administration of Glu-Plasminogen is shown to improve symptoms in individuals with PLG variants and plasminogen deficiency (PMID: 29321155).  \n\nIn summary, PLG is definitively associated with Autosomal Recessive Hypoplasminogenemia. \nThis has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.
