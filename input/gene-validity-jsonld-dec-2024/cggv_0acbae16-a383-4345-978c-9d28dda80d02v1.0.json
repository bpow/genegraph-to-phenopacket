In this study, we ascertained a consanguineous Pakistani family with ARMR in four living individuals from three branches of the family, plus an additional affected individual later identified as a phenocopy. Retinitis pigmentosa was present in affected individuals, but no other features suggestive of a syndromic form of MR were found. We used Affymetrix 500K microarrays to perform homozygosity mapping and identified a homozygous and haploidentical region of 11.2 Mb on chromosome 4p15.33-p15.2. Linkage analysis across this region produced a maximum two-point LOD score of 3.59. We sequenced genes within the critical region and identified a homozygous splice-site mutation segregating in the family, within a coiled-coil and C2 domain-containing gene, CC2D2A. This mutation leads to the skipping of exon 19, resulting in a frameshift and a truncated protein lacking the C2 domain. Conservation analysis for CC2D2A suggests a functional domain near the C terminus as well as the C2 domain. Preliminary functional studies of CC2D2A suggest a possible role in Ca(2+)-dependent signal transduction. Identifying the function of CC2D2A, and a possible common pathway with CC2D1A, in correct neuronal development and functioning may help identify possible therapeutic targets for MR.","dc:creator":"Noor A","dc:date":"2008","dc:title":"CC2D2A, encoding a coiled-coil and C2 domain protein, causes autosomal-recessive mental retardation with retinitis pigmentosa."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0acbae16-a383-4345-978c-9d28dda80d02_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3d21dea9-3e63-46dc-9678-119df15f9e3a_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3d21dea9-3e63-46dc-9678-119df15f9e3a","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"WeeksGestation","ageValue":17,"allele":{"id":"cggv:c9029eb2-cca5-459d-9643-757d01f81e99","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001378615.1(CC2D2A):c.517C>T (p.Arg173Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA144239"}},"detectionMethod":"DNA sequencing of CC2D2A from PCR-amplified patient DNA","firstTestingMethod":"Homozygosity mapping","phenotypeFreeText":"Cystic kidneys characteristic of Meckel syndrome","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0002085","obo:HP_0000107","obo:HP_0001408","obo:HP_0002419","obo:HP_0000175"],"previousTesting":false,"secondTestingMethod":"Genotyping","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:59979e54-56c8-4506-b8c5-57b60a91715c_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:c9029eb2-cca5-459d-9643-757d01f81e99"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19777577","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Meckel-Gruber syndrome (MKS) is a lethal fetal disorder characterized by diffuse renal cystic dysplasia, polydactyly, a brain malformation that is usually occipital encephalocele, and/or vermian agenesis, with intrahepatic biliary duct proliferation. Joubert syndrome (JBS) is a viable neurological disorder with a characteristic \"molar tooth sign\" (MTS) on axial images reflecting cerebellar vermian hypoplasia/dysplasia. Both conditions are classified as ciliopathies with an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. Allelism of MKS and JBS has been reported for TMEM67/MKS3, CEP290/MKS4, and RPGRIP1L/MKS5. Recently, one homozygous splice mutation with a founder effect was reported in the CC2D2A gene in Finnish fetuses with MKS, defining the 6th locus for MKS. Shortly thereafter, CC2D2A mutations were also reported in JBS. The analysis of the CC2D2A gene in our series of MKS fetuses, identified 14 novel truncating mutations in 11 cases. These results confirm the involvement of CC2D2A in MKS and reveal a major contribution of CC2D2A to the disease. We also identified three missense CC2D2A mutations in two JBS cases. Therefore, and in accordance with the data reported regarding RPGRIP1L, our results indicate phenotype-genotype correlations, as missense and presumably hypomorphic mutations lead to JBS while all null alleles lead to MKS.","dc:creator":"Mougou-Zerelli S","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"CC2D2A mutations in Meckel and Joubert syndromes indicate a genotype-phenotype

syndrome and related disorders (JSRD) are primarily autosomal-recessive conditions characterized by hypotonia, ataxia, abnormal eye movements, and intellectual disability with a distinctive mid-hindbrain malformation. Variable features include retinal dystrophy, cystic kidney disease, and liver fibrosis. JSRD are included in the rapidly expanding group of disorders called ciliopathies, because all six gene products implicated in JSRD (NPHP1, AHI1, CEP290, RPGRIP1L, TMEM67, and ARL13B) function in the primary cilium/basal body organelle. By using homozygosity mapping in consanguineous families, we identify loss-of-function mutations in CC2D2A in JSRD patients with and without retinal, kidney, and liver disease. CC2D2A is expressed in all fetal and adult tissues tested. In ciliated cells, we observe localization of recombinant CC2D2A at the basal body and colocalization with CEP290, whose cognate gene is mutated in multiple hereditary ciliopathies. In addition, the proteins can physically interact in vitro, as shown by yeast two-hybrid and GST pull-down experiments. A nonsense mutation in the zebrafish CC2D2A ortholog (sentinel) results in pronephric cysts, a hallmark of ciliary dysfunction analogous to human cystic kidney disease. Knockdown of cep290 function in sentinel fish results in a synergistic pronephric cyst phenotype, revealing a genetic interaction between CC2D2A and CEP290 and implicating CC2D2A in cilium/basal body function. These observations extend the genetic spectrum of JSRD and provide a model system for studying extragenic modifiers in JSRD and other ciliopathies.","dc:creator":"Gorden

syndrome (MKS) is a lethal malformation disorder characterized classically by encephalocele, polycystic kidneys, and polydactyly. MKS is also one of the major contributors to syndromic neural tube defects (NTDs). Recent findings have shown primary cilia dysfunction in the molecular background of MKS, indicating that cilia are critical for early human development. However, even though four genes behind MKS have been identified to date, they elucidate only a minor proportion of the MKS cases. In this study, instead of traditional linkage analysis, we selected 10 nonrelated affected fetuses and looked for the homozygous regions shared by them. Based on this strategy, we identified the sixth locus and the fifth gene, CC2D2A (MKS6), behind MKS. The biological function of CC2D2A is uncharacterized, but the corresponding polypeptide is predicted to be involved in ciliary functions and it has a calcium binding domain (C2). Immunofluorescence staining of patient's fibroblast cells demonstrates that the cells lack cilia, providing evidence for the critical role of CC2D2A in cilia formation. Our finding is very significant not only to understand the molecular background of MKS, but also to obtain additional information about the function of the cilia, which can help to understand their significance in normal development and also in other ciliopathies, which are an increasing group of disorders with overlapping phenotypes.","dc:creator":"Tallila J","dc:date":"2008","dc:title":"Identification of CC2D2A as a Meckel syndrome gene adds an important piece to the ciliopathy puzzle."}},"rdfs:label":"Case 1"},{"id":"cggv:6d2fbe3a-8542-4645-856b-b14eab97e480","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6d2fbe3a-8542-4645-856b-b14eab97e480_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12},{"id":"cggv:0acbae16-a383-4345-978c-9d28dda80d02_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0acbae16-a383-4345-978c-9d28dda80d02_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3124ed1f-d190-4c01-836a-63aafe0bdf91","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:dc1853aa-da51-474f-82b0-26fb190c13ee","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"RT-PCR analysis of CC2D2A in adult and fetal tissues showed expression in all tissues analyzed.

Here we describe the retinal phenotype of cc2d2a mutant zebrafish consisting of disorganized rod and cone photoreceptor outer segments resulting in abnormal visual function as measured by electroretinogram. Our analysis reveals trafficking defects in mutant photoreceptors affecting transmembrane outer segment proteins (opsins) and striking accumulation of vesicles, suggesting a role for Cc2d2a in vesicle trafficking and fusion. This is further supported by mislocalization of Rab8, a key regulator of opsin carrier vesicle trafficking, in cc2d2a mutant photoreceptors and by enhancement of the cc2d2a retinal and kidney phenotypes with partial knockdown of rab8. We demonstrate that Cc2d2a localizes to the connecting cilium in photoreceptors and to the transition zone in other ciliated cell types and that cilia are present in these cells in cc2d2a mutants, arguing against a primary function for Cc2d2a in ciliogenesis.

Per the criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found no difference in molecular mechanism and inheritance pattern. While these disease entities represent a wide range of clinical severity, the molecular mechanism is loss of function, and all disease entities have autosomal-recessive inheritance. Therefore, the above disease entities have been lumped into one disease entity, ciliopathy (MONDO:0005308). \n\nPathogenic variants in *CC2D2A* were curated from nine affected probands with *CC2D2A*-ciliopathies from five different publications (PMID:18387594; PMID:18950740, PMID:18513680, PMID:19777577, PMID:19574260). Five of the curated probands were characterized by Joubert syndrome 9 (OMIM:612285) or COACH syndrome 2 (OMIM:61911); and four of the affected probands had Meckel syndrome 6 (OMIM:612284). Eight predicted protein-truncating variants and three missense variants were curated for a total of eleven unique variants. There are many more cases and variants described in detail in the literature (PMID:33486889), but the maximum of 12 points was reached. The mechanism of disease in all curated cases is homozygous or compound-heterozygous loss of function (PMID:18950740).  \n\nIn ciliopathy-causing genes, disruption to ciliary biogenesis is an established disease mechanism. CC2D2A localizes to the ciliary transition zone and plays a critical role in cilia formation, an established molecular function for known ciliopathy-causing gene products (PMID:24947469). CC2D2A physically interacts and co-localizes with CEP290, the protein product of a gene known to cause multiple hereditary ciliopathies with similar organ involvement and pleiotropy (OMIM:610142). In fibroblasts derived from a patient with Meckel syndrome (homozygous *CC2D2A* p.Gln588Ter), cilia were notably absent (PMID:18513680). The *Cc2d2a* knockout mouse model is embryonically lethal and demonstrates pleiotropic organogenesis defects that recapitulate the Meckel syndrome phenotype in humans (PMID:21725307; PMID:24947469). Cilia are absent from many tissues, including the embryonic node, perinatal kidney tubules, and the developing neural tube, where Shh signaling is consequently disrupted. (PMID:24947469). Primary cilium biogenesis defects observed in *Cc2d2a* loss-of-function mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) are consistent with the disease mechanism in humans, where loss and/or abnormal cilia morphology have been observed (PMID:24947469).  \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between *CC2D2A* and autosomal recessive ciliopathy-*CC2D2A*. The molecular mechanism is loss of function, leading to defects in ciliary formation and function.
