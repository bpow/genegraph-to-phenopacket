Lipid droplets were found in five of these six families, suggesting a diagnosis of CDS. Four additional families selected on the basis of a confirmed diagnosis of CDS also showed linkage to the NCIE2 locus. Linkage-disequilibrium analysis of these families, all from the Mediterranean basin, allowed us to refine the NCIE2 locus to an approximately 1.3-Mb region. Candidate genes from the interval were screened, and eight distinct mutations in the recently identified CGI-58 gene were found in 13 patients from these nine families. The spectrum of gene variants included insertion, deletion, splice-site, and point mutations. The CGI-58 protein belongs to a large family of proteins characterized by an alpha/beta hydrolase fold. CGI-58 contains three sequence motifs that correspond to a catalytic triad found in the esterase/lipase/thioesterase subfamily. Interestingly, CGI-58 differs from other members of the esterase/lipase/thioesterase subfamily in that its putative catalytic triad contains an asparagine in place of the usual serine residue.","dc:creator":"Lefèvre C","dc:date":"2001","dc:title":"Mutations in CGI-58, the gene encoding a new protein of the esterase/lipase/thioesterase subfamily, in Chanarin-Dorfman syndrome."}},"rdfs:label":"Patient B6"},{"id":"cggv:cd6211ce-64ec-4356-9d71-089132faf2d2","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:cd6211ce-64ec-4356-9d71-089132faf2d2_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:cd6211ce-64ec-4356-9d71-089132faf2d2_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"PMID: 15136565: in 3T3-L1 cells, introduction of the c.389A>C (p.Gln130Pro) variant resulted in abnormal cellular localization away from lipid droplets and toward a diffuse cytoplasmic distribution and did not interact with perilipin or colocalize with perilipin on lipid droplets "}],"strengthScore":0.25,"dc:description":"Scored 0.25pts/variant to yield 0.5pts total, and thereby prevent double-counting for homozygous variant"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:c6999347-2ccd-4ef8-8a1e-cf675716c13e_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c6999347-2ccd-4ef8-8a1e-cf675716c13e","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:9e384db5-4c86-4bac-9174-70ee7e5812d2","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NC_000003.12:g.43711708G>A (GRCh38)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA2341366"}},"detectionMethod":"PCR and Sanger sequencing of ABHD5 gene","firstTestingMethod":"PCR","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:5d67e40d-0a65-413c-9330-2dfcf80b56e5_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:9e384db5-4c86-4bac-9174-70ee7e5812d2"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18339307"},"rdfs:label":"Patient 3"},{"id":"cggv:5d67e40d-0a65-413c-9330-2dfcf80b56e5","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5d67e40d-0a65-413c-9330-2dfcf80b56e5_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.75,"dc:description":"Scored 0.75 pts/variant to yield 1.5pts total and avoid double-counting for homozygous variant"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:e5d9eeb6-feee-4ca3-b8e4-3467076027d1_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e5d9eeb6-feee-4ca3-b8e4-3467076027d1","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:b0d37694-2d4f-4ba1-b06e-e0e36fddf595","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_016006.6(ABHD5):c.594dup (p.Arg199fs)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA117426"}},"detectionMethod":"PCR and Sanger sequencing of ABHD5 gene","firstTestingMethod":"PCR","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:86a980d7-58b2-4d7e-b95a-5e1274e7b453_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:b0d37694-2d4f-4ba1-b06e-e0e36fddf595"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25682902","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Chanarin-Dorfman syndrome is an autosomal recessive lipid storage disease characterized by non-bullous congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma, and involvement of the liver, muscles and central nervous system due to a multisystemic accumulation of neutral lipids in various types of cells.

CGI-58 interacts with ATGL, stimulating its TG hydrolase activity up to 20-fold. Alleles of CGI-58 carrying point mutations associated with CDS fail to activate ATGL. Moreover, CGI-58/ATGL coexpression attenuates lipid accumulation in COS-7 cells. Antisense RNA-mediated reduction of CGI-58 expression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes inhibits TG mobilization. Finally, expression of functional CGI-58 in CDS fibroblasts restores lipolysis and reverses the abnormal TG accumulation typical for CDS. These data establish an important biochemical function for CGI-58 in the lipolytic degradation of fat, implicating this lipolysis activator in the pathogenesis of CDS.","dc:creator":"Lass A","dc:date":"2006","dc:title":"Adipose triglyceride lipase-mediated lipolysis of cellular fat stores is activated by CGI-58 and defective in Chanarin-Dorfman Syndrome."},"rdfs:label":"ABHD5 interacts with ATGL (PNPLA2)"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:9a4cbadf-c178-4bad-b97f-8b3d8057fa23","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d2ad766f-7523-4a15-a9e7-958e7cd14cc7","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"},"dc:description":"ABHD5 encodes an acyltransferase that is involved in the synthesis of phosphatidic acid via acylating lysophosphatidic acid to phosphatidic acid, the major intermediate in membrane and storage lipid biosynthesis, and also functions as a coactivator of adipocyte triglyceride lipase to help regulate triacylglycerol homeostasis in adipocytes (PMID: 18606822)\nAs reviewed in PMID: 33455044, patients with Channing-Dorfman syndrome (CDS) show impaired ABHD5-mediated lipolysis due to impaired activation of PNPLA2 (PMID: 16679289), resulting in the characteric disease manifestation of triacylglycerol accumulation in multiple tissues.

We have earlier reported that YLR099c encoding Ict1p in Saccharomyces cerevisiae can acylate lysophosphatidic acid to phosphatidic acid. Here we report that human CGI-58 is closely related to ICT1. To understand the biochemical function of cgi-58, the gene was overexpressed in Escherichia coli, and the purified recombinant protein was found to specifically acylate lysophosphatidic acid in an acyl-CoA-dependent manner. Overexpression of CGI-58 in S. cerevisiae showed an increase in the formation of phosphatidic acid resulting in an overall increase in the total phospholipids. However, the triacylglycerol level was found to be significantly reduced. In addition, the physiological significance of cgi-58 in mice white adipose tissue was studied. We found soluble lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase activity in mouse white adipose tissue. Immunoblot analysis using anti-Ict1p antibodies followed by mass spectrometry of the immunocross-reactive protein in lipid droplets revealed its identity as cgi-58. These observations suggest the existence of an alternate cytosolic phosphatidic acid biosynthetic pathway in the white adipose tissue.

Activation of ATGL initiates the hydrolytic catabolism of cellular triacylglycerol (TG) stores to glycerol and nonesterified fatty acids. Mutations in both ATGL and CGI-58 cause \"neutral lipid storage disease\" characterized by massive accumulation of TG in various tissues. The analysis of CGI-58-deficient (Cgi-58(-/-)) mice, presented in this study, reveals a dual function of CGI-58 in lipid metabolism. First, systemic TG accumulation and severe hepatic steatosis in newborn Cgi-58(-/-) mice establish a limiting role for CGI-58 in ATGL-mediated TG hydrolysis and supply of nonesterified fatty acids as energy substrate. Second, a severe skin permeability barrier defect uncovers an essential ATGL-independent role of CGI-58 in skin lipid metabolism. The neonatal lethal skin barrier defect is linked to an impaired hydrolysis of epidermal TG. As a consequence, sequestration of fatty acids in TG prevents the synthesis of acylceramides, which are essential lipid precursors for the formation of a functional skin permeability barrier.

In Caenorhabditis elegans, fasting induces various physiological changes, including a dramatic decrease in lipid contents through lipolysis. Interestingly, C. elegans lacks perilipin family genes which play a crucial role in the regulation of lipid homeostasis in other species. Here, we demonstrate that in the intestinal cells of C. elegans, a newly identified protein, lipid droplet protein 1 (C25A1.12; LID-1), modulates lipolysis by binding to adipose triglyceride lipase 1 (C05D11.7; ATGL-1) during nutritional deprivation. In fasted worms, lipid droplets were decreased in intestinal cells, whereas suppression of ATGL-1 via RNA interference (RNAi) resulted in retention of stored lipid droplets. Overexpression of ATGL-1 markedly decreased lipid droplets, whereas depletion of LID-1 via RNAi prevented the effect of overexpressed ATGL-1 on lipolysis. In adult worms, short-term fasting increased cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels, which activated protein kinase A (PKA) to stimulate lipolysis via ATGL-1 and LID-1. Moreover, ATGL-1 protein stability and LID-1 binding were augmented by PKA activation, eventually leading to increased lipolysis.
