Localization was seen in the ciliary basal body and daughter centriole. There was also ARMC9 co-localization with γ-tubulin in the basal body and daughter centriole.Expression was also noted to be upregulated in ciliated cells by quantitative PCR in human fibroblasts. This is consitent with previous works concluding that ciliary genes are upregulated during ciliogenesis and maintain upregulation in ciliated cells.

It is defined by a distinctive brain malformation known as the \"molar tooth sign\" on axial MRI. Subsets of affected individuals have malformations such as coloboma, polydactyly, and encephalocele, as well as progressive retinal dystrophy, fibrocystic kidney disease, and liver fibrosis. More than 35 genes have been associated with JS, but in a subset of families the genetic cause remains unknown. All of the gene products localize in and around the primary cilium, making JS a canonical ciliopathy. Ciliopathies are unified by their overlapping clinical features and underlying mechanisms involving ciliary dysfunction. In this work, we identify biallelic rare, predicted-deleterious ARMC9 variants (stop-gain, missense, splice-site, and single-exon deletion) in 11 individuals with JS from 8 families, accounting for approximately 1% of the disorder. The associated phenotypes range from isolated neurological involvement to JS with retinal dystrophy, additional brain abnormalities (e.g., heterotopia, Dandy-Walker malformation), pituitary insufficiency, and/or synpolydactyly. We show that ARMC9 localizes to the basal body of the cilium and is upregulated during ciliogenesis. Typical ciliopathy phenotypes (curved body shape, retinal dystrophy, coloboma, and decreased cilia) in a CRISPR/Cas9-engineered zebrafish mutant model provide additional support for ARMC9 as a ciliopathy-associated gene. Identifying ARMC9 mutations as a cause of JS takes us one step closer to a full genetic understanding of this important disorder and enables future functional work to define the central biological mechanisms underlying JS and other ciliopathies.","dc:creator":"Van De Weghe JC","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Mutations in ARMC9, which Encodes a Basal Body Protein, Cause Joubert Syndrome in Humans and Ciliopathy Phenotypes in Zebrafish."},"rdfs:label":"ARMC9 Localizes to the Basal Bodies of Primary Cilia"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:fbf82098-3bc2-4058-b4cc-dc2f58116a79","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b1d0d662-d192-4e5e-80d9-526a8a74bd13","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"In situ hybridization of zebrafish armc9 revealed expression of armc9 in the brain, specifically in the cerebellum and periventricular regions, as well as in the retina","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28625504","rdfs:label":"zebrafish armc9 in situ hybridization"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:77d8b454-195d-463c-b043-fc068392a23b_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:568a53ee-f285-4dbb-94d6-c85ce276d288","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:78511a4d-9be5-4aa6-8d66-56619fb0d65f","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"All mutant cell lines had shortened cilia length compared to controls\n","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32453716","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Joubert syndrome (JBTS) is a recessive neurodevelopmental ciliopathy characterized by a pathognomonic hindbrain malformation. All known JBTS genes encode proteins involved in the structure or function of primary cilia, ubiquitous antenna-like organelles essential for cellular signal transduction. Here, we used the recently identified JBTS-associated protein armadillo repeat motif-containing 9 (ARMC9) in tandem-affinity purification and yeast 2-hybrid screens to identify a ciliary module whose dysfunction underlies JBTS. In addition to the known JBTS-associated proteins CEP104 and CSPP1, we identified coiled-coil domain containing 66 (CCDC66) and TOG array regulator of axonemal microtubules 1 (TOGARAM1) as ARMC9 interaction partners. We found that TOGARAM1 variants cause JBTS and disrupt TOGARAM1 interaction with ARMC9. Using a combination of protein interaction analyses, characterization of patient-derived fibroblasts, and analysis of CRISPR/Cas9-engineered zebrafish and hTERT-RPE1 cells, we demonstrated that dysfunction of ARMC9 or TOGARAM1 resulted in short cilia with decreased axonemal acetylation and polyglutamylation, but relatively intact transition zone function. Aberrant serum-induced ciliary resorption and cold-induced depolymerization in ARMC9 and TOGARAM1 patient cell lines suggest a role for this new JBTS-associated protein module in ciliary stability.","dc:creator":"Latour BL","dc:date":"2020","dc:title":"Dysfunction of the ciliary ARMC9/TOGARAM1 protein module causes Joubert syndrome."},"rdfs:label":"Altered cilia length"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:77d8b454-195d-463c-b043-fc068392a23b_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:62ee8e10-b637-4413-bd81-17108c0ccda8","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d55dd5f3-8e22-4355-92c2-db4ef7d2584d","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"armc9 expressed in CNS regions (cerebellum, periventricular regions, and retina), body curvature corresponded with indels in the targeted exons.

The analysis revealed a novel synonymous variation p.T293T (c.879G>A) which leads to a splicing defect in ARMC9 gene. The variant is present in conserved region of ARM domain of ARMC9 protein, which is predicted to form a platform for protein interaction. This domain is likely to be altered in patient due to splicing defect caused by this synonymous variation. Our report of variant in ARMC9 Leading to Joubert syndrome phenotype (JS30), elucidates the genetic heterogeneity of Joubert syndrome, and expands the gene list for ciliopathies.","dc:creator":"Kar A","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"Whole exome sequencing reveals a mutation in ARMC9 as a cause of mental retardation, ptosis, and polydactyly."}},"rdfs:label":"Kar 2018 Family- II:1, male"},{"id":"cggv:a9390bf2-2cd3-451c-bec5-24c73edbb117","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a9390bf2-2cd3-451c-bec5-24c73edbb117_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1,"dc:description":"Should be downgraded for homozygosity at a total of 0.1 points.

was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Joubert Syndrome 30 in 2017 (PMID:28625504). Joubert syndrome is a rare genetic condition characterized by abnormal brain development that includes the absence or underdevelopment of the cerebellar vermis and a malformed brain stem. Seventeen variants (missense, nonsense, frameshift, splice site) reported in thirteen probands in seven publications (PMIDs: 28625504, 29159890, 35186037, 36584995, 36580738, 30712878, 32304219) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) was reached. This gene-disease association is also supported by a knockout zebrafish model, functional alteration data, and expression studies (PMIDs: 28625504, 32453716). In summary, *ARMC9* is “Definitively” associated with and defined as an autosomal recessive Ciliopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Kidney Cystic and Ciliopathy GCEP on the meeting date 6/28/2023 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:77d8b454-195d-463c-b043-fc068392a23b"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
