LPI is relatively common in Finland and a few clusters of patients are known in Italy and Japan. The SLC7A7 gene, mutated in LPI patients, encodes the y+LAT-1 protein which is the light subunit of a heterodimeric CAA transporter. We performed the mutation analysis in seven probands from five unrelated LPI families and identified five novel SLC7A7 mutations (p.M50K, p.T188I, p.R333M, p.Y457X, and c.499+?_629-?). By expression studies in X. laevis oocytes or patient's renal tubular cells, the functional analysis of altogether eight SLC7A7 mutations is here reported. Noteworthy, the p.R333M mutation, caused by a G to T transversion of the last nucleotide at 3' end of exon 7, disrupts a functional splicing motif generating misspliced transcripts. Three of the novel mutations were found in patients originating from Greece and Pakistan thus increasing the list of ethnic backgrounds where LPI mutant alleles are present.

On a normal diet, LPI patients present poor feeding, vomiting, diarrhoea, episodes of hyperammoniaemic coma and failure to thrive. Hepatosplenomegaly, osteoporosis and a life-threatening pulmonary involvement (alveolar proteinosis) are also seen. LPI is caused by defective cationic amino acid (CAA) transport at the basolateral membrane of epithelial cells in kidney and intestine. Metabolic derangement is characterized by increased renal excretion of CAA, reduced CAA absorption from intestine and orotic aciduria. The gene causing LPI was assigned using linkage analysis to chromosome 14q11.2 near the T-cell receptor alpha/delta chains locus, and a critical region has been defined. We have identified two new transcripts (SLC7A8 and SLC7A7) homologous to amino acid transporters, highly expressed in kidney and mapping in the LPI critical region. Mutational analysis of both transcripts revealed that SLC7A7 (for solute carrier family 7, member 7) is mutated in LPI. In five Italian patients, we found either an insertion or deletion in the coding sequence, which provides evidence of a causative role of SLC7A7 in LPI. Furthermore, we detected a splice acceptor change resulting in a frameshift and premature translation termination in four unrelated Finnish patients.

The gene causing LPI has been assigned by linkage analysis to 14q11-13. Here we report mutations in SLC7A7 cDNA (encoding y+L amino acid transporter-1, y+LAT-1), which expresses dibasic amino-acid transport activity and is located in the LPI region, in 31 Finnish LPI patients and 1 Spanish patient. The Finnish patients are homozygous for a founder missense mutation leading to a premature stop codon. The Spanish patient is a compound heterozygote with a missense mutation in one allele and a frameshift mutation in the other. The frameshift mutation generates a premature stop codon, eliminating the last one-third of the protein. The missense mutation abolishes y+LAT-1 amino-acid transport activity when co-expressed with the heavy chain of the cell-surface antigen 4F2 (4F2hc, also known as CD98) in Xenopus laevis oocytes.

Human y+LAT-1 is a new member of a family of polytopic transmembrane proteins that are homologous to the yeast high affinity methionine permease MUP1. Other members of this family, the Xenopus laevis IU12 and the human KIAA0245 cDNAs, also co-express amino acid transport activity with 4F2hc in oocytes, with characteristics that are compatible with those of systems L and y+L, respectively. y+LAT-1 protein forms a approximately 135-kDa, disulfide bond-dependent heterodimer with 4F2hc in oocytes, which upon reduction results in two protein bands of approximately 85 kDa (i.e. 4F2hc) and approximately 40 kDa (y+LAT-1). Mutation of the human 4F2hc residue cysteine 109 (Cys-109) to serine abolishes the formation of this heterodimer and drastically reduces the co-expressed transport activity. These data suggest that y+LAT-1 and other members of this family are different 4F2 light chain subunits, which associated with 4F2hc, constitute different amino acid transporters. Human y+LAT-1 mRNA is expressed in kidney > peripheral blood leukocytes > lung > placenta = spleen > small intestine. The human y+LAT-1 gene localizes at chromosome 14q11.2 (17cR approximately 374 kb from D14S1350), within the lysinuric protein intolerance (LPI) locus (Lauteala, T., Sistonen, P. , Savontaus, M.

LPI is an inherited autosomal disease characterized by a defective dibasic amino acid transport in kidney, intestine, and other tissues.

We present here a model of an inborn aminoaciduria, lysinuric protein intolerance (LPI), in which a single mutation in y(+)LAT1 cationic amino acid transporter gene SLC7A7 leads to a multisystem disease characterized by immunological complications, life-threatening pulmonary alveolar proteinosis and nephropathy. Macrophages are suggested to play a central role in LPI in the development of these severe secondary symptoms. We thus studied the effect of the Finnish y(+)LAT1 mutation on monocyte-derived macrophages where toll-like receptors (TLRs) act as the key molecules in innate immune response against external pathogens. The function of LPI patient and control macrophage TLR signaling was examined by stimulating the TLR2/1, TLR4 and TLR9 pathways with their associated pathogen-associated molecular patterns. Downregulation in expression of TLR9, IRF7, IRF3 and IFNB1 and in secretion of IFN-α was detected, suggesting an impaired response to TLR9 stimulation. In addition, secretion of TNF-α, IL-12 and IL-1RA by TLR2/1 stimulation and IL-12 and IL-1RA by TLR4 stimulation was increased in the LPI patients. LPI macrophages secreted significantly less nitric oxide than control macrophages, whereas plasma concentrations of inflammatory chemokines CXCL8, CXCL9 and CXCL10 were elevated in the LPI patients. In conclusion, our results strengthen the relevance of macrophages in the pathogenesis of LPI and, furthermore, suggest that cationic amino acid transport plays an important role in the regulation of innate immune responses.

Here, we describe the consequences of inactivating Slc7a7 in a mouse model of LPI. The Slc7a7 mutation was generated by high-throughput retroviral gene-trapping in embryonic stem cells. The Slc7a7(-/-) mouse displayed intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), commonly leading to neonatal lethality. After heavy protein ingestion, the surviving adult animals presented metabolic derangement consistent with that observed in human LPI. IUGR was investigated by examining the expression of main factors controlling fetal growth. Insulin-like growth factor 1, the dominant fetal growth regulator in late gestation, was markedly downregulated as demonstrated by quantitative real-time RT-PCR, immunostaining and Western blot analysis in fetal liver. To further explore the pathophysiology of LPI, gene expression profiling analyses were carried out by DNA microarray technology in intestine and liver of adult Slc7a7(-/-) mice. Significant upregulation or downregulation (twofold or greater) was observed for 488 transcripts in intestine, and for 521 transcripts in the liver.

Variants in SLC7A7 were first reported in\nhumans with this disease as early as 1999 (Torrents et al., PMID:10080182 AND Borsani et al., PMID:10080183). At least 9 variants (e.g. missense, nonsense, frameshift, large deletion, etc) have been reported in humans, with many more being provided in the literature. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level\ndata, segregation data, and experimental data.\nVariants in this gene have been reported in at least 8 probands in 3 publications (PMIDs: 10080182, 10080183, 15776247). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 2 additional family members. Significantly more evidence and probands are available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence has been reached. The mechanism for disease is homozygous loss of function, with the mutated proteins not able to fulfill their function of amino acid transport through the plasma membrane causing CAA homeostasis alterations and resulting in the displayed symptoms like vomiting, protein avoidance, and growth delay. This gene-disease association is supported by animal models, expression studies, in vitro functional assays, and biochemical function evidence. The null mouse model markedly recapitulates the phenotype of the human probands, as does the cultured patient macrophage cells demonstrate the altered CAA transport and its resulting effects. The protein's primary expression in the kidney is also notable because of the disease mechanism of reduced CAA uptake in the kidney.\nIn summary, SLC7A7 is definitively associated with Autosomal Recessive Lysinuric Protein Intolerance. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Aminoacidopathy Working Group on 11/08/19 (SOP Version 007).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:207778e3-aff9-427d-ae87-f68fd938af88"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
