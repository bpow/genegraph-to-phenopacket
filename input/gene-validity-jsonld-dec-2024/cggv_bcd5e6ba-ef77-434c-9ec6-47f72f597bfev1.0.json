We screened by DHPLC the RYR1 gene in 24 subjects for mutations, and characterized functional alterations caused by some RYR1 variants. Three novel sequence variants and twenty novel polymorphisms were identified. Immortalized lymphoblastoid cell lines from patients with RYR1 variants and from controls were stimulated with 4-chloro-m-cresol (4-CmC) and the rate of extracellular acidification was recorded. We demonstrate that the increased acidification rate of lymphoblastoid cells in response to 4-CmC is mainly due to RYR1 activation. Cells expressing RYR1 variants in the N-terminal and in the central region of the protein (p.Arg530His, p.Arg2163Pro, p.Asn2342Ser, p.Glu2371Gly and p.Arg2454His) displayed higher activity compared with controls; this could account for the MH-susceptible phenotype. Cell lines harboring RYR1(Cys4664Arg) were significantly less activated by 4-CmC. This result indicates that the p.Cys4664Arg variant causes a leaky channel and depletion of intracellular stores.

The RYR1 mutation p.Arg4737Trp has been recently detected in a German MH family. To evaluate the effects of that mutation on intracellular calcium handling, the response after stimulation with the RYR1 agonist 4-chloro-m-cresol was investigated in immortalized B lymphocytes containing the p.Arg4737Trp mutation and compared to the response of wild type RYR1 from unaffected family members and unrelated controls. Intracellular resting calcium was slightly but significantly elevated in mutation positive cells. Calcium release following stimulation with 4-chloro-m-cresol was significantly increased in B lymphocytes carrying the p.Arg4737Trp mutation compared to mutation negative controls.

Seven different causative mutations (as defined by the European Malignant Hyperthermia Group) in nine malignant hyperthermia susceptible individuals were identified. In another six malignant hyperthermia susceptible individuals, five different published but as yet functionally uncharacterised mutations were identified. A further three as yet unpublished and functionally uncharacterised (novel) mutations were identified in three malignant hyperthermia susceptible samples.

Based on the number of relatives presenting to our unit in the study period, the muscle biopsy rate would have decreased by 25%. That we only identified a genetic defect in RYR1 in 47% of in vitro contracture test positive individuals suggests that there are other areas in RYR1 where pathogenic mutations may occur and that RYR1 may not be the sole gene associated with malignant hyperthermia.

We used this approach to explore the human secretome, the membrane proteome, the druggable proteome, the cancer proteome, and the metabolic functions in 32 different tissues and organs.

Mutation of tyrosine 522 of RyR1 (the predominant skeletal muscle calcium release channel) to serine has been associated with human malignant hyperthermia. In the present study, mice created harboring this mutation were found to represent the first murine model of human malignant hyperthermia. Mice homozygous for the Y522S mutation exhibit skeletal defects and die during embryonic development or soon after birth. Heterozygous mice, which correspond to the human occurrence of this mutation, are MH susceptible, experiencing whole body contractions and elevated core temperatures in response to isoflurane exposure or heat stress. Skeletal muscles from heterozygous mice exhibit increased susceptibility to caffeine- and heat-induced contractures in vitro. In addition, the heterozygous expression of the mutation results in enhanced RyR1 sensitivity to activation by temperature, caffeine, and voltage but not uncompensated sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium leak or store depletion. We conclude that the heterozygous expression of the Y522S mutation confers susceptibility to both heat- and anesthetic-induced MH responses.","dc:creator":"Chelu MG","dc:date":"2006","dc:title":"Heat- and anesthesia-induced malignant hyperthermia in an RyR1 knock-in mouse."},"rdfs:label":"Knock-in mouse model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:0681352b-205e-445b-a6e4-c478d051bbbc","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:cf46cc9b-2f09-4e33-b6eb-a39feff01498","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Both humans and mice experience malignant hyperthermia when exposed to volatile anesthetics.

(PMID:1774074). Malignant hyperthermia is a pharmacogenetic disorder of skeletal muscle calcium regulation associated with uncontrolled skeletal muscle metabolism with significant morbidity in response to specific anesthetics. Numerous unique missense variants have been reported in humans and the mechanism for disease is heterozygous gain-of-function. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level, segregation, and experimental data. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. Of note, this gene has also been implicated in autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive congenital myopathies. These associations have been assessed separately by the ClinGen Congenital Myopathies GCEP. In summary, RYR1 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant malignant hyperthermia susceptibility. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen General GCEP on 11/25/2020. (SOP Version 8).\nPlease note that while the scoring table shows 13.5 total points, the total score for this curation is 17 points (12 point maximum for genetic evidence reached). This curation reached a definitive classification and the scoring in the table will be updated in the coming months.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:bcd5e6ba-ef77-434c-9ec6-47f72f597bfe"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
