Here, we describe a total of five individuals (from three unrelated families) in whom we identified mutations in PGAP3, encoding a protein that is involved in GPI-anchor maturation. Three siblings in a consanguineous Pakistani family presented with profound developmental delay, severe ID, no speech, psychomotor delay, and postnatal microcephaly. A combination of autozygosity mapping and exome sequencing identified a 13.8 Mb region harboring a homozygous c.275G>A (p.Gly92Asp) variant in PGAP3 region 17q11.2-q21.32. Subsequent testing showed elevated serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP), a GPI-anchored enzyme, in all three affected children. In two unrelated individuals in a cohort with developmental delay, ID, and elevated ALP, we identified compound-heterozygous variants c.439dupC (p.Leu147Profs(∗)16) and c.914A>G (p.Asp305Gly) and homozygous variant c.314C>G (p.Pro105Arg). The 1 bp duplication causes a frameshift and nonsense-mediated decay. Further evidence supporting pathogenicity of the missense mutations c.275G>A, c.314C>G, and c.914A>G was provided by the absence of the variants from ethnically matched controls, phylogenetic conservation, and functional studies on Chinese hamster ovary cell lines. Taken together with recent data on PGAP2, these results confirm the importance of the later GPI-anchor remodelling steps for normal neuronal development. Impairment of PGAP3 causes a subtype of hyperphosphatasia with ID, a congenital disorder of glycosylation that is also referred to as Mabry syndrome.","dc:creator":"Howard MF","dc:date":"2014","dc:title":"Mutations in PGAP3 impair GPI-anchor maturation, causing a subtype of hyperphosphatasia with mental retardation."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c63978db-fe31-489a-985c-6b353f0d5243_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c63978db-fe31-489a-985c-6b353f0d5243_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:14c693be-cf12-4cad-9eab-fd2350f093df","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:89a39f83-d148-408c-926e-994901815ed8","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"obo:MI_0915"},"dc:description":"C-terminally tagged PGAP3 constructs, PGAP3-EGFP and PGAP3-HA, can be specifically co-precipitated by FLAG-tagged PGAP2.

The apical delivery of GPI-APs is believed to result from their association with lipid rafts. We find that overexpression of C-terminally tagged PGAP3 caused predominant production of lysoGPI-APs, an intermediate precursor in the GPI lipid remodeling process in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. In these cells, produced lysoGPI-APs are not incorporated into detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs) but still are delivered apically, suggesting that GPI-AP association with DRMs is not necessary for apical targeting. In contrast, apical transport of both fully remodeled and lyso forms of GPI-APs is dependent on N-glycosylation, confirming a general role of N-glycans in apical protein transport. We also find that depletion of cholesterol causes apical-to-basolateral retargeting not only of fully remodeled GPI-APs, but also of lysoGPI-APs, as well as endogenous soluble and transmembrane proteins that would normally be targeted to the apical membrane. These findings confirm the essential role for cholesterol in the apical protein targeting and further demonstrate that the mechanism of cholesterol-dependent apical sorting is not related to DRM association of GPI-APs.","dc:creator":"Castillon GA","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"Apical sorting of lysoGPI-anchored proteins occurs independent of association with detergent-resistant membranes but dependent on their N-glycosylation."},"rdfs:label":"Castillon_PGAP3/2 Protein Interaction"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:c63978db-fe31-489a-985c-6b353f0d5243_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c2425000-82e5-407e-8156-447b541aee88","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:302fbfb8-1ad9-4d68-89be-3522c5469946","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Pgap3 morphants displayed defective neural tube formation during the early stages of nervous system development, affecting brain morphogenesis.

The expressivity of the clinical features in HPMRS varies from severe syndromic forms with multiple organ malformations to mild nonsyndromic intellectual disability. In about half of the patients with the clinical diagnosis of HPMRS, pathogenic mutations can be identified in the coding region in one of the six genes, one among them is PGAP3. In this work, we describe a screening approach with sequence specific baits for transcripts of genes of the GPI pathway that allows the detection of functionally relevant mutations also including introns and the 5' and 3' UTR. By this means, we also identified pathogenic noncoding mutations, which increases the diagnostic yield for HPMRS on the basis of intellectual disability and elevated serum alkaline phosphatase. In eight affected individuals from different ethnicities, we found seven novel pathogenic mutations in PGAP3. Besides five missense mutations, we identified an intronic mutation, c.558-10G>A, that causes an aberrant splice product and a mutation in the 3'UTR, c.*559C>T, that is associated with substantially lower mRNA levels. We show that our novel screening approach is a useful rapid detection tool for alterations in genes coding for key components of the GPI pathway.","dc:creator":"Knaus A","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"Rare Noncoding Mutations Extend the Mutational Spectrum in the PGAP3 Subtype of Hyperphosphatasia with Mental Retardation Syndrome."}},"rdfs:label":"Knaus_FamilyE_II-2"},{"id":"cggv:92e4693f-ea9c-4b35-9078-ad40780a6cac","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:92e4693f-ea9c-4b35-9078-ad40780a6cac_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:92e4693f-ea9c-4b35-9078-ad40780a6cac_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Flow cytometric analysis of patient cells showed that this missense mutation caused the decreased activity of PGAP3.

We describe the first three patients with HPMRS from sub-Saharan Africa. Detection was assisted by Face2Gene phenotype matching and confirmed by the presence of elevated serum alkaline phosphatase. All three patients had severe intellectual disability, absent speech, hypotonia and palatal abnormality (cleft palate in two, very high-arched palate in one), no or minimal brachytelephalangy, and high serum alkaline phosphatase levels. Additional findings included seizures in two, and brain imaging abnormalities in two. In all three patients HPMRS was a top-20 gestalt match using Face2Gene. The overall phenotype is consistent with descriptions in the literature of HPMRS type 4, although not specific to it. Whole exome sequencing in the index patient and his mother detected a candidate variant in a homozygous state in the index patient (PGAP3:c.557G>C, p.Arg186Thr) and heterozygous in the mother. Further variant interpretation indicated pathogenicity. Sanger sequencing of another two patients identified the same homozygous, pathogenic variant, confirming a diagnosis of HPMRS type 4. The shared homozygous variant in apparently unrelated families, and in the absence of consanguinity, suggests the possibility of genetic drift due to a population bottleneck effect, and further research is recommended.","dc:creator":"Bezuidenhout H","dc:date":"2020","dc:title":"Hyperphosphatasia with mental retardation syndrome type 4 in three unrelated South African patients."}},"rdfs:label":"Bezuidenhout _ Patient 1"},{"id":"cggv:01064bbf-8dc3-43e4-bb33-e08bbb36f68e","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:01064bbf-8dc3-43e4-bb33-e08bbb36f68e_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:2e42ab21-f879-47e8-86a2-929ef1a0c793_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2e42ab21-f879-47e8-86a2-929ef1a0c793","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":5,"allele":{"id":"cggv:bc15491f-efe2-4b2b-8c6a-987eec119d1a","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_033419.5(PGAP3):c.861G>T (p.Trp287Cys)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA353573"}},"detectionMethod":"cDNA/ high-throughput sequencing, Sanger sequencing \n","ethnicity":{"id":"cg:NotHispanicOrLatino"},"firstTestingMethod":"Other","phenotypeFreeText":"Serum total ALP (U/l)  830–1,000","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001263","obo:HP_0032795","obo:HP_0012758","obo:HP_0001344","obo:HP_0004379","obo:HP_0010804","obo:HP_0000657","obo:HP_0001251"],"secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:3efccb3f-5783-4a4a-a3a2-0a45c22fc033_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:bc15491f-efe2-4b2b-8c6a-987eec119d1a"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27120253"},"rdfs:label":"Knaus_FamilyC_II-1"},{"id":"cggv:3efccb3f-5783-4a4a-a3a2-0a45c22fc033","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3efccb3f-5783-4a4a-a3a2-0a45c22fc033_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:3efccb3f-5783-4a4a-a3a2-0a45c22fc033_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Flow cytometric analysis of patient cells showed that this missense mutation caused the decreased activity of PGAP3.

Common phenotypes in individuals with *PGAP3* pathogenic variants include severe global developmental delay, speech and language delay, intellectual disability, hypotonia, ataxia, seizures, distinct facial abnormalities (including broad nasal bridge and tip, short nose, long palpebral fissures, hypertelorism, long philtrum, thin and wide upper lip, large ear lobes, and full cheeks), autistic behaviour and sleep disturbances. Additionally, some patients exhibit cleft palate and microcephaly, decreased intrauterine fetal movements, cardiac problems, abnormal corpus callosum, and olfactory bulb agenesis. \n\nNineteen homozygous and compound heterozygous variants (13 missense, 1 splicing, 2 frameshift, 2 nonsense, and 1 UTR), reported in seven publications have been included in this curation (PMIDs: 24439110, 27120253, 29531774, 30217754, 30345601, 32726939, 32845056). The presumed mechanism of pathogenicity based on published evidence is loss of function whereby variants in the *PGAP3* gene lead to a reduction in functional GPI-anchored proteins. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by a zebrafish animal model and protein interaction data (Da'as et al., 2020, PMID: 32726939; Castillon et al., 2013, PMID: 23615438).\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *PGAP3* and autosomal recessive hyperphosphatasia with intellectual disability syndrome 4. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings. This classification was approved by the Intellectual Disability and Autism Gene Curation Expert Panel on the meeting date September 5, 2023 (SOP Version 9).\n\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:c63978db-fe31-489a-985c-6b353f0d5243"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
