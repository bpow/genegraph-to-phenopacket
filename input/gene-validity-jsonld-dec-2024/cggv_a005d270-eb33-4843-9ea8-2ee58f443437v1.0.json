Catalytic activities of the mitochondrial respiratory complexes I and II were deficient in skeletal muscle, a finding suggestive of an inborn error in mitochondrial biogenesis. Homozygosity mapping identified IBA57 located in the largest homozygous region on chromosome 1 as a culprit candidate gene. IBA57 is known to be involved in the biosynthesis of mitochondrial [4Fe-4S] proteins. Sequence analysis of IBA57 revealed the homozygous mutation c.941A > C, p.Gln314Pro. Severely decreased amounts of IBA57 protein were observed in skeletal muscle and cultured skin fibroblasts from the affected subjects. HeLa cells depleted of IBA57 showed biochemical defects resembling the ones found in patient-derived cells, including a decrease in various mitochondrial [4Fe-4S] proteins and in proteins covalently linked to lipoic acid (LA), a cofactor produced by the [4Fe-4S] protein LA synthase. The defects could be complemented by wild-type IBA57 and partially by mutant IBA57. As a result of the mutation, IBA57 protein was excessively degraded, an effect ameliorated by protease inhibitors. Hence, we propose that the mutation leads to partial functional impairment of IBA57, yet the major pathogenic impact is due to its proteolytic degradation below physiologically critical levels. In conclusion, the ensuing lethal complex biochemical phenotype of a novel metabolic syndrome results from multiple Fe/S protein defects caused by a deficiency in the Fe/S cluster assembly protein IBA57.","dc:creator":"Ajit Bolar N","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"Mutation of the iron-sulfur cluster assembly gene IBA57 causes severe myopathy and encephalopathy."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a005d270-eb33-4843-9ea8-2ee58f443437_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a005d270-eb33-4843-9ea8-2ee58f443437_ar_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalRecessiveVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":10.5},{"id":"cggv:ea2a66f9-ce6a-480e-9810-b92c7bc87b2d_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ea2a66f9-ce6a-480e-9810-b92c7bc87b2d","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":22,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:26c3f783-a8e4-42e9-9b11-dfe2c08631fe","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001010867.4(IBA57):c.150C>A (p.Cys50Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA345105145"}},{"id":"cggv:084c4260-a885-4b45-8ee4-d90219062e95","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001010867.4(IBA57):c.323A>C (p.Tyr108Ser)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA345106787"}}],"detectionMethod":"p.Y108S frequency in gnomAD v3.1.2 (af 0.000006578, only 1 allele\np.

A multiple mitochondrial dysfunctions syndrome was found in an infant presenting with a progressive leukoencephalopathy. Homozygosity mapping, whole exome sequencing, and functional studies were used to define the underlying molecular defect. Respiratory chain studies in skeletal muscle isolated from the proband revealed a combined deficiency of complexes I and II. In addition, western blotting indicated lack of protein lipoylation. The combination of these findings was suggestive for a defect in the iron-sulfur (Fe/S) protein assembly pathway. SNP array identified loss of heterozygosity in large chromosomal regions, covering the NFU1 and BOLA3, and the IBA57 and ABCB10 candidate genes, in 2p15-p11.2 and 1q31.1-q42.13, respectively. A homozygous c.436C > T (p.Arg146Trp) variant was detected in IBA57 using whole exome sequencing. Complementation studies in a HeLa cell line depleted for IBA57 showed that the mutant protein with the semi-conservative amino acid exchange was unable to restore the biochemical phenotype indicating a loss-of-function mutation of IBA57. In conclusion, defects in the Fe/S protein assembly gene IBA57 can cause autosomal recessive neurodegeneration associated with progressive leukodystrophy and fatal outcome at young age.

Their versatile functions may go back to the proposed role of their Fe/S cofactors in the origin of life as efficient catalysts and electron carriers. More than two decades ago, it was discovered that the in vivo synthesis of cellular Fe/S clusters and their integration into polypeptide chains requires assistance by complex proteinaceous machineries, despite the fact that Fe/S proteins can be assembled chemically in vitro. In prokaryotes, three Fe/S protein biogenesis systems are known; ISC, SUF, and the more specialized NIF. The former two systems have been transferred by endosymbiosis from bacteria to mitochondria and plastids, respectively, of eukaryotes. In their cytosol, eukaryotes use the CIA machinery for the biogenesis of cytosolic and nuclear Fe/S proteins. Despite the structural diversity of the protein constituents of these four machineries, general mechanistic concepts underlie the complex process of Fe/S protein biogenesis. This review provides a comprehensive and comparative overview of the various known biogenesis systems in Biology, and summarizes their common or diverging molecular mechanisms, thereby illustrating both the conservation and diverse adaptions of these four machineries during evolution and under different lifestyles. Knowledge of these fundamental biochemical pathways is not only of basic scientific interest, but is important for the understanding of human 'Fe/S diseases' and can be used in biotechnology.","dc:creator":"Braymer JJ","dc:date":"2021","dc:title":"Mechanistic concepts of iron-sulfur protein biogenesis in Biology."},"rdfs:label":"Overview of Iron Sulfur protein biogenesis in biology "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":">10 genes involved in late ISC machinery (4fe-4S) including LIAS, complex I, mAco, and direct interactions with ISCA1 and ISCA2"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:a005d270-eb33-4843-9ea8-2ee58f443437_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:bdce99ba-3bad-4f5b-b270-e6f05a1cee8c","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:40ef4de3-1898-46b0-b34b-e8315e09ac44","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Decreased IBA57 by WB, Decreased SDHB by WB\nDecreased activity of PDHc, aKGDHc, BCKHDc","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27785568","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Defects of the Fe/S cluster biosynthesis represent a subgroup of diseases affecting the mitochondrial energy metabolism. In the last years, mutations in four genes (NFU1, BOLA3, ISCA2 and IBA57) have been related to a new group of multiple mitochondrial dysfunction syndromes characterized by lactic acidosis, hyperglycinemia, multiple defects of the respiratory chain complexes, and impairment of four lipoic acid-dependent enzymes: α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex, pyruvic dehydrogenase, branched-chain α-keto acid dehydrogenase complex and the H protein of the glycine cleavage system. Few patients have been reported with mutations in IBA57 and with variable clinical phenotype. Herein, we describe four unrelated patients carrying novel mutations in IBA57. All patients presented with combined or isolated defect of complex I and II. Clinical features varied widely, ranging from fatal infantile onset of the disease to acute and severe psychomotor regression after the first year of life. Brain MRI was characterized by cavitating leukodystrophy. The identified mutations were never reported previously and all had a dramatic effect on IBA57 stability. Our study contributes to expand the array of the genotypic variation of IBA57 and delineates the leukodystrophic pattern of IBA57 deficient patients.","dc:creator":"Torraco A","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Novel mutations in IBA57 are associated with leukodystrophy and variable clinical phenotypes."},"rdfs:label":"Toracco et al patient 3 fibroblast studies "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"0.5 - Decreased IBA57 by WB, Decreased SDHB by WB + 0.5 Decreased activity of PDHc, aKGDHc, BCKHDc"},{"id":"cggv:dc8df806-dd86-43ed-9688-b689483d1044","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6605109b-3667-4630-b24c-744574e8c3c0","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"-Reduced IBA57 by Western Blot, Reduced NDUFS1, SDHA, SDHB by Western Blot\n-Significantly reduced PDHc, aKGDHc, and BCKDHc (branched chain keto acid dehydrogenase) activities in this patient's fibroblasts (lipoylated DHs)","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27785568","rdfs:label":"Fibroblasts studies on Torraco Patient 1 "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"0.5 for WB showing decreased IBA57 and decrease RC proteins + 0.5 decreased activity of lipoylated DHs "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":7553,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria9","strengthScore":16,"subject":{"id":"cggv:5be1e7b9-3157-4208-919f-6e9552b71ece","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0044970","gene":"hgnc:27302","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"The relationship between *IBA57* and primary mitochondrial disease was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of July 11, 2023. *IBA57* encodes an iron-sulfur cluster assembly protein that acts late in the biosynthetic pathway of mitochondrial 4Fe-4S proteins. \n\n*IBA57* was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive primary mitochondrial disease in 2013 (PMID: 23462291), in a neonate with intrauterine growth restriction, brain malformations detected in utero, hypotonia, microcephaly, and hyperglycinemia who died perinatally.  While various names have been given to the constellation of features seen in those with *IBA57*-related disease, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *IBA57* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework.\n\nEvidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included six unique variants (three missense, two nonsense, and one predicted missense variant resulting in splicing abnormalities), in five probands across four publications (PMIDs: 23462291, 25971455, 25609768, 28913435). Compelling familial segregation data was also included in scoring (PMID: 25609768). There are at least 50 cases reported in the literature through 2022 (PMID: 36360281). Two general clinical phenotypes have been reported. One is an infantile onset, sometimes fatal, microcephaly and cavitating leukodystrophy with or without other brain malformations with metabolic acidosis and hyperglycinemia. The other is childhood/adolescent onset spastic paraplegia with or without optic atrophy. Notably, this second phenotype is reported in relation to a variant impacting splicing. Affected individuals show reduction in activities and amounts of lipoate containing enzymes (PMIDs: 23462291, 25971455, 25609768, 28913435). \n \nThis gene-disease association is also supported by functional implication given protein interaction with other proteins of the Fe-S cluster biosynthesis and assembly machinery and the lipoylation pathway, as well as functional alteration in patient cells (PMIDs: 33007329, 27785568). \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between *IBA57* and primary mitochondrial disease. This has been repeatedly demonstrated and upheld over time, and no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts this gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on July 11, 2023 (SOP Version 9).
