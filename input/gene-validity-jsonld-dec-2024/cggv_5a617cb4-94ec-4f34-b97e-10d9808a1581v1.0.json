Since few are predicted to ablate directly an enzyme's catalytic site or other functionally important amino acid residues, how do most missense mutations cause loss of function and lead to disease? The classic monogenic phenotype hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA), manifesting notably as phenylketonuria (PKU), where missense mutations in the PAH gene compose 60% of the alleles impairing phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) function, allows us to examine this question. Here we characterize four PKU-associated PAH mutations (F39L, K42I, L48S, I65T), each changing an amino acid distant from the enzyme active site. Using three complementary in vitro protein expression systems, and 3D-structural localization, we demonstrate a common mechanism. PAH protein folding is affected, causing altered oligomerization and accelerated proteolytic degradation, leading to reduced cellular levels of this cytosolic protein. Enzyme specific activity and kinetic properties are not adversely affected, implying that the only way these mutations reduce enzyme activity within cells in vivo is by producing structural changes which provoke the cell to destroy the aberrant protein. The F39L, L48S, and I65T PAH mutations were selected because each is associated with a spectrum of in vivo HPA among patients.

A genotype/phenotype relationship that is strikingly similar to the human disease emerges, underscoring the similarity of phenylketonuria in mouse and man. In PAHENU1, the phenotype is mild. The Pahenu1 mutation predicts a conservative valine to alanine amino acid substitution and is located in exon 3, a gene region where serious mutations are rare in humans. In PAHENU2, the phenotype is severe. The Pahenu2 mutation predicts a radical phenylalanine to serine substitution and is located in exon 7, a gene region where serious mutations are common in humans.

The disease entity and causal enzyme was known well before the characterization of the PAH gene, with a relatively high disease prevalence of 1/10,000 people in European populations. Norwegian physician Ivar Asbjørn Følling first characterized the disease in 1934 by linking phenylketones in the urine to the intellectual disability and other presenting phenotypes, with a later publication demonstrating the positive effect of a low phenylalanine diet on probands (Bickel, Gerrard, and Hickmans, PMID: 13138177). By the time PAH was characterized, phenylketonuria was widely examined on newborn screening panels which limits the number of probands that display symptoms aside from the biochemical abnormality. Over 500 unique variants (e.g. missense, in-frame indel, nonsense, frameshift, large deletion, complex rearrangement, etc) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes a more than sufficient amount of each case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data.\nSince the initial characterization of PAH in 1986, there have been numerous publications detailing probands and the variants they harbor. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 23 probands in various publications. Variants in this gene also segregated with the disease in over 10 additional family members. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence and experimental evidence has been reached.\nThe mechanism for disease is biallelic loss of function, with pathogenic mutations disrupting the ability of phenylalanine hydroxylase in combination with tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) to catalyze the conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine as the first step in phenylalanine metabolism (PMID: 1301187). This phenylalanine buildup causes neurological phenotypes such as intellectual disability and other serious medical problems.\nThis gene-disease association is additionally supported by multiple mouse models, rescues, expression studies, in vitro functional assays, and its interactions with the cofactor BH4. Multiple mouse models with known pathogenic PAH mutations have been developed and well-characterized over the years, with succesful rescues being performed on these models as well. Functional assays have demonstrated decreased PAH activity and increased phenylanaine with most pathogenic PAH mutations as well as the causal factor for many missense variants being PAH protein misfolding and resulting decreased function. Finally, BH4 (via the gene QDPR) has also been definitively implicated in hyperphenylalaninemia which further supports the phenylalanine pathway deficiencies being causal for the classic phenotypes. \nIn summary, PAH is definitively associated with Autosomal Recessive Phenylketonuria/Hyperphenylalaninemia. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This clinical validity classification was approved by the ClinGen Aminoacidopathy Gene Curation Expert Panel on 04/24/2020 (SOP Version 7).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:5a617cb4-94ec-4f34-b97e-10d9808a1581"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
