To date, two forms of the disease have been identified: SQT1, caused by a gain of function substitution in the HERG (I(Kr)) channel, and SQT2, caused by a gain of function substitution in the KvLQT1 (I(Ks)) channel. Here we identify a new variant, \"SQT3\", which has a unique ECG phenotype characterized by asymmetrical T waves, and a defect in the gene coding for the inwardly rectifying Kir2.1 (I(K1)) channel. The affected members of a single family had a G514A substitution in the KCNJ2 gene that resulted in a change from aspartic acid to asparagine at position 172 (D172N). Whole-cell patch-clamp studies of the heterologously expressed human D172N channel demonstrated a larger outward I(K1) than the wild-type (P<0.05) at potentials between -75 mV and -45 mV, with the peak current being shifted in the former with respect to the latter (WT, -75 mV; D172N, -65 mV). Coexpression of WT and mutant channels to mimic the heterozygous condition of the proband yielded an outward current that was intermediate between WT and D172N. In computer simulations using a human ventricular myocyte model the increased outward I(K1) greatly accelerated the final phase of repolarization, and shortened the action potential duration. Hence, unlike the known mutations in the two other SQTS forms (N588K in HERG and V307L in KvLQT1), simulations using the D172N and WT/D172N mutations fully accounted for the ECG phenotype of tall and asymmetrically shaped T waves. Although we were unable to test for inducibility of arrhythmia susceptibility due to lack of patients' consent, our computer simulations predict a steeper steady-state restitution curve for the D172N and WT/D172N mutation, compared with WT or to HERG or KvLQT1 mutations, which may predispose SQT3 patients to a greater risk of reentrant arrhythmias.","dc:creator":"Priori SG","dc:date":"2005","dc:title":"A novel form of short QT syndrome (SQT3) is caused by a mutation in the KCNJ2 gene."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15761194","rdfs:label":"III-1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADDeNovoCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:ffab1f4f-0778-48ab-955a-01c76e146527_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e3d191e2-bede-4e30-8185-04fca7958318","type":"Proband","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:ffab1f4f-0778-48ab-955a-01c76e146527_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:d396109b-177a-4bb7-982b-0a6f31bf3ac7","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000891.2(KCNJ2):c.896A>T (p.Glu299Val)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA302052"}},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"none","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23440193","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"We describe a mutation (E299V) in KCNJ2, the gene that encodes the strong inward rectifier K(+) channel protein (Kir2.1), in an 11-y-old boy. The unique short QT syndrome type-3 phenotype is associated with an extremely abbreviated QT interval (200 ms) on ECG and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Genetic screening identified an A896T substitution in a highly conserved region of KCNJ2 that resulted in a de novo mutation E299V. Whole-cell patch-clamp experiments showed that E299V presents an abnormally large outward IK1 at potentials above -55 mV (P < 0.001 versus wild type) due to a lack of inward rectification. Coexpression of wild-type and mutant channels to mimic the heterozygous condition still resulted in a large outward current. Coimmunoprecipitation and kinetic analysis showed that E299V and wild-type isoforms may heteromerize and that their interaction impairs function. The homomeric assembly of E299V mutant proteins actually results in gain of function. Computer simulations of ventricular excitation and propagation using both the homozygous and heterozygous conditions at three different levels of integration (single cell, 2D, and 3D) accurately reproduced the electrocardiographic phenotype of the proband, including an exceedingly short QT interval with merging of the QRS and the T wave, absence of ST segment, and peaked T waves. Numerical experiments predict that, in addition to the short QT interval, absence of inward rectification in the E299V mutation should result in atrial fibrillation. In addition, as predicted by simulations using a geometrically accurate three-dimensional ventricular model that included the His-Purkinje network, a slight reduction in ventricular excitability via 20% reduction of the sodium current should increase vulnerability to life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmia.","dc:creator":"Deo M","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"KCNJ2 mutation in short QT syndrome 3 results in atrial fibrillation and ventricular proarrhythmia."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23440193","rdfs:label":"I-1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADDeNovoCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalDominantDeNovoVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":6},{"id":"cggv:9111653a-7d9c-4d0e-94d9-daaa208a0b05_experimental_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9111653a-7d9c-4d0e-94d9-daaa208a0b05_functional_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b3098687-f1eb-47cd-96b9-5abd6f1dab2f","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:58161273-7679-455b-8028-8ec179a79d4b","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11410627","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"1. Ventricular myocytes demonstrate a steeply inwardly rectifying K(+) current termed I(K1). We investigated the molecular basis for murine I(K1) by removing the genes encoding Kir2.1 and Kir2.2. The physiological consequences of the loss of these genes were studied in newborn animals because mice lacking Kir2.1 have a cleft palate and die shortly after birth. 2. Kir2.1 (-/-) ventricular myocytes lack detectable I(K1) in whole-cell recordings in 4 mM external K(+). In 60 mM external K(+) a small, slower, residual current is observed. Thus Kir2.1 is the major determinant of I(K1). Sustained outward K(+) currents and Ba(2+) currents through L- and T-type channels were not significantly altered by the mutation. A 50 % reduction in I(K1) was observed in Kir2.2 (-/-) mice, raising the possibility that Kir2.2 can also contribute to the native I(K1). 3. Kir2.1 (-/-) myocytes showed significantly broader action potentials and more frequent spontaneous action potentials than wild-type myocytes. 4. In electrocardiograms of Kir2.1 (-/-) neonates, neither ectopic beats nor re-entry arrhythmias were observed. Thus the increased automaticity and prolonged action potential of the mutant ventricular myocytes were not sufficiently severe to disrupt the sinus pacing of the heart. The Kir2.1 (-/-) mice, however, had consistently slower heart rates and this phenotype is likely to arise indirectly from the influence of Kir2.1 outside the heart. 5.
