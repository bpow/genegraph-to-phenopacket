The selective elimination of each GAD isoform by gene targeting is expected to clarify these issues. Recently we have produced GAD65 -/- mice and demonstrated that lack of GAD65 does not change brain GABA contents or animal behavior, except for a slight increase in susceptibility to seizures. Here we report the production of GAD67 -/- mice. These mice were born at the expected frequency but died of severe cleft palate during the first morning after birth. GAD activities and GABA contents were reduced to 20% and 7%, respectively, in the cerebral cortex of the newborn GAD67 -/- mice. Their brain, however, did not show any discernible defects.

To bypass this and enable observation of the neurological defects resulting from knocking down gad1 expression, a photoactivatable morpholino oligonucleotide (MO) against gad1 was prepared by cyclization with a photocleavable linker rendering the MO inactive. The cyclized MO was stable in the dark and toward degradative enzymes and was completely linearized upon brief exposure to 405 nm light. In the course of investigating the function of the ccMOs in zebrafish, we discovered that zebrafish possess paralogous gad1 genes, gad1a and gad1b. A gad1b MO injected at the 1-4 cell stage caused severe morphological defects in head development, which could be bypassed, enabling the fish to develop normally, if the fish were injected with a photoactivatable, cyclized gad1b MO and grown in the dark. At 1 day post fertilization (dpf), light activation of the gad1b MO followed by observation at 3 and 7 dpf led to increased and abnormal electrophysiological brain activity compared to wild type animals.

Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data. At least 15 unique variants (missense, nonsense, frameshift, in-frame deletion, and splicing) have been reported in humans. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 14 probands in 5 publications (PMIDs: 28454995, 31144778, 32282878, 15571623, 32705143). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in additional family members. This gene-disease association is supported by its function in glutamate decarboxylase activity (PMID: 1549570), its expression in the brain (PMID: 9177246), and zebrafish model (PMID: 30200754) as well as three mouse models (PMIDs: 9177246, 9326630, 20333300) that partially recapitulate disease. In summary, GAD1 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive epileptic encephalopathy.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:20fdee08-81b0-4957-a18a-8f622e0ab054"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
