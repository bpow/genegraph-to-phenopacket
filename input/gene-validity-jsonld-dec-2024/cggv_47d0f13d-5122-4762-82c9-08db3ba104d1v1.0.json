In this study, we examined the effects of overexpressing wild-type (G0) and kidney disease risk variants (G1 and G2) of APOL1 in human podocytes using a lentivirus expression system. Interestingly, G0 inflicted podocyte injury only at a higher concentration; however, G1 and G2 promoted moderate podocyte injury at lower and higher concentrations. APOL1Vs expressing podocytes displayed diffuse distribution of both Lucifer yellow dye and cathepsin L as manifestations of enhanced lysosomal membrane permeability (LMP). Chloroquine attenuated the APOL1Vs-induced increase in podocyte injury, consistent with targeting lysosomes. The chloride channel blocker DIDS prevented APOL1Vs- induced injury, indicating a role for chloride influx in osmotic swelling of lysosomes. Direct exposure of noninfected podocytes with conditioned media from G1- and G2-expressing podocytes also induced injury, suggesting a contributory role of the secreted component of G1 and G2 as well. Adverse host factors (AHFs) such as hydrogen peroxide, hypoxia, TNF-α, and puromycin aminonucleoside augmented APOL1- and APOL1Vs-induced podocyte injury, while the effect of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) on podocyte injury was overwhelming under conditions of APOLVs expression.

Compared with the reference sequence, the two disease-associated variants show increased stable association with phospholipid vesicles under conditions that support the cation permease activity, suggesting that the increased activity may be due to more efficient membrane association and insertion. There is no difference in membrane association among isoforms under optimal conditions for the anion permease activity. These data support a model in which enhanced cation permeability may contribute to the progressive kidney diseases associated with high-risk ApoL1 alleles.","dc:creator":"Bruno J","dc:date":"2021","dc:title":"Kidney-disease-associated variants of Apolipoprotein L1 show gain of function in cation channel activity."},"rdfs:label":"cation-selective ion permease activity in phospholipid vesic"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:47d0f13d-5122-4762-82c9-08db3ba104d1_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4e6a0eb0-ab27-4fa8-9b49-1145bd38a1c4","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d0e73d2b-96aa-4a45-aa5e-20e629f31cc4","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Mouse develop functional (albuminuria, azotemia), structural (foot process effacement\nand glomerulosclerosis) and molecular (gene expression) changes that closely resemble the human\nkidney disease.

Direct evidence demonstrating that these APOL1 risk alleles are pathogenic is still lacking because the APOL1 gene is present in only some primates and humans; thus it has been challenging to demonstrate experimental proof of causality of these risk alleles for renal disease. Here we generated mice with podocyte-specific inducible expression of the APOL1 reference allele (termed G0) or each of the risk-conferring alleles (G1 or G2). We show that mice with podocyte-specific expression of either APOL1 risk allele, but not of the G0 allele, develop functional (albuminuria and azotemia), structural (foot-process effacement and glomerulosclerosis) and molecular (gene-expression) changes that closely resemble human kidney disease. Disease development was cell-type specific and likely reversible, and the severity correlated with the level of expression of the risk allele. We further found that expression of the risk-variant APOL1 alleles interferes with endosomal trafficking and blocks autophagic flux, which ultimately leads to inflammatory-mediated podocyte death and glomerular scarring. In summary, this is the first demonstration that the expression of APOL1 risk alleles is causal for altered podocyte function and glomerular disease in vivo.","dc:creator":"Beckerman P","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Transgenic expression of human APOL1 risk variants in podocytes induces kidney disease in mice."},"rdfs:label":"Podoctye-specific overexpression of G0 vs G1 or G2 APOL1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:9f151117-6e05-4e67-9b45-5f17c79b5654","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:025060af-7f56-46ad-96a5-d9bb7c9acba9","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"APOL1 risk variants (G1, G2) have been associated with high OR of developing HIVAN (glomerular disease in uncontrolled HIV infection) and in response to systemic interferon therapy.

A large fraction of this disparity is due to two coding sequence variants in the APOL1 gene. Inheriting two copies of these APOL1 risk variants, known as G1 and G2, causes high rates of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), HIV-associated nephropathy and hypertension-associated end-stage kidney disease. Disease risk follows a recessive mode of inheritance, which is puzzling given the considerable data that G1 and G2 are toxic gain-of-function variants. We developed coisogenic bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) transgenic mice harboring either the wild-type (G0), G1 or G2 forms of human APOL1. Expression of interferon gamma (IFN-γ) via plasmid tail vein injection results in upregulation of APOL1 protein levels together with robust induction of heavy proteinuria and glomerulosclerosis in G1/G1 and G2/G2 but not G0/G0 mice. The disease phenotype was greater in G2/G2 mice. Neither heterozygous (G1/G0 or G2/G0) risk variant mice nor hemizygous (G1/-, G2/-) mice had significant kidney injury in response to IFN-γ, although the heterozygous mice had a greater proteinuric response than the hemizygous mice, suggesting that the lack of significant disease in humans heterozygous for G1 or G2 is not due to G0 rescue of G1 or G2 toxicity. Studies using additional mice (multicopy G2 and a non-isogenic G0 mouse) supported the notion that disease is largely a function of the level of risk variant APOL1 expression. Together, these findings shed light on the recessive nature of APOL1-nephropathy and present an important model for future studies.","dc:creator":"McCarthy GM","dc:date":"2021","dc:title":"Recessive, gain-of-function toxicity in an APOL1 BAC transgenic mouse model mirrors human APOL1 kidney disease."},"rdfs:label":"BAC transgenic animals exposed to high INFgamma state."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":6}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":4063,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria8","strengthScore":18,"subject":{"id":"cggv:84a3ff8a-d20b-4fb2-a9d6-f6d0db3b7052","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0012931","gene":"hgnc:618","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"The *APOL1* gene is located on chromosome 22 at 22q12.3 and encodes the APOL1 protein.  APOL1 is found associated with HDL particles in human circulation, and is capable of forming cation-conducting pores (PMID: 25730870).  It acts as a trypanolytic factor, inducing lysosomal swelling and ultimate trypanosome death via its actions as a channel (PMID: 12621437, 16020735).  APOL1 may have other innate immune functions, and is highly upregulated in endothelial cells and podocytes in response to interferons and TLR agonists (PMID: 25100047).  Two variants in *APOL1* were first reported to dramatically increase susceptibility to focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN), and hypertensive end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) in 2010 (Genovese et al., PMID: 20647424). These variants, generally termed G1 (ClinVar Variation ID: 6080; encoding S342G and I384M amino-acid changes) and G2 (ClinVar Variation ID: 6081; encoding deletion of amino acids N388 and Y389), are present at high frequencies in populations with recent African ancestry (PMID: 25168832).  These variants evade inhibition by the serum resistance-associated protein (SRA) expressed by Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense to neutralize wild-type APOL1, potentially explaining the high frequency of these otherwise deleterious variants in certain African populations (PMID: 20647424).  Multiple case-control and population studies have confirmed the original studies demonstrating an increased odds ratio of various (but not all) kidney and glomerular diseases in persons carrying two of the risk alleles, i.e. G1/G1, G2/G2 and compound heterozygous G1/G2 (PMID: 25100047, 25788523, 21997394, 23766536).  More evidence is available in the literature (PMID: 24504811, 23520206, 24731740, 32561682, 33576823, 34352311, 34670811), but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached.  *APOL1* variants have not been associated with an increased risk of developing diabetic kidney disease (PMID: 21997396) or IgA nephropathy (21997396). Risk conferred by these variants is best described via an autosomal recessive model, though a small disease risk is conferred by the presence of one vs. no risk alleles. This is supported by a mouse model (PMID: 34350953). However, mechanistically, the G1 and G2 variants appear to act as gain-of-function, increasing APOL1 channel activity (PMID: 33380423, 32427098) and APOL1-mediated cytotoxicity (PMID: 26091559, 26699492, 32427098, 24899058, 26089538).  APOL1 expression has been demonstrated in podocytes and glomeruli (PMID: 25012173, 21997392, 25100047).  In a mouse model, overexpression of risk-variant, but not wild-type, APOL1 in podocytes is sufficient to induce glomerular disease mimicking many aspects of FSGS (PMID: 28218918).  Homozygous risk allele, but not wild-type, APOL1 BAC mice develop progressive glomerular injury and renal failure in response to INFgamma exposure, mimicking human disease (PMID: 34350953).  Additional model system evidence is available in the literature (PMID: 27864430, 27864431, 30998685, 31217349, 32854642, 33517446), but the maximum score for experimental evidence was reached.  In summary, the presence of two copies of the *APOL1* risk variants G1 and/or G2 (ClinVar Variation IDs: 6080 and 6081) is definitively associated with an increased susceptibility to multiple glomerular and hypertensive kidney diseases, most prominently FSGS and HIVAN (OMIM:612551). The preferred disease name suggested for this grouping of disorders is ‘Glomerulopathy, susceptibility - *APOL1*’. This gene-disease relationship has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:47d0f13d-5122-4762-82c9-08db3ba104d1"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
