Under carbamazepine monotherapy, the patient presented hypoparathyroidism accompanied by severe hypocalcemia. Subsequently, renal ultrasound analysis revealed bilateral multicystic dysplastic kidneys. Because she had difficulty hearing, we sequenced GATA3 and determined that she had a c.708_709insC (p.Ser237Glnfs*66) allelic variant in exon 3. As a result, we found a family of this disease. Each family member, including her grandfather, mother, and two siblings, had HDR syndrome of varying clinical penetrance. We found a craniofacial anomaly, congenital choanal atresia, which was inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. Hypocalcemia coupled with vitamin D deficiency, triggered by carbamazepine treatment, ultimately revealed the proband's childhood- onset HDR syndrome. Pure-tone audiometry revealed different severities of deafness as well as the progression of sensory hearing loss.

Conditional knockout of Gata3 in the developing inner ear disrupts the morphogenesis of mouse inner ear, resulting in a disorganized and shortened cochlear duct with significant fewer hair cells and supporting cells. Loss of Gata3 function leads to the failure in the specification of prosensory domain and subsequently, to increased cell death in the cochlear duct. Moreover, though the initial generation of cochleovestibular ganglion (CVG) cells is not affected in Gata3-null mice, spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) are nearly depleted due to apoptosis. Our results demonstrate the essential role of Gata3 in specifying the prosensory domain in the cochlea and in regulating the survival of SGNs, thus identifying a molecular mechanism underlying human HDR syndrome.

In this study, we show that Gata3 activates transcription of parathyroid hormone (PTH), which is secreted from parathyroid glands and is critical for regulating serum calcium and phosphate homeostasis. Gata3 interacted with Gcm2 and MafB, two known transcriptional regulators of parathyroid development, and synergistically stimulated the PTH promoter. An SP1-binding element (GC box) located within the PTH-promoter proximal region was critical for activating transcription by Gata3. In addition, the ubiquitous transcription factor SP1 also interacted with Gata3 as well as MafB and Gcm2, and HDR syndrome-associated Gata3 mutants were defective in activating the PTH promoter. These results suggest that Gata3 is a critical regulator of PTH gene expression.

Number of inner hair cells (IHC) was normal. Surviving OHCs matured normally, but IHCs failed to acquire the characteristic mature basolateral currents and to down-regulate the immature-type channels like to the cholinergic efferent systems. This shows gata3 affects all hair cell, but it affects OHCs and IHCs differently. \n\nIHC numbers are maintained in gata3+/− mice, their biophysical differentiation is incomplete and could contribute to the observed hearing loss both in the mouse model and in HDR syndrome.\n\nAdult gata3+/− mice (>1 month old) suffer general morphological degeneration of cochlear sensory cells, especially of OHCs, in young adults. \n\nAbsence of any effect in gata3+/fl otof-cre+/− mice suggests less sensitivity to gata3 haploinsufficiency in IHCs during early postnatal development. Results predict measurable hearing loss without loss of DPOAEs in gata3fl/fl otof-cre+/− mice. The ABR thresholds were largely elevated, although they were not as severe as for gata3+/− mice at a comparable age  At 1.7 months, gata3fl/fl otof-cre+/− mice had about 20 dB of hearing loss across all frequencies, whereas the gata3+/− mice had a 30 dB loss. \nFull knock-down of gata3 in IHCs led to progressive hearing loss, which becomes profound by 7 months. Such progression was not observed in gata3+/− mice, although it might have been masked by the background loss with age for the mouse strain.
