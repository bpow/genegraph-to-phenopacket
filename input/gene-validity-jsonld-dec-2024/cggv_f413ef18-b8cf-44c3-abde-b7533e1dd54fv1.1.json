We recently identified a truncating frameshift mutation in the Cacna2d4 gene in a spontaneous mouse mutant with profound loss of retinal signaling and an abnormal morphology of ribbon synapses in rods and cones. The Cacna2d4 gene encodes an l-type calcium-channel auxiliary subunit of the alpha (2) delta type. Mutations in its human orthologue, CACNA2D4, were not yet known to be associated with a disease. We performed mutation analyses of 34 patients who received an initial diagnosis of night blindness, and, in two affected siblings, we detected a homozygous nucleotide substitution (c.2406C-->A) in CACNA2D4. The mutation introduces a premature stop codon that truncates one-third of the corresponding open reading frame. Both patients share symptoms of slowly progressing cone dystrophy. These findings represent the first report of a mutation in the human CACNA2D4 gene and define a novel gene defect that causes autosomal recessive cone dystrophy.","dc:creator":"Wycisk KA","dc:date":"2006","dc:title":"Mutation in the auxiliary calcium-channel subunit CACNA2D4 causes autosomal recessive cone dystrophy."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f413ef18-b8cf-44c3-abde-b7533e1dd54f_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b7fb6f1a-f037-40ab-941c-888ff3ed2b05_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b7fb6f1a-f037-40ab-941c-888ff3ed2b05","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":22,"allele":{"id":"cggv:a98c7a61-350e-4e08-9c05-6545361a4fdf","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_172364.5(CACNA2D4):c.1882C>T (p.Arg628Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA204549"}},"ethnicity":{"id":"cg:NotHispanicOrLatino"},"firstTestingMethod":"Whole genome shotgun sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0007663","obo:HP_0000007","obo:HP_0000613","obo:HP_0000551","obo:HP_0000548","obo:HP_0500041","obo:HP_0000512"],"secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:53adb643-b9ed-495b-93a7-1da400f5c85d_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:a98c7a61-350e-4e08-9c05-6545361a4fdf"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26560832","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:creator":"Ba-Abbad R","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"Mutations in CACNA2D4 Cause Distinctive Retinal Dysfunction in Humans."}},"rdfs:label":"Proband 1"},{"id":"cggv:53adb643-b9ed-495b-93a7-1da400f5c85d","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:53adb643-b9ed-495b-93a7-1da400f5c85d_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:40329375-c051-433d-9bd4-84bff4d2cf69_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:40329375-c051-433d-9bd4-84bff4d2cf69","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:a98c7a61-350e-4e08-9c05-6545361a4fdf"},"detectionMethod":"A subset of the pathogenic SNVs and indels was confirmed by Sanger sequencing.

We identified pathogenic variants (single-nucleotide variants, indels, or structural variants) for 404/722 (56%) individuals. Whole-genome sequencing gives unprecedented power to detect three categories of pathogenic variants in particular: structural variants, variants in GC-rich regions, which have significantly improved coverage compared to whole-exome sequencing, and variants in non-coding regulatory regions. In addition to previously reported pathogenic regulatory variants, we have identified a previously unreported pathogenic intronic variant in CHM in two males with choroideremia. We have also identified 19 genes not previously known to be associated with inherited retinal disease, which harbor biallelic predicted protein-truncating variants in unsolved cases. Whole-genome sequencing is an increasingly important comprehensive method with which to investigate the genetic causes of inherited retinal disease.","dc:creator":"Carss KJ","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Comprehensive Rare Variant Analysis via Whole-Genome Sequencing to Determine the Molecular Pathology of Inherited Retinal Disease."}},"rdfs:label":"W000244"},{"id":"cggv:b169c48d-ff5d-4953-ace7-7cc1408fc866","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b169c48d-ff5d-4953-ace7-7cc1408fc866_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:f1b9801f-0452-4d54-aa12-1cce8933ef52_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f1b9801f-0452-4d54-aa12-1cce8933ef52","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":41,"allele":{"id":"cggv:503e5ca8-8892-4886-a63f-c7d25bcbc1f5","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_172364.4(CACNA2D4):c.1720-74_2551+1189delinsTG","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/375308"}},"ethnicity":{"id":"cg:NotHispanicOrLatino"},"firstTestingMethod":"Whole genome shotgun sequencing","phenotypes":"obo:HP_0000512","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:ddb7b6f0-523d-4448-ac55-86beae8ce48d_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:503e5ca8-8892-4886-a63f-c7d25bcbc1f5"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26560832"},"rdfs:label":"Proband 2"},{"id":"cggv:ddb7b6f0-523d-4448-ac55-86beae8ce48d","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ddb7b6f0-523d-4448-ac55-86beae8ce48d_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:2f341a0d-2368-4b97-a48d-d7a26fcb2573_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2f341a0d-2368-4b97-a48d-d7a26fcb2573","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":42,"allele":{"id":"cggv:79eb275d-74a5-4e29-911f-b87e48320245","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_172364.5(CACNA2D4):c.2120G>A (p.Arg707His)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA6386841"}},"detectionMethod":"The authors of the study developed a panel for targeted DNA capture and sequencing by selecting 164 known IRD-related genes from RetNet and OMIM, 88 possible candidate genes and 32 abundant retinal miRNAs.
