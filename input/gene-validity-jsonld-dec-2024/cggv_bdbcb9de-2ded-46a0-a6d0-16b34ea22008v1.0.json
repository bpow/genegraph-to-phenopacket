We describe a syndrome of congenital microcephaly and diverse defects in cerebral cortical architecture. Genome-wide linkage analysis in two families identified a 7.5-Mb locus on chromosome 19q13.12 containing 148 genes. Targeted high throughput sequence analysis of linked genes in each family yielded > 4,000 DNA variants and implicated a single gene, WDR62, as harboring potentially deleterious changes. We subsequently identified additional WDR62 mutations in four other families. Magnetic resonance imaging and postmortem brain analysis supports important roles for WDR62 in the proliferation and migration of neuronal precursors. WDR62 is a WD40 repeat-containing protein expressed in neuronal precursors as well as in postmitotic neurons in the developing brain and localizes to the spindle poles of dividing cells. The diverse phenotypes of WDR62 suggest it has central roles in many aspects of cerebral cortical development.","dc:creator":"Yu TW","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"Mutations in WDR62, encoding a centrosome-associated protein, cause microcephaly with simplified gyri and abnormal cortical architecture."}},"rdfs:label":"LIS-2602"},{"id":"cggv:4d7f31bb-f9dc-468d-ba2d-6cb9e0cc85ea","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:4d7f31bb-f9dc-468d-ba2d-6cb9e0cc85ea_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Individual is in a consanguineous family."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:f75dd4f2-3df8-4b24-ab46-21ff91fffb15_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f75dd4f2-3df8-4b24-ab46-21ff91fffb15","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:ea12220d-8f7f-441f-b1f3-785e9a73c92f","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"XR_001753671.1(WDR62):n.1134+1G>A","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA405432411"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Linkage analysis","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0000218","obo:HP_0000252","obo:HP_0032012","obo:HP_0001250"],"secondTestingMethod":"PCR","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:cd453e65-e29a-47c8-acd8-71b1831e84cb_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:ea12220d-8f7f-441f-b1f3-785e9a73c92f"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20890278"},"rdfs:label":"LIS-2501"},{"id":"cggv:cd453e65-e29a-47c8-acd8-71b1831e84cb","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:cd453e65-e29a-47c8-acd8-71b1831e84cb_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Individual is in a consanguineous family."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:bc1715ae-f0c9-4ed2-8cd8-206ce5b4f721_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:bc1715ae-f0c9-4ed2-8cd8-206ce5b4f721","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","allele":{"id":"cggv:9fbe282b-0b8e-4170-8ebf-0cf4871f1a99","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001083961.2(WDR62):c.363del (p.Asp122MetfsTer5)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA259978"}},"phenotypes":"obo:HP_0000340","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:04c9033c-d9e7-4db4-90e1-239ecca5a23d_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:9fbe282b-0b8e-4170-8ebf-0cf4871f1a99"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20890278"},"rdfs:label":"LIS-903"},{"id":"cggv:04c9033c-d9e7-4db4-90e1-239ecca5a23d","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:04c9033c-d9e7-4db4-90e1-239ecca5a23d_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Individual is in a consanguineous family."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:d06fa453-a134-4c47-a84e-5ef53fc4ce15_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d06fa453-a134-4c47-a84e-5ef53fc4ce15","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":10,"allele":{"id":"cggv:a1b2ce93-f637-4334-af4c-2d39ba876c1f","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001083961.2(WDR62):c.3839_3855del (p.Gly1280AlafsTer21)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA251365"}},"detectionMethod":".

An understanding of the molecular mechanisms guiding these intricate processes is in its infancy, substantially driven by the discovery of rare mutations that cause malformations of cortical development. Mapping of disease loci in putative Mendelian forms of malformations of cortical development has been hindered by marked locus heterogeneity, small kindred sizes and diagnostic classifications that may not reflect molecular pathogenesis. Here we demonstrate the use of whole-exome sequencing to overcome these obstacles by identifying recessive mutations in WD repeat domain 62 (WDR62) as the cause of a wide spectrum of severe cerebral cortical malformations including microcephaly, pachygyria with cortical thickening as well as hypoplasia of the corpus callosum. Some patients with mutations in WDR62 had evidence of additional abnormalities including lissencephaly, schizencephaly, polymicrogyria and, in one instance, cerebellar hypoplasia, all traits traditionally regarded as distinct entities. In mice and humans, WDR62 transcripts and protein are enriched in neural progenitors within the ventricular and subventricular zones. Expression of WDR62 in the neocortex is transient, spanning the period of embryonic neurogenesis. Unlike other known microcephaly genes, WDR62 does not apparently associate with centrosomes and is predominantly nuclear in localization. These findings unify previously disparate aspects of cerebral cortical development and highlight the use of whole-exome sequencing to identify disease loci in settings in which traditional methods have proved challenging.","dc:creator":"Bilgüvar K","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"Whole-exome sequencing identifies recessive WDR62 mutations in severe brain malformations."}},"rdfs:label":"NG 339-1"},{"id":"cggv:b75ed1ca-ef53-48eb-b5e3-8db1cabc6a60","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b75ed1ca-ef53-48eb-b5e3-8db1cabc6a60_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Individual is from a consanguineous family."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:095f66e0-4a1b-457e-89fa-c439b7a8c2dd_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:095f66e0-4a1b-457e-89fa-c439b7a8c2dd","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":2,"allele":{"id":"cggv:9c2456ac-c284-4279-8a63-26753c9631e8","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001083961.2(WDR62):c.4205_4208del (p.Val1402GlyfsTer12)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA251360"}},"detectionMethod":".

However, the underlying mechanism is unclear. Here, we investigate the function of WDR62 in brain development and the pathological role of WDR62 mutations. We find that WDR62 knockdown leads to premature differentiation of neural progenitor cells (NPCs). The defect can be rescued by wild-type human WDR62, but not by the five MCPH-associated WDR62 mutants. We demonstrate that WDR62 acts upstream of JNK signaling in the control of neurogenesis. Depletion of JNK1 and WDR62 incurs very similar defects including abnormal spindle formation and mitotic division of NPCs as well as premature NPC differentiation during cortical development. Thus, our findings indicate that WDR62 is required for proper neurogenesis via JNK1 and provide an insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying MCPH pathogenesis.

Disruption of the mouse ortholog results in microcephaly underlain by reduced proliferation of neocortical progenitors during late neurogenesis, abnormalities in asymmetric centrosome inheritance leading to neuronal migration delays, and altered neuronal differentiation. Spindle pole localization of WDR62 and mitotic progression are defective in patient-derived fibroblasts, which, similar to mouse neocortical progenitors, transiently arrest at prometaphase. Expression of WDR62 is closely correlated with components of the chromosome passenger complex (CPC), a key regulator of mitosis. Wild type WDR62, but not disease-associated mutant forms, interacts with the CPC core enzyme Aurora kinase B and staining of CPC components at centromeres is altered in patient-derived fibroblasts. Our findings demonstrate critical and diverse functions of WDR62 in neocortical development and provide insight into the mechanisms by which its disruption leads to a plethora of structural abnormalities.","dc:creator":"Sgourdou P","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Disruptions in asymmetric centrosome inheritance and WDR62-Aurora kinase B interactions in primary microcephaly."},"rdfs:label":"Patient-Derived Fibroblast"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalAlterationEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:bdbcb9de-2ded-46a0-a6d0-16b34ea22008_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:248fb5bd-00c9-446f-82e8-4b2b5a89c0ab","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:48230bc8-7bd9-4d86-b9fa-d2ca3d54f5d6","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:PhenotypeRescue"},"dc:description":"WT WDR62 rescued the phenotype in a dose-dependent manner.

At least 8 variants (splicing, nonsense, and frameshift) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 8 probands in 2 publications (PMIDs: 20729831, 20890278). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 2 additional family members. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) and experimental evidence (6 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism for disease is loss of function. This gene-disease association is supported by animal models, in vitro functional assays, expression studies, and a rescue study. In summary, WDR62 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive primary microcephaly.
