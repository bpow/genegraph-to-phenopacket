Two unrelated CDGS type II patients are shown to have point mutations (one patient having Ser-->Phe and the other having His-->Arg) in the catalytic domain of the gene MGAT2, encoding UDP-GlcNAc:alpha-6-D-mannoside beta-1,2-N- acetylglucosaminyltransferase II (GnT II), an enzyme essential for biosynthesis of complex Asn-linked glycans. Both mutations caused both decreased expression of enzyme protein in a baculovirus/insect cell system and inactivation of enzyme activity. Restriction-endonuclease analysis of DNA from 23 blood relatives of one of these patients showed that 13 donors were heterozygotes; the other relatives and 21 unrelated donors were normal homozygotes. All heterozygotes showed a significant reduction (33%-68%) in mononuclear-cell GnT II activity.

GlcNAcT-II is essential for the synthesis of complex N-glycans. The Mgat2-null mice were studied in a comparison with the symptoms of congenital disorder of glycosylation type IIa (CDG-IIa) in humans. Mutant mouse tissues were shown to be deficient in GlcNAcT-II enzyme activity and complex N-glycan synthesis, resulting in severe gastrointestinal, hematologic and osteogenic abnormalities. All mutant mice died in early post-natal development. However, crossing the Mgat2 mutation into a distinct genetic background resulted in a low frequency of survivors exhibiting additional and novel disease signs of CDG-IIa. Analysis of N-glycan structures in the kidneys of Mgat2-null mice showed a novel bisected hybrid N-glycan structure in which the bisecting GlcNAc residue was substituted with a beta1,4-linked galactose or the Lewis(x) structure. These studies suggest that some of the functions of complex N-glycan branches are conserved in mammals and that human disease due to aberrant protein N-glycosylation may be modeled in the mouse, with the expectation in this case of gaining insights into CDG-IIa disease pathogenesis. Further analyses of the Mgat2-deficient phenotype in the mouse have been accomplished involving cells in which the Mgat2 gene is dispensable, as well as other cell lineages in which a severe defect is present.

Frequency of CDGs is unknown since most cases are believed to be misdiagnosed or unrecognized. With few patients identified and heterogeneity in disease signs noted, studies of animal models may provide increased understanding of pathogenic mechanisms. However, features of mammalian glycan biosynthesis and species-specific variations in glycan repertoires have cast doubt on whether animal models of human genetic defects in protein glycosylation will reproduce pathogenic events and disease signs. We have introduced a mutation into the mouse germline that recapitulates the glycan biosynthetic defect responsible for human CDG type IIa (CDG-IIa). Mice lacking the Mgat2 gene were deficient in GlcNAcT-II glycosyltransferase activity and complex N-glycans, resulting in severe gastrointestinal, hematologic, and osteogenic abnormalities. With use of a lectin-based diagnostic screen for CDG-IIa, we found that all Mgat2-null mice died in early postnatal development. However, crossing the Mgat2 mutation into a distinct genetic background resulted in a low frequency of survivors. Mice deficient in complex N-glycans exhibited most CDG-IIa disease signs; however, some signs were unique to the aged mouse or are prognostic in human CDG-IIa. Unexpectedly, analyses of N-glycan structures in Mgat2-null mice revealed a novel oligosaccharide branch on the \"bisecting\" N-acetylglucosamine. These genetic, biochemical, and physiologic studies indicate conserved functions for N-glycan branches produced in the Golgi apparatus among two mammalian species and suggest possible therapeutic approaches to GlcNAcT-II deficiency. Our findings indicate that human genetic disease due to aberrant protein glycosylation can be modeled in the mouse to gain insights into N-glycan-dependent physiology and the pathogenesis of CDG-IIa.","dc:creator":"Wang Y","dc:date":"2001","dc:title":"Modeling human congenital disorder of glycosylation type IIa in the mouse: conservation of asparagine-linked glycan-dependent functions in mammalian physiology and insights into disease pathogenesis."},"rdfs:label":"Wang Knockout Mouse"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:81725d9b-41c4-427b-b386-5d160d71510e","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:44059ccc-c045-4d15-8167-7927746132f1","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Immune deficiency has been seen in one published patient with MGAT2-CDG.

Moreover, N-glycan branching has been demonstrated to change as a function of infection and inflammation. Our previous findings suggest that complex-type N-glycans on the class II major histocompatibility complex play an important role in antigen selection within antigen presenting cells (APCs) such that highly branched N-glycans promote polysaccharide (glycoantigen, GlyAg) presentation following Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2)-dependent antigen processing. In order to explore the impact of N-glycan branching on the myeloid-derived APC population without the confounding problems of altering the branching of lymphocytes and non-hematopoietic cells, we created a novel myeloid-specific knockout of the β-1,2-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase II (Mgat2) enzyme. Using this novel mouse, we found that the reduction in multi-antennary N-glycans characteristic of Mgat2 ablation had no impact on GlyAg-mediated TLR2 signaling. Likewise, no deficits in antigen uptake or cellular homing to lymph nodes were found. However, we discovered that Mgat2 ablation prevented GlyAg presentation and T cell activation in vitro and in vivo without apparent alterations in protein antigen response or myeloid-mediated protection from infection. These findings demonstrate that GlyAg presentation can be regulated by the N-glycan branching pattern of APCs, thereby establishing an in vivo model where the T cell-dependent activity of GlyAgs can be experimentally distinguished from GlyAg-mediated stimulation of the innate response through TLR2.","dc:creator":"Ryan SO","dc:date":"2014","dc:title":"Mgat2 ablation in the myeloid lineage leads to

Our study provides comprehensive epidemiologic information and prevalence figures for each of these CDG in a large cohort of congenital disorder of glycosylation patients.","dc:creator":"Alsubhi S","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Congenital disorders of glycosylation: The Saudi experience."}},"rdfs:label":"Alsubhi Proband 1"},{"id":"cggv:e2742874-40bd-4c33-8808-c7bb18da4c98","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e2742874-40bd-4c33-8808-c7bb18da4c98_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:2608de0c-488f-4bdb-b2fa-4464f82b574c_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2608de0c-488f-4bdb-b2fa-4464f82b574c","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":3,"allele":{"id":"cggv:2a1805ff-0fa5-4b49-a558-21c893d24e73","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_002408.4(MGAT2):c.869C>T (p.Ser290Phe)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA254036"}},"detectionMethod":"Pharmacia ALF sequencer","firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypeFreeText":"widely spaced nipples, normal deep tendon reflexes","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0012301","obo:HP_0003160","obo:HP_0000280","obo:HP_0001263","obo:HP_0001629","obo:HP_0000369","obo:HP_0001252","obo:HP_0012171","obo:HP_0001999","obo:HP_0011344"],"previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"Serum isoelectric focusing showed CDG type II pattern, fibroblasts extracts showed <2% activity of GnT II","secondTestingMethod":"Restriction digest","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:253d4b14-2f4e-4dc9-8b19-3d83b6faf852_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:2a1805ff-0fa5-4b49-a558-21c893d24e73"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8808595"},"rdfs:label":"Tan Patient A"},{"id":"cggv:253d4b14-2f4e-4dc9-8b19-3d83b6faf852","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:253d4b14-2f4e-4dc9-8b19-3d83b6faf852_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:253d4b14-2f4e-4dc9-8b19-3d83b6faf852_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Sf9 cells transfected with the variant showed no GnT II activity"}],"strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:2dacef35-78d5-4428-a8bd-087cb9d52d41_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2dacef35-78d5-4428-a8bd-087cb9d52d41","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":4,"allele":{"id":"cggv:c8b3d067-2219-45e2-bc7f-0faa6b8bec42","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_002408.4(MGAT2):c.1006_1009del (p.Asp336LeufsTer17)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA7172629"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Homozygosity mapping","phenotypeFreeText":"hook nose, widely spaced nipples","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0031381","obo:HP_0012301","obo:HP_0000369","obo:HP_0001252","obo:HP_0000316","obo:HP_0000268","obo:HP_0009765","obo:HP_0000358","obo:HP_0001250","obo:HP_0004315","obo:HP_0001929","obo:HP_0003186","obo:HP_0011968","obo:HP_0002557","obo:HP_0002808"],"previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"Abnormal carbohydrate-deficient transferrin profile (type II), abnormal serum N-glycan profiling","secondTestingMethod":"Next generation sequencing panels","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:30d353f8-3f63-4dde-9ca7-52f1e8ef698b_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:c8b3d067-2219-45e2-bc7f-0faa6b8bec42"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33044030","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Glycosylation is a critical post/peri-translational modification required for the appropriate development and function of the immune system. As an example, abnormalities in glycosylation can cause antibody deficiency and reduced lymphocyte signaling, although the phenotype can be complex given the diverse roles of glycosylation. Human MGAT2 encodes N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase II, which is a critical enzyme in the processing of oligomannose to complex N-glycans. Complex N-glycans are essential for immune system functionality, but only one individual with MGAT2-CDG has been described to have an abnormal immunologic evaluation. MGAT2-CDG (CDG-IIa) is a congenital disorder of glycosylation (CDG) associated with profound global developmental disability, hypotonia, early onset epilepsy, and other multisystem manifestations. Here, we report a 4-year old female with MGAT2-CDG due to a novel homozygous pathogenic variant in MGAT2, a 4-base pair deletion, c.1006_1009delGACA. In addition to clinical features previously described in MGAT2-CDG, she experienced episodic asystole, persistent hypogammaglobulinemia, and defective ex vivo mitogen and antigen proliferative responses, but intact specific vaccine antibody titers. Her infection history has been mild despite the testing abnormalities. We compare this patient to the 15 previously reported patients in the literature, thus expanding both the genotypic and phenotypic spectrum for MGAT2-CDG.","dc:creator":"Poskanzer SA","dc:date":"2021","dc:title":"Immune dysfunction in MGAT2-CDG: A clinical report and review of the literature."}},"rdfs:label":"Poskanzer Proband"},{"id":"cggv:30d353f8-3f63-4dde-9ca7-52f1e8ef698b","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:30d353f8-3f63-4dde-9ca7-52f1e8ef698b_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Downgraded for not expected to undergo NMD."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:0f102eea-b0af-4715-8644-d20f504e027c_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0f102eea-b0af-4715-8644-d20f504e027c","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDiagnosis","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":92,"allele":{"id":"cggv:50f137f8-d970-4442-918d-8433a8193e9d","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_002408.4(MGAT2):c.146del (p.Gly49ValfsTer?)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA2624726666"}},"detectionMethod":"Retrospective screening of cohort of patients who were diagnosed with CDG after molecular testing, but who did not receive a clinical or laboratory-based diagnosis.","firstTestingMethod":"Next generation sequencing panels","phenotypeFreeText":"thin lips","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0002240","obo:HP_0001763","obo:HP_0002910"],"sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:75579c37-35c9-4cc5-9f3b-fcabbc51c18d_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:50f137f8-d970-4442-918d-8433a8193e9d"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33960646","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"The pathophysiology of congenital defects of glycosylation (CDG) is complex and the diagnosis has been a challenge because of the overlapping clinical signs and symptoms as well as a large number of disorders. Isoelectric focusing of transferrin has been used as a screening method but has limitations. Individual enzyme or molecular genetic tests have been difficult to perform. In this study, we aimed to describe CDG patients who were referred to from different departments either without a preliminary diagnosis or suspected to have a genetic disorder other than CDG. The patients were diagnosed mainly with a 450 gene next-generation DNA sequencing panel for inborn errors of metabolism, which also included 25 genes for CDG. A total of 862 patients were investigated with the panel, whereby homozygous (10) or compound heterozygous (4) mutations were found in a total of 14 (1.6%) patients. A total of 13 different mutations were discovered, 10 of them being novel. Interestingly, none of the patients was suspected to have a CDG before referral. This report expands the clinical/laboratory findings in patients with CDG and stresses on the fact that CDG should be in the differential list for pediatric patients presented with nonspecific dysmorphic features and neurological delays/regression. Also, next-generation DNA sequencing with panel approach was noticed to have a significant diagnostic potential in patients presented with nonspecific neurologic and dysmorphic findings.","dc:creator":"İnci A","dc:date":"2021","dc:title":"Congenital defects of glycosylation: Novel presentations with mainly neurological involvement and variable dysmorphic features."}},"rdfs:label":"Inci proband"},{"id":"cggv:75579c37-35c9-4cc5-9f3b-fcabbc51c18d","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:75579c37-35c9-4cc5-9f3b-fcabbc51c18d_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.25,"dc:description":"Reduced for consanguinity without lab testing, for very little phenotype information, and for not expected to undergo NMD.
