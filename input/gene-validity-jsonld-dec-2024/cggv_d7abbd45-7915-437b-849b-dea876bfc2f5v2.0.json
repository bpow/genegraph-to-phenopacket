In addition to these major symptoms, WS type 4 is associated with Hirschsprung disease. To date, three genes responsible for WS4 have been cloned: genes for a transcription factor SOX10, endothelin 3 (EDN3), and endothelin B receptor (EDNRB). We here describe a novel mutant mouse with a mutation of the Ednrb gene, and propose the mouse as an animal model of WS4. These mutants are with mixed genetic background of BALB/c and MSM (an inbred strain of Japanese wild mice) and have extensive white spotting. They died between 2 and 7 weeks after birth owing to megacolon: their colon distal to the megacolon lacked Auerbach's plexus cells. Interestingly, these mutants did not respond to sound, and the stria vascularis of their cochlea lacked intermediate cells, i.e., neural crest-derived melanocytes. Since these symptoms resembled those of human WS4 and were transmitted in autosomal recessive hereditary manner, the mutants were named WS4 mice. Breeding analysis revealed that WS4 mice are allelic with piebald-lethal and JF1 mice, which are also mutated in the Ednrb gene. Mutation analysis revealed that their Ednrb lacked 318 nucleotides encoding Ednrb transmembrane domains owing to deletion of exons 2 and 3. Interaction between endothelin 3 and its receptor is required for normal differentiation and development of melanocytes and Auerbach's plexus cells. We concluded that a missing interaction here led to a lack of these cells, which caused pigmentation anomaly, deafness, and megacolon in WS4 mice.","dc:creator":"Matsushima Y","dc:date":"2002","dc:title":"A mouse model of Waardenburg syndrome type 4 with a new spontaneous mutation of the endothelin-B receptor gene."},"rdfs:label":"Matsushima Mouse Model 1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:f13a6092-977e-449d-9f8d-57c440d9b86e","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:67c39582-824d-4dd0-94dd-adf03036f0b3","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Ednrb-/- (homozygous null) mice had severe congenital hearing loss, however other phenotypes of Waardenburg syndrome type 4A were not mentioned.

Hearing loss in Waardenburg-Shah syndrome has been thought to be caused by an Ednrb-mediated congenital defect of melanocytes in the stria vascularis (SV) of inner ears. Here we show that Ednrb expressed in spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) in inner ears is required for postnatal development of hearing in mice. Ednrb protein was expressed in SGNs from WT mice on postnatal day 19 (P19), whereas it was undetectable in SGNs from WT mice on P3. Correspondingly, Ednrb homozygously deleted mice (Ednrb(-/-) mice) with congenital hearing loss showed degeneration of SGNs on P19 but not on P3. The congenital hearing loss involving neurodegeneration of SGNs as well as megacolon disease in Ednrb(-/-) mice were markedly improved by introducing an Ednrb transgene under control of the dopamine β-hydroxylase promoter (Ednrb(-/-);DBH-Ednrb mice) on P19. Neither defects of melanocytes nor hypopigmentation in the SV and skin in Ednrb(-/-) mice was rescued in the Ednrb(-/-);DBH-Ednrb mice.

This condition is associated with sensorineural hearing loss; atypical pigmentation of the hair, skin, and eyes; and Hirschsprung’s disease (aganglionic megacolon). Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, the following disease entities have been split: autosomal recessive Waardenburg syndrome Type 4A and autosomal dominant Waardenburg syndrome type 4A (OMIM # for both entities: 277580). The split curation for autosomal dominant Waardenburg Syndrome Type 4A has been curated separately. Five variants (missense) that have been reported in five probands in five publications (PMIDs: 16237557, 21373256, 25852447, 28502583, 30394532) are included in this curation. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss-of-function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence (knockout mouse models; PMIDs: 11773966, 23360229, 21715336). In summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. This gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the Hearing Loss GCEP on 5/8/2018. It was re-evaluated on 6/27/2023. As a result of this reevaluation, the classification did not change, although additional genetic evidence was added (PMID: 30394532). While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hearing Loss GCEP on the meeting date 6/27/2023 (SOP Version 9). \nThe experts of the Hearing Loss GCEP approved this curation as Moderate, due to convincing available data. Also, the total genetic evidence score is actually 0.8, not 1.0 (two of the variants (p.Ser342Ile and p.Asn378Ser) were downgraded from 0.2 to 0.1 due to consanguinity).
