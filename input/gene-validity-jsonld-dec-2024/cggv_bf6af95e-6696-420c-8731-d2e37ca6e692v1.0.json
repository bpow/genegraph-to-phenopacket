CG8 is one of the more common of these and is associated with varying phenotypes, ranging from the most severe, Zellweger syndrome (ZS), to the milder neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy (NALD) and infantile Refsum disease (IRD). PEX26, encoding the 305-amino-acid membrane peroxin, has been shown to be deficient in CG8. We studied the PEX26 genotype in fibroblasts of eight CG8 patients--four with the ZS phenotype, two with NALD, and two with IRD. Catalase was mostly cytosolic in all these cell lines, but import of the proteins that contained PTS1, the SKL peroxisome targeting sequence, was normal. Expression of PEX26 reestablished peroxisomes in all eight cell lines, confirming that PEX26 defects are pathogenic in CG8 patients. When cells were cultured at 30 degrees C, catalase import was restored in the cell lines from patients with the NALD and IRD phenotypes, but to a much lesser extent in those with the ZS phenotype, indicating that temperature sensitivity varied inversely with the severity of the clinical phenotype. Several types of mutations were identified, including homozygous G89R mutations in two patients with ZS. Expression of these PEX26 mutations in pex26 Chinese hamster ovary cells resulted in cell phenotypes similar to those in the human cell lines. These findings confirm that the degree of temperature sensitivity in pex26 cell lines is predictive of the clinical phenotype in patients with PEX26 deficiency.","dc:creator":"Matsumoto N","dc:date":"2003","dc:title":"Mutations in novel peroxin gene PEX26 that cause peroxisome-biogenesis disorders of complementation group 8 provide a genotype-phenotype correlation."},"rdfs:label":"Northern blot"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Northern blot showed highest level of PEX26 expression in kidney, relatively high in liver, brain, and skeletal muscle"},{"id":"cggv:8e79f507-a416-4d1c-a0a0-7100a0757f17","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:55670fa6-7ee0-422b-b21f-69784c0ff101","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"obo:MI_0915"},"dc:description":"PEX26 fragments mislocalized to nucleus (HAnls-PEX26) transformed into fibroblasts from PBD400 (PEX3 deficient patient, lacks peroxisomes), results show that aas 29-163 of PEX26 are required for the interaction with PEX6 (Fig. 6)","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15858711","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Matsumoto and colleagues recently identified PEX26 as the gene responsible for complementation group 8 of the peroxisome biogenesis disorders and showed that it encodes an integral peroxisomal membrane protein with a single C-terminal transmembrane domain and a cytosolic N-terminus that interacts with the PEX1/PEX6 heterodimer through direct binding to the latter. They proposed that PEX26 functions as the peroxisomal docking factor for the PEX1/PEX6 heterodimer. Here, we identify new PEX26 disease alleles, localize the PEX6-binding domain to the N-terminal half of the protein (aa 29-174), and show that, at the cellular level, PEX26 deficiency impairs peroxisomal import of both PTS1- and PTS2-targeted matrix proteins. Also, we find that PEX26 undergoes alternative splicing to produce several splice forms--including one, PEX26- delta ex5, that maintains frame and encodes an isoform lacking the transmembrane domain of full-length PEX26 (PEX26-FL). Despite its cytosolic location, PEX26- delta ex5 rescues peroxisome biogenesis in PEX26-deficient cells as efficiently as does PEX26-FL. To test our observation that a peroxisomal location is not required for PEX26 function, we made a chimeric protein (PEX26-Mito) with PEX26 as its N-terminus and the targeting segment of a mitochondrial outer membrane protein (OMP25) at its C-terminus. We found PEX26-Mito localized to the mitochondria and directed all detectable PEX6 and a fraction of PEX1 to this extraperoxisomal location; yet PEX26-Mito retains the full ability to rescue peroxisome biogenesis in PEX26-deficient cells. On the basis of these observations, we suggest that a peroxisomal localization of PEX26 and PEX6 is not required for their function and that the interaction of PEX6 with PEX1 is dynamic. This model predicts that, once activated in an extraperoxisomal location, PEX1 moves to the peroxisome and completes the function of the PEX1/6 heterodimer.","dc:creator":"Weller S","dc:date":"2005","dc:title":"Alternative splicing suggests extended function of PEX26 in peroxisome biogenesis."},"rdfs:label":"Mapping of PEX6 Binding in PEX26"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Additional evidence for interaction scored in PMID:12717447"},{"id":"cggv:1db167e9-5f2b-4eea-b21f-b2eb7f324b25","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9888583d-8bbb-4a07-ab22-e76e0e7b860c","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"obo:MI_0915"},"dc:description":"ZP167 cells transfected with Flag-Pex26 expressed with Pex1-HA, Pex1-HA was detected with pattern that was superimposed with Flag-Pex26 with cells expressing Flag-Pex26, Pex6, and Pex1-Ha (Fig. 3e and j)\n\nCo-IP of lysates from HEK293 cells resulted in co-precipitation of PEX26 with PEX6, along with PEX1, suggesting the formation of a complex","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12717447","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Peroxisomes are ubiquitous organelles with a single membrane that contain over 50 different enzymes that catalyse various metabolic pathways, including beta-oxidation and lipid synthesis.

Expression of PEX26 restores peroxisomal protein import in the fibroblasts of an individual with PBD of CG8. This individual possesses a homozygous, inactivating pathogenic point mutation, Arg98Trp, in Pex26. Pex6 and Pex1 of the AAA ATPase family co-immunoprecipitate with Pex26. Epitope-tagged Pex6 and Pex1 are discernible as puncta in normal CHO-K1 cells, but not in PEX26-defective cells. PEX26 expression in ZP167 cells re-establishes colocalization of Pex6 and Pex1 with Pex26, in a Pex6-dependent manner.

Identification of the precise genetic defect is important, however, to permit carrier testing and early prenatal diagnosis. Molecular analysis is likely to expand the clinical spectrum of PBD and may also provide data relevant to prognosis and future therapeutic intervention. However, the large number of genes involved has thus far impeded rapid mutation identification. In response, we developed the PEX Gene Screen, an algorithm for the systematic screening of exons in the six PEX genes most commonly defective in PBD-ZSS. We used PCR amplification of genomic DNA and sequencing to screen 91 unclassified PBD-ZSS patients for mutations in PEX1, PEX26, PEX6, PEX12, PEX10, and PEX2. A maximum of 14 reactions per patient identified pathological mutations in 79% and both mutant alleles in 54%. Twenty-five novel mutations were identified overall. The proportion of patients with different PEX gene defects correlated with frequencies previously identified by complementation analysis.

clinical exome sequencing (ES), we identified an autosomal recessive missense variant, c.153C>A (p.F51L), in the peroxisome biogenesis factor 26 gene (PEX26) in a 19-yr-old female of Ashkenazi Jewish descent who was referred for moderate to severe hearing loss. The proband and three affected siblings are all homozygous for the c.153C>A variant. Skin fibroblasts from this patient show normal morphology in immunostaining of matrix proteins, although the level of catalase was elevated. Import rate of matrix proteins was significantly decreased in the patient-derived fibroblasts. Binding of Pex26-F51L to the AAA ATPase peroxins, Pex1 and Pex6, is severely impaired and affects peroxisome assembly. Moreover, Pex26 in the patient's fibroblasts is reduced to ∼30% of the control, suggesting that Pex26-F51L is unstable in cells. In the patient's fibroblasts, peroxisome-targeting signal 1 (PTS1) proteins, PTS2 protein 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase, and catalase are present in a punctate staining pattern at 37°C and in a diffuse pattern at 42°C, suggesting that these matrix proteins are not imported to peroxisomes in a temperature-sensitive manner. Analysis of peroxisomal metabolism in the patient's fibroblasts showed that the level of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (C22:6n-3) in ether phospholipids is decreased, whereas other lipid metabolism, including peroxisomal fatty acid β-oxidation, is normal. Collectively, the functional data support the mild phenotype of nonsyndromic hearing loss in patients harboring the F51L variant in PEX26.","dc:creator":"Tanaka AJ","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"A newly identified mutation in the PEX26 gene is associated with a milder form of Zellweger spectrum disorder."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30446579","rdfs:label":"II-3"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"gnomAD frequency = 0.00003282\n\n immunofluorescence microscopy of control and proband (PEX26-F51L) fibroblasts showed peroxisomal localization of catalase, PTS1 proteins, Aox, and ADAPS (Fig. 2)\n\nImmunoblot analysis of of PEX26-F51L fibroblasts suggested normal peroxisomal protein import of both PTS1 and PTS2 proteins (Fig. 3), however catalase was elevated in Pex26-F51L fibroblasts and Pex26 protein levels were reduced to 30% of control fibroblasts suggesting that the variant reduces the stability of Pex26 (Fig. 3A-B)\n\nCells cultured at 42° showed less efficient import of matrix proteins in Pex26-F51L cells, suggesting a temperature sensitive phenotype (Fig. 4A), these cells also had hardly detectable mutant protein (fig. 4B)\n\nFlag-tagged Pex26-F51L expressed with Pex1-HA and Pex6-HA in CHO pex26 ZP167 cells, this showed that Pex26-F51L was expressed at a lower level than WT flag-PEX26 (Fig. 6) and when immunoprecipitated, Pex1-HA and Pex6-HA were hardly discernible from the the immunoprecipitates of Flag-Pex26-F51L suggesting that the mutant protein does not efficiently recruit the Pex1-Pex6 complex to peroxisomes (Fig. 6)\n\nPex26-F51L and control phospholipids analyzed via LC-MS/MS showed normal VLCFA-containing phosphatidylcholine and degradation activity by beta-oxidation of lignoceric acid compared to controls, while total amount of DHA-PLs was reduced in Pex26-F51L fibroblasts leading to decrease in DHA-containing ether phospholipids (Fig. 7D-E)"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalRecessiveVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":108,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria7","strengthScore":14.5,"subject":{"id":"cggv:c9dddda1-d798-4259-adc5-2679cd4a1d44","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0019234","gene":"hgnc:22965","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"PEX26 was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive peroxisomal biogenesis disorder in 2003 (Matsumoto et al., PMID: 12851857).

Variants (nonsense, missense, and frameshift) in this gene have been reported in at least 12 probands in 3 publications (PMIDS: 12851857, 15542397, 15858711). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score (12) for genetic evidence has been reached. The mechanism for disease is expected to be loss of function. This gene-disease association is supported by expression studies and in vitro functional assays. In summary, PEX26 is definitively associated with autosomal recessive peroxisomal biogenesis disorder. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:bf6af95e-6696-420c-8731-d2e37ca6e692"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
