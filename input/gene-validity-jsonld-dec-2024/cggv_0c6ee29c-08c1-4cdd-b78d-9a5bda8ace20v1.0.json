Deficiencies of alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase (AGT) or glyoxylate reductase (GRHPR) are the two known causes of the disease (PH I and II, respectively). To determine the etiology of an as yet uncharacterized type of PH, we selected a cohort of 15 non-PH I/PH II patients from eight unrelated families with calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis for high-density SNP microarray analysis. We determined that mutations in an uncharacterized gene, DHDPSL, on chromosome 10 cause a third type of PH (PH III). To overcome the difficulties in data analysis attributed to a state of compound heterozygosity, we developed a strategy of \"heterozygosity mapping\"-a search for long heterozygous patterns unique to all patients in a given family and overlapping between families, followed by reconstruction of haplotypes. This approach enabled us to determine an allelic fragment shared by all patients of Ashkenazi Jewish descent and bearing a 3 bp deletion in DHDPSL. Overall, six mutations were detected: four missense mutations, one in-frame deletion, and one splice-site mutation. Our assumption is that DHDPSL is the gene encoding 4-hydroxy-2-oxoglutarate aldolase, catalyzing the final step in the metabolic pathway of hydroxyproline.","dc:creator":"Belostotsky R","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"Mutations in DHDPSL are responsible for primary hyperoxaluria type III."}},{"id":"cggv:90f3f61f-86ea-4374-893f-43be320c8ceb_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:70d3ff21-f983-4965-9b24-3fb97821697e"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20797690"}],"rdfs:label":"p.Arg70Pro & c.700+5G>T in trans "},{"id":"cggv:90f3f61f-86ea-4374-893f-43be320c8ceb","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:90f3f61f-86ea-4374-893f-43be320c8ceb_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:90f3f61f-86ea-4374-893f-43be320c8ceb_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Functional analysis showed harmful impact of mutations in that they dramatically reduce stability, impact localization, and trigger aggregation (PMID: 22771891)."}],"strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:a576c5fa-6ae9-4298-b6cc-a5295804ef9a","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a576c5fa-6ae9-4298-b6cc-a5295804ef9a_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:a576c5fa-6ae9-4298-b6cc-a5295804ef9a_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"RT-PCR analysis showed that the variant leads to a 51 bp longer product (412 bp) vs. the wild type (361 bp) (mutant extends protein by 17 amino acids) (PMID: 21896830).

More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached, The mechanism of disease appears to be loss-of-function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence (expression-level evidence; GTEx and Humphrey’s Lab expression data). A mouse model was evaluated, but was not scored as the mice lacked urinary oxalate excretion, a key part of the human phenotype. In summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between HOGA1 and autosomal recessive HP3. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Tubulopathy GCEP on the meeting date 5/30/2024 (SOP Version 10).
