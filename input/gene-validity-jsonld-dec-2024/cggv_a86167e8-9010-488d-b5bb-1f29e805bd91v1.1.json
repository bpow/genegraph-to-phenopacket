Because mutations in RYR2 or in CASQ2 are not retrieved in all CPVT cases, we searched for mutations in the physiological protein partners of RyR2 and CSQ2 in a large cohort of CPVT patients with no detected mutation in these two genes. Based on a candidate gene approach, we focused our investigations on triadin and junctin, two proteins that link RyR2 and CSQ2. Mutations in the triadin (TRDN) and in the junctin (ASPH) genes were searched in a cohort of 97 CPVT patients. We identified three mutations in triadin which cosegregated with the disease on a recessive mode of transmission in two families, but no mutation was found in junctin. Two TRDN mutations, a 4 bp deletion and a nonsense mutation, resulted in premature stop codons; the third mutation, a p.T59R missense mutation, was further studied. Expression of the p.T59R mutant in COS-7 cells resulted in intracellular retention and degradation of the mutant protein. This was confirmed after in vivo expression of the mutant triadin in triadin knock-out mice by viral transduction. In this work, we identified TRDN as a new gene responsible for an autosomal recessive form of CPVT.

The cDNAs encoding these three isoforms of triadin have been isolated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and cDNA library screening. The deduced amino acid sequences show that these proteins are identical in their N-terminal sequences, whereas the C-terminal sequences are distinct from each other and from that of skeletal muscle triadin. Based upon both the amino acid sequences and biochemical analysis, all three triadin isoforms share similar membrane topology with skeletal muscle triadin. Immunofluorescence staining of rabbit cardiac muscle with antibodies purified from the homologous region of triadin shows that cardiac triadin is primarily confined to the I-band region of cardiac myocytes, where the junctional and corbular sarcoplasmic reticulum is located. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the conserved region of the luminal domain of triadin is able to bind both the ryanodine receptor and calsequestrin in cardiac muscle.

To better understand the role of triadin 1 in excitation-contraction coupling in the heart, we generated transgenic mice with targeted overexpression of triadin 1 to mouse atrium and ventricle, employing the alpha-myosin heavy chain promoter to drive protein expression. The protein was overexpressed 5-fold in mouse ventricles, and overexpression was accompanied by cardiac hypertrophy. The levels of two other junctional SR proteins, the ryanodine receptor and junctin, were reduced by 55% and 73%, respectively, in association with triadin 1 overexpression, whereas the levels of calsequestrin, the Ca(2+)-binding protein of junctional SR, and of phospholamban and SERCA2a, Ca(2+)-handling proteins of the free SR, were unchanged. Cardiac myocytes from triadin 1-overexpressing mice exhibited depressed contractility; Ca(2+) transients decayed at a slower rate, and cell shortening and relengthening were diminished. The extent of depression of cell shortening of triadin 1-overexpressing cardiomyocytes was rate-dependent, being more depressed under low stimulation frequencies (0.5 Hz), but reaching comparable levels at higher frequencies of stimulation (5 Hz). Spontaneously beating, isolated work-performing heart preparations overexpressing triadin 1 also relaxed at a slower rate than control hearts, and failed to adapt to increased afterload appropriately. The fast time inactivation constant, tau(1), of the l-type Ca(2+) channel was prolonged in transgenic cardiomyocytes.

The structure and protein composition of the cardiac CRU is significantly altered in Trdn(-/-) hearts. jSR proteins (RyR2, Casq2, junctin, and junctophilin 1 and 2) are significantly reduced in Trdn(-/-) hearts, whereas Cav1.2 and SERCA2a remain unchanged.

Immunolabeling experiments show reduced colocalization of Cav1.2 with RyR2 and substantial Casq2 labeling outside of the jSR in Trdn(-/-) myocytes. CRU function is impaired in Trdn(-/-) myocytes, with reduced SR Ca(2+) release and impaired negative feedback of SR Ca(2+) release on Cav1.2 Ca(2+) currents (I(Ca)).

Electrophysiological experiments showed that catecholamine challenge with ISO caused premature SCR (spontaneous Calcium release) in TRDN-/- myocytes, with the Ca channel blocker nifedipine able to abolish the differences between the +/+ and -/- myocyte groups. ECGs showed ventricular extrasystoles as well as nonsustained VT in KO mice.

TRDN encodes Triadin, a protein important for calcium-release regulation from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Biallelic loss of function variants in TRDN have been described in CPVT patients in a number of studies (Roux-Buisson et al, 2012, PMID:22422768; Rooryck et al, 2015, PMID:26200674; Walsh et al, 2016, PMID:26768964), including nonsense (p.Gln205Ter, p.Glu168Ter), frameshift (c.53_56del), intronic (c.22+29A>G, with effect on splicing functionally proven) and missense (p.Thr59Arg, the mutant protein was confirmed to be degraded in COS-7 cells and after transfection into knockout mice) variants. An additional report described a homozygous deletion of TRDN exon 2 in an infant who suffered cardiac arrest and subsequent arrhythmia episodes, but this case was scored with only one point due to uncertainty about the phenotype and the additional presence of a RYR2 variant of uncertain significance in this patient (O'Callaghan et al, 2018, PMID:30479949). Biallelic truncating variants in TRDN have also been reported in patients with Long QT syndrome, and the LQTS Gene Curation Expert Panel have previously classified TRDN as having strong evidence for association with LQTS, though with an atypical LQTS phenotype. The variable and atypical phenotypes associated with so-called “Triadin knockout syndrome” should therefore be taken into account when interpreting patients with TRDN biallelic loss of function variants. The association of TRDN with CPVT is also supported by substantial experimental evidence, including expression in heart tissue (Cacheux et al, 2019, PMID:31607542), protein interaction with RYR2 and CASQ2 (Guo et al, 1996, PMID:8550602) and relevant biochemical function in regulating the contractile properties of the heart (Kirchhefer et al, 2001, PMID:11069905). Additionally, knockout mice are directly relevant to the genotypes observed in CPVT patients with TRDN variants, with several studies demonstrating a relevant CPVT phenotype in knockout mice for non-human model organism (e.g. Cacheux et al, 2019, PMID:31607542; Chopra et al, 2009, PMID:19383796) and functional alteration in non-patient cells derived from these mouse knockouts (Chopra et al, 2009, PMID:19383796). Partial rescue of the CPVT phenotype has also been observed in knockout mice treated with AAV2/9 virus encoding rat TRDN isoform Trisk32 (Cacheux et al, 2019, PMID:31607542). In summary, TRDN variants are definitively associated with autosomal recessive CPVT. Note: All CPVT genes were curated by 3 separate blinded teams. The evidence and scores reached by these 3 teams was reviewed by the CPVT Gene Curation Expert Panel (GCEP). The classification and summary presented here is the conclusion of this GCEP's analysis according to evidence teams' efforts. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia Gene Curation Expert Panel on 20th January, 2021 (SOP Version 7).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:a86167e8-9010-488d-b5bb-1f29e805bd91"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
