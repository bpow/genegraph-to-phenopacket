This has been amply documented for early-onset cognitive impairment, or intellectual disability, one of the most complex disorders known and a very important health care problem worldwide. More than 90 different gene defects have been identified for X-chromosome-linked intellectual disability alone, but research into the more frequent autosomal forms of intellectual disability is still in its infancy. To expedite the molecular elucidation of autosomal-recessive intellectual disability, we have now performed homozygosity mapping, exon enrichment and next-generation sequencing in 136 consanguineous families with autosomal-recessive intellectual disability from Iran and elsewhere. This study, the largest published so far, has revealed additional mutations in 23 genes previously implicated in intellectual disability or related neurological disorders, as well as single, probably disease-causing variants in 50 novel candidate genes. Proteins encoded by several of these genes interact directly with products of known intellectual disability genes, and many are involved in fundamental cellular processes such as transcription and translation, cell-cycle control, energy metabolism and fatty-acid synthesis, which seem to be pivotal for normal brain development and function.","dc:creator":"Najmabadi H","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"Deep sequencing reveals 50 novel genes for recessive cognitive disorders."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:18885d8b-bd77-4386-a046-e39b7a9c4685_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2025512f-f800-4ca9-b302-f948a3c73cc3_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:2025512f-f800-4ca9-b302-f948a3c73cc3","type":"Proband","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":14,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:a2889ed0-d29c-4f65-b138-277030a8e7b5","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001040616.3(LINS1):c.1096G>T (p.Glu366Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA393935496"}},{"id":"cggv:ad558a4f-d11f-47c9-a5c9-3029c177193d","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001040616.3(LINS1):c.1178T>G (p.Leu393Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA7759514"}}],"phenotypes":["obo:HP_0002194","obo:HP_0002307","obo:HP_0002015","obo:HP_0002300"],"sex":"Male","variant":[{"id":"cggv:d0b9d991-b6a5-4454-88d0-b71b14d1b8b3_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:ad558a4f-d11f-47c9-a5c9-3029c177193d"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30090841","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Worster-Drought syndrome is a congenital, pseudobulbar paresis.

Common phenotypes for individuals with *LINS1* variants include intellectual disability, autistic features, hyperactive behavior, stereotypical movements, and mutism. Additionally, some patients exhibited muscular hypotonia, schizophrenia, anxiety, and features of Worster-Drought syndrome (described as a form of cerebral palsy affecting muscles of the mouth and throat) including drooling, dysphagia, and impaired tongue movement. Given the spectrum of neurodevelopmental features observed, the gene is curated under “complex neurodevelopmental disorder” (http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0100038).\nEight homozygous variants of various types (frameshift (2), nonsense (4), splicing (1), and missense (1)), reported in 15 individuals in seven publications have been included in this curation (PMIDs: 21937992, 23773660, 28181389, 30090841, 32802957, 32499722, 34450347). The presumed mechanism of pathogenicity based on published evidence is loss of function. The maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. In summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between *LINS1* and autosomal recessive complex neurodevelopmental disorder. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time.
