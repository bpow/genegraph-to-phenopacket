We studied 4 patients with AME, identifying 4 novel and 3 previously reported mutations in the HSD11B2 (HSD11K) gene. Point mutations causing amino acid substitutions were introduced into a pCMV5/11HSD2 expression construct and expressed in mammalian CHOP cells. Mutations L179R and R208H abolished activity in whole cells. Mutants S180F, A237V, and A328V had 19%, 72%, and 25%, respectively, of the activity of the wild-type enzyme in whole cells when cortisol was used as the substrate and 80%, 140%, and 55%, respectively, of wild-type activity when corticosterone was used as the substrate. However, these mutant proteins were only 0.6% to 5.7% as active as the wild-type enzyme in cell lysates, suggesting that these mutations alter stability of the enzyme. In regression analyses of all AME patients with published genotypes, several biochemical and clinical parameters were highly correlated with mutant enzymatic activity, demonstrated in whole cells, when cortisol was used as the substrate. These included the ratio of urinary cortisone to cortisol metabolites (R(2)=0.648, P<0.0001), age at presentation (R(2)=0.614, P<0.0001), and birth weight (R(2)=0.576, P=0.0004). Approximately 5% conversion of cortisol to cortisone is predicted in subjects with mutations that completely inactivate HSD11B2, suggesting that a low level of enzymatic activity is mediated by another enzyme, possibly 11-HSD1.","dc:creator":"Nunez BS","dc:date":"1999","dc:title":"Mutants of 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11-HSD2) with partial activity: improved correlations between genotype and biochemical phenotype in apparent mineralocorticoid excess."}},{"id":"cggv:3234e4d8-632f-436e-a957-d00374b93e70_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:cb279fab-03dd-455e-8138-7ca10146593d"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10523339"}],"rdfs:label":"Nunez 2"},{"id":"cggv:3234e4d8-632f-436e-a957-d00374b93e70","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3234e4d8-632f-436e-a957-d00374b93e70_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:3234e4d8-632f-436e-a957-d00374b93e70_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Abolished activity in whole cells."}],"strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:0e0b41ae-a422-4ac4-8e03-9c5f77b4a06d","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0e0b41ae-a422-4ac4-8e03-9c5f77b4a06d_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"This variant is described in the paper as F246+1nt → fs."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:f741f1b9-70d0-4d32-9487-312ab62113f9_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f741f1b9-70d0-4d32-9487-312ab62113f9","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":7,"allele":{"id":"cggv:02caa727-196c-4643-b32c-23e96d5b0e09","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000196.4(HSD11B2):c.1120C>T (p.Arg374Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA396284831"}},"firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypeFreeText":"Abnormal urinary steroid profile with increase in the excretion of urinary cortisol to cortisone metabolites, raised plasma cortisol half-life.","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0004322","obo:HP_0000822","obo:HP_0001508","obo:HP_0001959","obo:HP_0000103"],"sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:407889a0-6317-400a-8719-6819544698f0_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:02caa727-196c-4643-b32c-23e96d5b0e09"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8538347","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11 beta-HSD) catalyses the interconversion of hormonally active cortisol to inactive cortisone and is vital for dictating specificity for the mineralocorticoid receptor.

Mutations in HSD11B2 result in cortisol-induced activation of mineralocorticoid receptors and cause hypertension with hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, and suppressed circulating renin and aldosterone concentrations. This study uncovered the first patient with AME who was described in the literature, identified the genetic defect in HSD11B2, and provided evidence for a novel mechanism of reduced 11beta-HSD2 activity. This study identified a cluster of amino acids (335 to 339) in the C-terminus of 11beta-HSD2 that are essential for protein stability. The cluster includes Tyr(338), which is mutated in the index patient, and Arg(335) and Arg(337), previously reported to be mutated in hypertensive patients. It was found that wild-type 11beta-HSD2 is a relatively stable enzyme with a half-life of 21 h, whereas that of Tyr(338)His and Arg(337)His was 3 and 4 h, respectively. Enzymatic activity of Tyr(338)His was partially retained at 26 degrees C or in the presence of the chemical chaperones glycerol and dexamethasone, indicating thermodynamic instability and misfolding. The results provide evidence that the degradation of both misfolded mutant Tyr(338)His and wild-type 11beta-HSD2 occurs through the proteasome pathway. Therefore, impaired 11beta-HSD2 protein stability rather than reduced gene expression or loss of catalytic activity seems to be responsible for the development of hypertension in some individuals with AME.","dc:creator":"Atanasov AG","dc:date":"2007","dc:title":"Impaired protein stability of 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2: a novel mechanism of apparent mineralocorticoid excess."}},{"id":"cggv:094671c2-a25e-4537-af4e-1a370d21e3a9_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:569136e1-0031-40db-89f7-606b9bd243c8"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17314322"}],"rdfs:label":"Atanasov Proband"},{"id":"cggv:5ee32e99-9c1f-477b-b5c6-66caba25e5c8","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5ee32e99-9c1f-477b-b5c6-66caba25e5c8_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:5ee32e99-9c1f-477b-b5c6-66caba25e5c8_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Western blotting revealed that expression levels of Y338H were ~70% lower than that of WT HSD11B2.

The 11 beta HSD2 enzyme is responsible for the conversion of cortisol to the inactive metabolite cortisone and therefore protects the mineralocorticoid receptors from cortisol intoxication. Several homozygous mutations are associated with this potentially fatal disease. We have examined the phenotype, biochemical features, and genotype of 14 patients with AME. All of the patients had characteristic signs of a severe 11 beta HSD2 defect. Birth weights were significantly lower than those of their unaffected sibs. The patients were short, underweight, and hypertensive for age. Variable damage of one or more organs (kidneys, retina, heart, and central nervous system) was found in all of the patients except one. The follow-up studies of end-organ damage after 2-13 yr of treatment in six patients demonstrated significant improvement in all patients. The urinary metabolites of cortisol demonstrated an abnormal ratio with predominance of cortisol metabolites, i.e. tetrahydrocortisol plus 5 alpha-tetrahydrocortisol/tetrahydrocortisone was 6.7-33, whereas the normal ratio is 1.0. Infusion of [11-3H]cortisol resulted in little release of tritiated water, indicating the failure of the conversion of cortisol to cortisone. Thirteen mutations in the HSD11B2 gene have been previously published, and we report three new genetic mutations in two patients, one of whom was previously unreported. All of the patients had homozygous defects except one, who was a compound heterozygote. Our first case had one of the most severe mutations, resulting in the truncation of the enzyme 11 beta HSD2, and died at the age of 16 yr while receiving treatment. Three patients with identical homozygous mutations from different families had varying degrees of severity of clinical and biochemical features. Due to the small number of patients with identical mutations, it is difficult to correlate genotype with phenotype. In some cases, early and vigilant treatment of AME patients may prevent or improve the morbidity and mortality of end-organ damage such as renal or cardiovascular damage and retinopathy. The outcome of treatment in more patients may establish the efficacy of treatment.","dc:creator":"Dave-Sharma S","dc:date":"1998","dc:title":"Examination of genotype and phenotype relationships in 14 patients with apparent mineralocorticoid excess."}},"rdfs:label":"Patient J-3"},{"id":"cggv:f3955276-2727-436e-bd66-1b7ab3b17b8e","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f3955276-2727-436e-bd66-1b7ab3b17b8e_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Reduced by 0.5 points for both homozygosity and consanguinity."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:958373d5-466f-4c20-a7d0-77acc3a800a8_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:958373d5-466f-4c20-a7d0-77acc3a800a8","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtReport","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":2,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:5838f9d3-6ce7-4680-904d-8af3d5b14241","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000196.4(HSD11B2):c.914_924del (p.Gly305AlafsTer?)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA2695223627"}},{"id":"cggv:949bd55b-ebd8-4133-ac5d-844153d1978c","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000196.4(HSD11B2):c.695_703del (p.Tyr232_Thr234del)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA8110721"}}],"firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypes":"obo:HP_0032263","sex":"Male","variant":[{"id":"cggv:9c9beb16-f54b-45fb-b0e9-2873249f4429_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:949bd55b-ebd8-4133-ac5d-844153d1978c"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7670488"},{"id":"cggv:dc027f27-59ba-48d0-bb74-a352ebf5bf52_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:5838f9d3-6ce7-4680-904d-8af3d5b14241"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7670488"}],"rdfs:label":"Mune 8"},{"id":"cggv:9c9beb16-f54b-45fb-b0e9-2873249f4429","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:9c9beb16-f54b-45fb-b0e9-2873249f4429_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:9c9beb16-f54b-45fb-b0e9-2873249f4429_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"One variant occurs precisely in the catalytic site, eliminating a critical residue (Y232).

These additional mutations provide further insight into AME and the function of the 11beta-HSD2 enzyme. The prevalence of monogenic forms of hypertension such as AME remains uncertain.

To investigate the functional protection of the MR by 11beta-HSD2, we coexpressed epitope-tagged MR and 11beta-HSD2 in HEK-293 cells lacking 11beta-HSD2 activity and analyzed their subcellular localization by fluorescence microscopy. When expressed alone in the absence of hormones, the MR was both cytoplasmic and nuclear. However, when coexpressed with 11beta-HSD2, the MR displayed a reticular distribution pattern, suggesting association with 11beta-HSD2 at the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. The endoplasmic reticulum membrane localization of the MR was observed upon coexpression only with 11beta-HSD2, but not with 11beta-HSD1 or other steroid-metabolizing enzymes. Aldosterone induced rapid nuclear translocation of the MR, whereas moderate cortisol concentrations (10-200 nm) did not activate the receptor, due to 11beta-HSD2-dependent oxidation to cortisone. Compromised 11beta-HSD2 activity (due to genetic mutations, the presence of inhibitors, or saturating cortisol concentrations) led to cortisol-induced nuclear accumulation of the MR. Surprisingly, the 11beta-HSD2 product cortisone blocked the aldosterone-induced MR activation by a strictly 11beta-HSD2-dependent mechanism.

In addition, they detected an increase in renal membrane expressions of cleaved epithelial sodium channel-α and T53-phosphorylated Na+ -Cl − cotransporter in the knockout mice. Acute intraperitoneal administration of amiloride-induced natriuresis and increased urinary sodium/potassium ratio more in the knockout mice compared with those in the wild-type control mice. Chronic administration of amiloride and high-KCl diet significantly decreased mean blood pressure in the knockout mice, which was accompanied with the correction of hypokalemia and the resultant decrease in Na+ -Cl − cotransporter phosphorylation. Accordingly, a Na + -Cl − cotransporter blocker hydrochlorothiazide significantly decreased mean blood pressure in the knockout mice. Chronic administration of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist spironolactone significantly decreased mean blood pressure of the knockout mice along with downregulation of cleaved epithelial sodium channel-α and phosphorylated Na + -Cl − cotransporter expression in the knockout kidney. Our data suggest that kidney-specific deficiency of 11β-HSD2 leads to salt-dependent hypertension, which is attributed to mineralocorticoid receptor–epithelial sodium channel–Na + -Cl − cotransporter activation in the kidney, and provides evidence that renal dysfunction is essential for developing the phenotype of apparent mineralocorticoid excess.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28559392","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Genome-wide analysis of renal sodium-transporting system has identified specific variations of Mendelian hypertensive disorders, including ","dc:creator":"Ueda K","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Renal Dysfunction Induced by Kidney-Specific Gene Deletion of "},"rdfs:label":"Ueda Mouse Model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"This model was given 1 point total to remain conservative.

It is expressed in kidney, placenta, pancreas, prostate, ovary, small intestine and colon, and in lower levels in the spleen and testis (PMID:7859916).\n\n*HSD11B2* was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive apparent mineralocorticoid excess (AME) in 1995 (Mune et al., PMID: 7670488). AME is characterized by low-renin hypertension associated with low aldosterone, metabolic alkalosis, hypernatremia, and hypokalemia due to congenital defect in *HSD11B2* activity. This results in decreased conversion of biologically active cortisol to inactive cortisone allowing cortisol to act as a ligand for the mineralocorticoid receptor, resulting in sodium retention and volume expansion. The mechanism of pathogenicity is known to be loss of function.\n\nSixteen variants (missense, in-frame indel, nonsense, and frameshift) have been reported in twelve probands in six publications (PMIDs: 7670488, 8538347, 9661590, 10523339, 15134813, 17314322) included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached, considering case-level data.\n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by functional studies, expression studies, and animal models. Significant expression of *HSD11B2* in the kidney is demonstrated (PMID: 32913098). Additionally, *HSD11B2* is shown to interact with *NR3C2* (the mineralocorticoid receptor, definitively associated with autosomal dominant pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1). Finally, mouse models with null/knockout of *HSD11B2* are hypertensive with additional biochemical features consistent with AME (PMIDs: 18032795, 28559392). A total of 2/6 pts. for experimental evidence was reached.\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *HSD11B2* and autosomal recessive apparent mineralocorticoid excess. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time.\n\nThis classification was approved by the ClinGen Tubulopathy GCEP on the meeting date May 16, 2024 (SOP Version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:a8170a26-6ee5-4acc-bdb2-388097413f3a"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
