Nine HPS-causing genes have been identified in humans. HPS-1 is the most severe subtype with a prevalence of ~1/1800 in northwest Puerto Rico due to a founder mutation in the HPS1 gene. Mutations in HPS genes affect the biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles such as melanosomes in melanocytes and platelet dense granules. Two of these genes (HPS1 and HPS4) encode the HPS1 and HPS4 proteins, which assemble to form a complex known as Biogenesis of Lysosome-related Organelle Complex 3 (BLOC-3). We report the identification of the interacting regions in HPS1 and HPS4 required for the formation of this complex. Two regions in HPS1, spanning amino acids 1-249 and 506-700 are required for binding to HPS4; the middle portion of HPS1 (residues 250-505) is not required for this interaction. Further interaction studies showed that the N-termini of HPS1 and HPS4 interact with each other and that a discrete region of HPS4 (residues 340-528) interacts with both the N- and C-termini of the HPS1 protein. Several missense mutations found in HPS-1 patients did not affect interaction with HPS4, but some mutations involving regions interacting with HPS4 caused instability of HPS1. These observations extend our understanding of BLOC-3 assembly and represent an important first step in the identification of domains responsible for the biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles.","dc:creator":"Carmona-Rivera C","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"A divalent interaction between HPS1 and HPS4 is required for the formation of the biogenesis of lysosome-related organelle complex-3 (BLOC-3)."},"rdfs:label":"Carmona-Rivera_PI with HPS1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:a8e31a15-5d43-44c5-9d70-e0bfab9c4716","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:377f0f44-a920-41b5-a695-da323ea1b2c2","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionA"},"dc:description":"HPS1 is a subunit of the BLOC-3 complex, which it forms together with HPS4.

HPS is common in Puerto Rico, where it is caused by mutations in the genes HPS1 and, less often, HPS3 (ref. 8). In contrast, only half of non-Puerto Rican individuals with HPS have mutations in HPS1 (ref. 9), and very few in HPS3 (ref. 10). In the mouse, more than 15 loci manifest mutant phenotypes similar to human HPS, including pale ear (ep), the mouse homolog of HPS1 (refs 13,14). Mouse ep has a phenotype identical to another mutant, light ear (le), which suggests that the human homolog of le is a possible human HPS locus. We have identified and found mutations of the human le homolog, HPS4, in a number of non-Puerto Rican individuals with HPS, establishing HPS4 as an important HPS locus in humans. In addition to their identical phenotypes, le and ep mutant mice have identical abnormalities of melanosomes, and in transfected melanoma cells the HPS4 and HPS1 proteins partially co-localize in vesicles of the cell body. In addition, the HPS1 protein is absent in tissues of le mutant mice. These results suggest that the HPS4 and HPS1 proteins may function in the same pathway of organelle biogenesis.","dc:creator":"Suzuki T","dc:date":"2002","dc:title":"Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome is caused by mutations in HPS4, the human homolog of the mouse light-ear gene."},"rdfs:label":"Suzuki_Function similar to HPS1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":1},{"id":"cggv:3649fe18-730d-4d46-ad60-b70d421abc02_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:dd748aae-ff30-4654-a237-585c8ca6a819","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:618b0998-a61c-49e9-bce2-c16134f79150","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"The experiment was performed in the Auburn university channel catfish population.

Methods: We established the clinical and laboratory phenotype and genotype of six unrelated pedigrees comprising ten patients with clinical suspicion of HPS; including platelet aggregation, flow cytometry, platelet dense granule content, electron microscopy and high-throughput sequencing (HTS). Results: The clinical presentation showed significant heterogeneity and no clear phenotype-genotype correlations. HTS revealed two known and three novel disease-causing variants. The Spanish patients carried a homozygous p.Pro685Leufs17* deletion (n = 2) in HPS4, or the novel p.Arg822* homozygous variant (n = 1) in HPS3. In the case of two Turkish sisters, a novel missense homozygous HPS4 variant (p.Leu91Pro) was found. In two Portuguese families, genetic studies confirmed a previously reported nonsense variant (p.Gln103*) in DTNBP1 in three patients and a novel duplication (p.Leu22Argfs*33) in HPS6 in two unrelated patients. Conclusions: Our findings expand the mutational spectrum of HPS, which may help in investigating phenotype-genotype relationships and assist genetic counselling for affected individuals. This approach is a proof of principle that HTS can be considered and used in the first-line diagnosis of patients with biological and clinical manifestations suggestive of HPS.

Several genetic subtypes of HPS have been identified in human; however, the characterizations of HPS type 4 (HPS-4) genotype and phenotype remain unclear. This study was aimed to identify gene mutation responsible for HPS-4 with pulmonary fibrosis (PF).Two Chinese siblings in their 50 s afflicted with OCA and progressive dyspnea were recruited and underwent clinical and genetic examinations. In both patients, chest high-resolution computerized tomography showed severe interstitial PF in bilateral lung fields, and the pulmonary function test indicated restrictive lung disease. A novel homozygous frameshift mutation (NM_022081: c.630dupC; p.A211fs) in the HPS4 gene was identified by whole-exome sequencing analysis followed by Sanger DNA sequencing, and it segregated with the phenotypes. The c.630dupC mutation was not found in unaffected healthy controls. The patients were considered as HPS-4 with interstitial PF and eventually died of respiratory failure.This is the first report on the genotype and clinical phenotype of HPS-4 in China.

At least 20 unique variants, mostly nonsense and frameshift, but also a few missense variants have been reported in humans. HPS4 is involved in organelle biogenesis associated with melanosomes, platelet dense granules, and lysosomes. Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome 4 is characterized by oculocutaneous albinism and a bleeding diathesis, but in some cases, also pulmonary fibrosis and granulomatous colitis. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data.  \n  \nSummary of Case Level Data: 12 Points \nVariants in this gene have been reported in at least 9 probands in 7 publications (PMIDs: 24433314, 15108212, 30990103, 30791930, 29108692, 11836498, 31415434). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. \n  \nThe mechanism for disease is homozygous loss of function (PMID: 11836498).   \t \n  \nSummary of Experimental Data: 5 Points \nThis gene-disease association is supported by animal models and in vitro functional assays. The \"light ear\" or le mouse that carries a spontaneously occurring mutation in Hps4 recapitulates the human HPS phenotype (PMID: 11836498). Another spontaneously occurring HPS4 mutation is identified to be the cause of albinism in channel catfish (PMID: 28289846). HPS4 interacts with HPS1 to form BLOC-3, which is involved in the biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles (PMID: 11836498, 23103514).  \n\nIn summary, HPS4 is definitively associated with Autosomal Recessive Hermasky-Pudlak syndrome 4. \nThis has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hemostasis/Thrombosis GCEP on May 27, 2020 (SOP Version 7).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:3649fe18-730d-4d46-ad60-b70d421abc02"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
