Our in vivo experiments showed that while the K118N had a very mild effect on yeast behaviour, the phenotype caused by the E241K mutation was very severe and characterized by a highly compromised ability to grow on glycerol as a carbon source, an aberrant multi-vacuolar pattern and the deposition of thick F-actin bundles randomly in the cell. The latter feature is consistent with the highly unusual spontaneous tendency of the E241K mutant to form bundles in vitro, although this propensity to bundle was neutralized by tropomyosin and the E241K filament bundles were hypersensitive to severing in the presence of cofilin. In transiently transfected NIH3T3 cells both mutant actins were normally incorporated into cytoskeleton structures, although cytoplasmic aggregates were also observed indicating an element of abnormality caused by the mutations in vivo. Interestingly, gene-gun mediated expression of these mutants in cochlear hair cells results in no gross alteration in cytoskeletal structures or the morphology of stereocilia. Our results provide a more complete picture of the biological consequences of deafness-associated gamma-actin mutants and support the hypothesis that the post-lingual and progressive nature of the DFNA20/26 hearing loss is the result of a progressive deterioration of the hair cell cytoskeleton over time.","dc:creator":"Morín M","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"In vivo and in vitro effects of two novel gamma-actin (ACTG1) mutations that cause DFNA20/26 hearing impairment."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19477959","rdfs:label":"S840 Proband"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Mild impact on yeast.

The genetic contribution to age-related hearing loss is estimated to be 40%-50%. Gene mutations that cause nonsyndromic progressive hearing loss with early onset may provide insight into the etiology of presbycusis. We have identified four families segregating an autosomal dominant, progressive, sensorineural hearing loss phenotype that has been linked to chromosome 17q25.3. The critical interval containing the causative gene was narrowed to approximately 2 million bp between markers D17S914 and D17S668. Cochlear-expressed genes were sequenced in affected family members. Sequence analysis of the gamma-actin gene (ACTG1) revealed missense mutations in highly conserved actin domains in all four families. These mutations change amino acids that are conserved in all actins, from protozoa to mammals, and were not found in >100 chromosomes from normal hearing individuals. Much of the specialized ultrastructural organization of the cells in the cochlea is based on the actin cytoskeleton. Many of the mutations known to cause either syndromic or nonsyndromic deafness occur in genes that interact with actin (e.g., the myosins, espin, and harmonin). The mutations we have identified are in various binding domains of actin and are predicted to mildly interfere with bundling, gelation, polymerization, or myosin movement and may cause hearing loss by hindering the repair or stability of cochlear cell structures damaged by noise or aging.

Recently, mutations in ACTG1 were found to cause autosomal dominant, progressive, sensorineural hearing impairment linked to the DFNA20/26 locus on chromosome 17q25.3 in four American families and in one Dutch family. We report here the linkage of autosomal dominant, progressive, sensorineural hearing impairment in a large Norwegian family to the DFNA20/26 locus. Sequencing of ACTG1 identified a novel missense mutation (c.1109T>C; p.V370A) segregating with the hearing loss. Functional analysis in yeast showed that the p.V370A mutation restricts cell growth at elevated temperature or under hyperosmolar stress. Molecular modelling suggested that the p.V370A mutation modestly alters a site for protein-protein interaction in gamma-actin and thereby modestly alters gamma-actin-based cytoskeletal structures. Nineteen Norwegian and Danish families with autosomal, dominant hearing impairment were analyzed for mutations in ACTG1 by sequencing, but no disease-associated mutations were identified. Finally, a long-term follow-up of the hearing loss progression associated with the p.V370A mutation in ACTG1 is provided. The present study expands our understanding of the genotype-phenotype relationship of this deafness gene and provides a sensitive and simple functional assay for missense mutations in this gene, which may assist future molecular diagnosis of autosomal-dominant hearing impairment.

In this study, a Thr278Ile mutation was identified in helix 9 of the modelled protein structure. The alteration of residue Thr278 is predicted to have a small but significant effect on the gamma 1 actin structure owing to its close proximity to a methionine residue at position 313 in helix 11. Met313 has no space in the structure to move away. Moreover, the Thr278 residue is highly conserved throughout eukaryotic evolution.

The surprising viability and normal hearing of young Actg1(-/-) mice means that beta(cyto)-actin can likely build all essential non-muscle actin-based cytoskeletal structures including mechanosensory stereocilia of hair cells that are necessary for hearing. Although gamma(cyto)-actin-deficient stereocilia form normally, we found that they cannot maintain the integrity of the stereocilia actin core. In the wild-type, gamma(cyto)-actin localizes along the length of stereocilia but re-distributes to sites of F-actin core disruptions resulting from animal exposure to damaging noise. In Actg1(-/-) stereocilia similar disruptions are observed even without noise exposure.

Here, we compared the functions of β-actin and γ-actin in stereocilia formation and maintenance by generating mice conditionally knocked out for Actb or Actg1 in hair cells. We found that, although cytoplasmic actin is necessary, neither β-actin nor γ-actin is required for normal stereocilia development or auditory function in young animals. However, aging mice with β-actin- or γ-actin-deficient hair cells develop different patterns of progressive hearing loss and distinct pathogenic changes in stereocilia morphology, despite colocalization of the actin isoforms.

Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working group, while the molecular mechanism is not yet fully understood, individual variants appear to segregate with specific phenotypes and we have therefore split curations for the disease entities BWS and ADNSHL. ACTG1 was first reported in relation to autosomal dominant nonsyndromic hearing loss in 2003 (Zhu et al., PMID: 13680526). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data and experimental evidence. MIssense variants in this gene have been reported in at least 24 probands with ADNSHL in 15 publications (Zhu et al., 2003 PMID: 13680526; van Wijk et al., 2003 PMID: 14684684; Rendtorff et al., 2006 PMID: 16773128; Morin et al., 2009 PMID: 19477959; de Heer et al., 2009 PMID: 19548389; Liu et al., 2008 PMID: 18804074; Miyagawa et al., 2013 PMID: 24130743; Miyagawa et al., 2015 PMID: 25792668; Baek et all., 2013 PMID: 22938506; Park et al., 2013 PMID: 23506231; Vona et al., 2014 PMID: 24875298; Wei et al., 2014 PMID: 25388789; Cabanillas et al., 2018 PMID: 29986705; Lee et al., 2018 PMID: 29620237; Wang et al. 2018 PMID: 30599039). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in >100 additional family members. Although most de novo variants are seen in cases of BWS due to reduced reproductive fitness, de novo variants have been observed in individuals with ADNSHL (LMM unpublished data; Cabanillas et al. 2018 PMID: 29986705; Wang et al. 2018 PMID: 29357087). No loss-of-function variants have been reported in affected individuals, and one individual with a large deletion on chromosome 17 encompassing the ACTG1 gene did not have any of the major features of BWS including hearing loss (Riviere et al. 2012 PMID: 22366783). Additionally, no changes in protein levels of ACTG1 in patient cell lines containing pathogenic variants in ACTG1 were observed (Riviere et al. 2012 PMID: 22366783). These data suggest haploinsufficiency is not a mechanism of either ADNSHL or BWS and suggest both disorders may be due to gain-of-function through two distinct effects. Yeast models support functional effects of some of the reported hearing loss-causing variants (Bryan et al. 2006 PMID: 16690605, Bryan et al. 2009 PMID: 19419963; Morin et al., 2009 PMID: 19477959), and there is evidence that the amino acid position 118 is a mutational hot spot (Wang et al. 2018, PMID: 30599039). A homozygous ACTG1-null mouse model demonstrates progressive hearing loss which supports a role of the ACTG1 gene in hearing (Belyantseva et al. 2009, PMID: 19497859); however, this model constributed only limited experimental support given the mismatch in mutational mechanism to the human cases. Perrin et al., 2010 (PMID: 20976199) studied an ACTG1 conditional mouse model, however this model did not contribute additional data beyond the first mouse model given that the gene was knocked out as well. In summary, ACTG1 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant nonsyndromic hearing loss, based primarily on many human case observations with extensive segregation. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hearing Loss Working Group on 01/07/19.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:db9f5d19-5ebc-4a1a-a4c3-79ff27f69a0e"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
