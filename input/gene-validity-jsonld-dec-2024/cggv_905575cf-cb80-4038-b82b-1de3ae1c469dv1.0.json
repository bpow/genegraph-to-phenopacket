This disease is caused by a defect in reductive activation of methionine synthase (MTR). Our study was directed at clinical, biochemical, enzymatic and molecular characterization of two Czech patients with the cblE type of homocystinuria. Case 1 involves a 20-year-old mentally retarded patient who presented with megaloblastic anaemia at 10 weeks of age. She was treated with folates and vitamin B12, and subsequent attempts to cease administration of folates led to recurrence of megaloblastic anaemia. Biochemical features included severe hyperhomocysteinaemia and hypomethioninaemia and in fibroblasts defective formation of methionine from formate, and no complementation with cblE cells. Subsequent molecular analysis of the methionine synthase reductase (MTRR) gene revealed compound heterozygosity for a transition c.1459G>A (G487R) and a 2bp insertion (c.1623-1624insTA). Case 2 involves an 8-year-old girl with nystagmus and developmental delay in whom megaloblastic anaemia was detected at 11 weeks of age. Severe hyperhomocysteinaemia with normal methionine levels was found and enzymatic and complementation studies confirmed the cblE defect. This patient is homozygous for a 140 bp insertion (c.903-904ins140). The insertion is caused by a T>C transition within intron 6 of the MTRR gene, which presumably leads to activation of an exon splicing enhancer. In the families of both patients, enzymatic and mutation analyses were successfully used for prenatal diagnosis. Our study expands the knowledge of the phenotypic and genotypic variability of the cblE type of homocystinuria and supports the concept that this disorder is caused by mutations in the MTRR gene.","dc:creator":"Zavadakova P","dc:date":"2002","dc:title":"CblE type of homocystinuria due to methionine synthase reductase deficiency: clinical and molecular studies and prenatal diagnosis in two families."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12555939","rdfs:label":"Patient 1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"This individual, with cblE disorder, is compound heterozygous for a missense, p.Gly487Arg, and frameshift variant, c.1622_1623dup, in MTRR.

Deficiency in MSR activity occurs as the result of a defect in the MSR enzyme, which is required for the reductive activation of methionine synthase (MS). MS itself is responsible for the folate/cobalamin-dependent conversion of homo- cysteine to methionine. We have recently cloned the cDNA corresponding to the MSR protein, a novel member of the ferredoxin-NADP(+)reductase (FNR) family of electron transferases. We have used RT-PCR, heteroduplex, single-strand conformation poly- morphism (SSCP) and DNA sequence analyses to reveal 11 mutations in eight patients from seven families belonging to the cblE complementation group of patients of cobalamin metabolism that is defective in the MSR protein. The mutations include splicing defects leading to large insertions or deletions, as well as a number of smaller deletions and point mutations. Apart from an intronic substitution found in two unrelated patients, the mutations appear singular among individuals. Of the eleven, three are nonsense mutations, allowing for the identification of two patients for whom little if any MSR protein should be produced.

The findings were consistent with a deficiency of methionine synthase reductase. cblE confirmed by complementation analysis.","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:cb0c67fc-2f80-4aa9-bcd8-845337401c05_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":{"id":"cggv:5efc8f5e-5bc7-47df-89fa-6e5c6c1002c2","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"MTRR, 140-BP INS, NT903","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/7032"}},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"none","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12555939"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12555939","rdfs:label":"Patient 2"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"This patient, with cblE, is homozygous for a variant resulting in a splice enhance."},{"id":"cggv:3a453001-0f1b-4621-93c3-751957cd5470_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:96fb54fa-6a57-4494-8e37-33bc14452011","type":"Proband","detectionMethod":"Sequencing of the coding region of MTRR.","firstTestingMethod":"PCR","phenotypeFreeText":"cblE shown by complementation studies.","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001903","obo:HP_0001980","obo:HP_0000822","obo:HP_0005518","obo:HP_0002160","obo:HP_0003658","obo:HP_0000707"],"previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"At diagnosis: plasma total homocysteine 169 umol/L (normal 5-20), serum methionine 12 umol/L (normal 15-40) (Table 1).\n<1.5% normal activity of the methionine synthase/ methionine synthase reductase complex in fibroblasts, measured by formation of methionine from formate.\ncblE shown by complementation studies.\n","secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:3a453001-0f1b-4621-93c3-751957cd5470_variant_evidence_item","type":"MolecularSequenceObservation","allele":[{"id":"cggv:0b104e99-5cfe-46ae-a019-ab5d862e5340","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_002454.3(MTRR):c.1361C>T (p.Ser454Leu)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA254075"}},{"id":"cggv:f4db318d-4884-4ac8-86e3-28618d5046be","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_002454.3(MTRR):c.1573C>T (p.Arg525Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA10588405"}}],"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"none","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15714522"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15714522","rdfs:label":"Patient 6"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"This patient, with cblE disorder, is compound heterozygous for a nonsense, p.Arg525Ter, and a missense variant, p.Ser454Leu, in MTRR.

MTRR encodes methionine synthase reductase. This enzyme reactivates methionine synthase by reductive methylation of its cobalamin cofactor. Individuals with methylcobalamin deficiency type cblE usually present early childhood with failure to thrive, megaloblastic anemia, developmental delay, and cerebral atrophy with white matter abnormalities. Biochemical characteristics include homocystinuria, hyperhomocysteinemia, and often hypomethioninemia (Zavadakova et al, 2005, PMID 15714522). Variants in MTRR were first reported in patients with methylcobalamin deficiency type cblE in 1998 (LeClerc et al, PMID 9501215). Data from 9 probands, who are homozygous or compound heterozygous for MTRR variants were curated. This curation includes 11 unique variants (missense, frameshift, nonsense, intronic) from 3 publications (Wilson et al, 1999, PMID 10484769; Zavadakova et al, 2002, PMID 12555939, Zavadakova et al, 2005, PMID 15714522). More data is available in the literature but the maximum points for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. The gene-disease relationship is supported by the biochemical function of the product of MTRR, methionine synthase reductase, which is consistent with the biochemical features in patients with methylcobalamin deficiency type cblE (Olteanu et al, 2001, PMID 11466310; Yamada et al, 2006, PMID 16769880; Wolthers et al, 2009, PMID 19243433; Watkins and Rosenblatt, 2012, PMID 22108709); evidence supporting interaction with other proteins involved in cobalamin metabolism and associated with homocystinuria including MMACHC and methionine synthase (Wolthers et al, 2007, PMID; 17477549; Bassila et al, 2017, PMID 27771510); rescue of MSR function in cblE cells (Zavadáková et al, 2005, PMID 15714522; Palhais et al, 2015, PMID 25878036); and the findings reported in a hypomorphic mouse model (Elmore et al, 2007, PMID 17369066). More evidence is available in the literature but the maximum score for experimental evidence (6 points) has been reached.\nIn summary, MTRR is definitively associated with methylcobalamin deficiency type cblE. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This clinical validity classification was approved by the ClinGen Aminoacidopathy Gene Curation Expert Panel on July 2, 2021.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:905575cf-cb80-4038-b82b-1de3ae1c469d"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
