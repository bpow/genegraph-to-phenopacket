Few homozygous or compound heterozygous variants have been identified in the THOC6 gene in patients with a syndromic form of intellectual disability [Beaulieu-Boycott-Innes syndrome (BBIS); MIM: 613680]. Here we report two additional individuals affected with BBIS originating from the north of Europe and sharing a haplotype composed of three very rare missense changes in the THOC6 gene-Trp100Arg, Val234Leu, Gly275Asp. The first individual is a boy who is homozygous for the three-variant haplotype due to a maternal uniparental disomy event. The second is a girl who is compound heterozygous for this haplotype and a previously reported Gly190Glu missense variant. We analyzed the impact of these different amino acid changes on THOC6 protein expression, cellular localization and interaction with the other THO complex subunits. We show that the different THOC6 variants alter the physiological nuclear localizationof the protein and its interaction with at least two THO subunits, THOC1 and THOC5. Two amino acid changes from the three-variant haplotype alone have specific effects and might contribute to the pathogenicity of the haplotype. Overall, we expanded the cohort of currently known individuals with BBIS by reporting two individuals carrying the same recurrent European haplotype composed of three amino acid changes, affecting THOC6 localization and interaction with THO protein partners.","dc:creator":"Mattioli F","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"Clinical and functional characterization of recurrent missense variants implicated in THOC6-related intellectual disability."}},{"id":"cggv:603323b5-2de2-4af2-98e6-7d4dc9791b7b_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:dd6cc78f-ad26-494f-b815-692893fae5eb"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30476144"}],"rdfs:label":"p.Trp100Arg, p.Val234Leu, & p.Gly275Asp; & p.Gly190Glu "},{"id":"cggv:603323b5-2de2-4af2-98e6-7d4dc9791b7b","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:603323b5-2de2-4af2-98e6-7d4dc9791b7b_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:603323b5-2de2-4af2-98e6-7d4dc9791b7b_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"HeLa cell analysis indicates nuclear localization of THOC6 in the wild-type, but abnormal localization was seen in the p.Gly190Glu mutant.

The THO complex interacts with additional components to form the larger TREX complex (transcription export complex). Previously, a homozygous missense mutation in THOC6 in the Hutterite population was reported in association with syndromic intellectual disability. Using exome sequencing, we identified three unrelated patients with bi-allelic mutations in THOC6 associated with intellectual disability and additional clinical features. Two of the patients were compound heterozygous for a stop and a missense mutation, and the third was homozygous for a missense mutation; the missense mutations were predicted to be pathogenic by in silico analysis and modeling. Clinical features of the three newly identified patients and those previously reported are reviewed; intellectual disability is moderate to severe, and malformations are variable including renal and heart defects, cleft palate, microcephaly, and corpus callosum dysgenesis. Facial features are variable and include tall forehead, short upslanting palpebral fissures +/- deep set eyes, and a long nose with overhanging columella. These subtle facial features render the diagnosis difficult to make in isolation with certainty. Our results expand the mutational and clinical spectrum of this rare disease, confirm that THOC6 is an intellectual disability causing gene, while providing insight into the importance of the THO complex in neurodevelopment.","dc:creator":"Amos JS","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Autosomal recessive mutations in THOC6 cause intellectual disability: syndrome delineation requiring forward and reverse phenotyping."}},{"id":"cggv:2e6235a9-9418-4f86-b0dc-a4102095975a_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:a90a3edc-cd89-40eb-9e82-fc95dda5773f"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27102954"}],"rdfs:label":"p.Tyr45Ter & p.Gly190Glu "},{"id":"cggv:b641a73b-d64e-479a-a57c-0d6eacd5d816","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b641a73b-d64e-479a-a57c-0d6eacd5d816_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:b641a73b-d64e-479a-a57c-0d6eacd5d816_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"HeLa cell analysis indicates nuclear localization of THOC6 in the wild-type, but abnormal localization was seen in the p.Gly190Glu mutant.

In mammals, TREX is essential during embryogenesis, determining stem cell fate specification by regulating posttranscriptional self-renewal and differentiation in several tissues. It is composed of a core called THO, consisting of THOC1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and additional proteins. Bi-allelic mutations in THOC6 have been associated to Beaulieu-Boycott-Innes syndrome (BBIS), a syndromic form of intellectual disability (ID). To date, nine patients harbouring homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in THOC6 have been reported. Despite the clinical heterogenity and subtle dysmorphic features in some individuals, distinctive facial features are tall forehead, short and upslanting palpebral fissures, deep set eyes, flat philtrum, and malocclusion. Nonlife threatening congenital anomalies are common, including cardiac and renal malformations, anteriorly displaced anus, cryptorchidism in males, submucous cleft palate, and corpus callosum dysgenesis. Affected patients usually have short stature, mild microcephaly, and mild to moderate ID. Here, we describe an Italian patient with BBIS, carrying two compound heterozygous loss-of-function (LoF) variants in THOC6 (c.577C > T, p.R193* and c.792_793delCA, p.V264Vfs*48). In addition to the common phenotype, she displays cerebellar hypoplasia with severe vermian dysgenesis and hydrocephalus due to aqueductal stenosis, multiple skeletal anomalies and hypergonadotropic hypogonadism.

THOC6 is critical for mammalian Transcription Export complex (TREX) tetramer formation, which is composed of four six-subunit THO monomers. The TREX tetramer facilitates mammalian RNA processing, in addition to the nuclear mRNA export functions of the TREX dimer conserved through yeast. Human and mouse TIDS model systems revealed novel THOC6-dependent, species-specific TREX tetramer functions. Germline biallelic Thoc6 loss-of-function (LOF) variants result in mouse embryonic lethality. Biallelic THOC6 LOF variants reduce the binding affinity of ALYREF to THOC5 without affecting the protein expression of TREX members, implicating impaired TREX tetramer formation. Defects in RNA nuclear export functions were not detected in biallelic THOC6 LOF human neural cells. Instead, mis-splicing was detected in human and mouse neural tissue, revealing novel THOC6-mediated TREX coordination of mRNA processing. We demonstrate that THOC6 is required for key signaling pathways known to regulate the transition from proliferative to neurogenic divisions during human corticogenesis.

THOC6 was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive Beaulieu-Boycott-Innes Syndrome (BBIS) in 2013 (Beaulieu et al., PMID: 23621916), a neurodevelopmental condition with microcephaly and dysmorphic facial features. 10 variants (missense, nonsense, frameshift) that have been reported in at least 13 probands in 7 publications (PMIDs: 23621916, 26739162, 27102954, 30238602, 30476144, 31421288, 33739554) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss-of-function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence (functional alteration evidence, expression-level evidence, mouse model; PMIDs: 23621916, 38388531). Functional alteration evidence in HeLa cells showed an increase in apoptosis when knockdown of THOC6 occurred. Expression evidence showed THOC6 was expressed in zebrafish brains during development. A mouse model showed reduced size, delayed development, and early lethality in the mutant mice compared to the wild-type. In summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between THOC6 and autosomal recessive BBIS. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.
