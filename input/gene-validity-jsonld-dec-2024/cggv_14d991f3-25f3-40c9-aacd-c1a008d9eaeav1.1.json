However, understanding the impact of missense variants identified in this gene is a major challenge for the application of genomics into clinical practice. Herein, a comprehensive functional and structural analysis of 19 GLDC missense variants identified in a cohort of 26 NKH patients was performed. Mutant cDNA constructs were expressed in COS7 cells followed by enzymatic assays and Western blot analysis of the GCS P-protein to assess the residual activity and mutant protein stability. Structural analysis, based on molecular modeling of the 3D structure of GCS P-protein, was also performed. We identify hypomorphic variants that produce attenuated phenotypes with improved prognosis of the disease. Structural analysis allows us to interpret the effects of mutations on protein stability and catalytic activity, providing molecular evidence for clinical outcome and disease severity. Moreover, we identify an important number of mutants whose loss-of-functionality is associated with instability and, thus, are potential targets for rescue using folding therapeutic approaches.","dc:creator":"Bravo-Alonso I","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"Nonketotic hyperglycinemia: Functional assessment of missense variants in GLDC to understand phenotypes of the disease."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28244183","rdfs:label":"Pt 2"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"The patients is a compund heterozygote for a missense variant (pGly994Arg) and a frameshift variant (c.600delG).

A P-protein (glycine decarboxylase or GLDC) deficiency was reported in about 80% of NKH patients. We performed mutation analysis of the complete coding sequence of the GLDC gene in 28 unrelated patients with neonatal NKH using denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) and sequencing. Forty different gene alterations were identified, confirming the large molecular heterogeneity of the GLDC gene. Eighteen alterations were clearly disease-causing: two large deletions, four one-base deletions (c.28delC, c.1175delC, c.2186delC, c.2422delA), one 1-base insertion (c.1002_1003insT), one 4-base insertion (c.1285_1286insCAAA), one insertion/deletion (c.2153_2155delinsTCCTGGTTTA), five nonsense mutations (p.E153X, p.R236X, p.E270X, p.R337X, p.R424X) and four splice site mutations (c.861+1G > T, c.1402-1C > G, c.2316-1G > A, c.2919+1G > A). Additionally, we identified one intronic mutation outside the consensus splice sites (c.2838+5G > A) and 21 nucleotide substitutions leading to amino acid change (including three previously described mutations: p.T269M, p.R461Q, p.G771R), the pathogenicity of which should be confirmed by expression studies (p.S132W, p.Y138F, p.G171A, p.T187K, p.R212K, p.T269M, p.R373W, p.I440N, p.R461Q, p.N533Y, p.C644F, p.H651R, p.V705M, p.N732K, p.G771R, p.H775R, p.T830M, p.A841P, p.D880V, p.S957P and p.R966G). Mutation analysis allowed us to identify sequence alterations in both alleles for 19 patients and in one allele for 7 patients One patient was carrying three mutations (p.Y138F, p.T269M and p.E153X) and one patient was carrying two amino acid substitutions on the same allele (p.V705M and p.R212K) and an unidentified mutation on the other allele.

In animals and plants, the proteins form an enzyme complex loosely associating with the mitochondrial inner membrane. In the enzymatic reaction, H-protein converts P-protein, which is by itself a potential alpha-amino acid decarboxylase, to an active enzyme, and also forms a complex with T-protein. In both glycine cleavage and synthesis, aminomethyl moiety bound to lipoic acid of H-protein represents the intermediate that is degraded to or can be formed from N(5),N(10)-methylene-H(4)folate and ammonia by the action of T-protein. N(5),N(10)-Methylene-H(4)folate is used for the biosynthesis of various cellular substances such as purines, thymidylate and methionine that is the major methyl group donor through S-adenosyl-methionine. This accounts for the physiological importance of the glycine cleavage system as the most prominent pathway in serine and glycine catabolism in various vertebrates including humans. Nonketotic hyperglycinemia, a congenital metabolic disorder in human infants, results from defective glycine cleavage activity. The majority of patients with nonketotic hyperglycinemia had lesions in the P-protein gene, whereas some had mutant T-protein genes. The only patient classified into the degenerative type of nonketotic hyperglycinemia had an H-protein devoid of the prosthetic lipoyl residue. The crystallography of normal T-protein as well as biochemical characterization of recombinants of the normal and mutant T-proteins confirmed why the mutant T-proteins had lost enzyme activity. Putative mechanisms of cellular injuries including those in the central nervous system of patients with nonketotic hyperglycinemia are discussed.","dc:creator":"Kikuchi G","dc:date":"2008","dc:title":"Glycine cleavage system: reaction mechanism, physiological significance, and hyperglycinemia."},"rdfs:label":"Function of P protein (GLDC)"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"Glycine decarboxylase (P protein) has a well-known function in the glycine cleavage system, which is described in detail in this paper, and its function is consistent with the biochemical abnormalities observed in patients."},{"id":"cggv:7d9c9143-3539-4abf-9689-b29bf905eb3b","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a852f108-8989-4f9a-ba68-2bcfe264a57e","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionA"},"dc:description":"Glycine cleavage system (GCS) is a complex of four subunits: P-, T-, H- and L-proteins. \nGLDC encodes the P protein (pyridoxal-dependent glycine decarboxylase) which catalyses the first step of glycine cleavage, in which one carbon is released as CO2.

We show that reduced expression of Gldc in mice suppresses glycine cleavage system activity and causes two distinct disease phenotypes. Mutant embryos develop partially penetrant NTDs while surviving mice exhibit post-natal features of NKH including glycine accumulation, early lethality and hydrocephalus. In addition to elevated glycine, Gldc disruption also results in abnormal tissue folate profiles, with depletion of one-carbon-carrying folates, as well as growth retardation and reduced cellular proliferation. Formate treatment normalizes the folate profile, restores embryonic growth and prevents NTDs, suggesting that Gldc deficiency causes NTDs through limiting supply of one-carbon units from mitochondrial folate metabolism.

Variants in GLDC, which encodes the P-protein (glycine decarboxylase) of the glycine cleavage system, were first reported in humans with this disease as early as 1991 (Kure et al, PMID 1996985). At least 300 unique variants (52% missense mutations, 11% nonsense mutations, 10% splice-site mutations, 6% small insertions/deletions, and 21% exonic CNVs) have been reported in humans (Coughlin et al, 2017, PMID 27362913; van Hove et al, 2013, PMID 20301531).  Variants in this gene have been reported in about 80% of probands with glycine encephalopathy (nonketotic hyperglycinemia, NKH); most of the remaining patients have variants in AMT which encodes the T-protein of the glycine cleavage system. Ten patients and 12 unique variants in GLDC are included here (Kure et al, 1991, PMID 1996985; Conter et al, 2006, PMID 16601880; Ezgu et al, 2014, PMID 24407464; Swanson et al, 2015, PMID 26179960; Coughlin et al, 2017, PMID 27362913). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 points) has been reached. Of note, while most variants are private, a founder variant, p.Ser564Ile, accounts for about 70% of GLDC variants in the Finnish population (Kure et al, 1992, PMID 1634607), and other recurrent variants have been reported (Coughlin et al, 2017, PMID 27362913). The mechanism for disease is biallelic loss of function. This gene-disease relationship is supported by the biochemical function of the P protein (glycine carboxylase) in the glycine cleavage system, and a mouse model (Pai et al, 2015, PMID 25736695). In summary, GLDC is definitively associated with autosomal recessive glycine encephalopathy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:14d991f3-25f3-40c9-aacd-c1a008d9eaea"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
