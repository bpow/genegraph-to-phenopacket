Patients present in infancy with psychomotor retardation, chronic diarrhea, orthostatic acrocyanosis and relapsing petechiae. High levels of lactic acid, ethymalonic acid (EMA) and methylsuccinic acid (MSA) are detected in body fluids. Several pathways may contribute to the pathophysiology, including isoleucine, methionine and fatty acid metabolism. We report on a 15-month-old male presenting with typical EE associated with a homozygous ETHE1 mutation. We investigated oral isoleucine (150 mg/kg), methionine (100 mg/kg), fatty acid loading tests and isoleucine-restricted diet (200 mg/day) for any effects on several metabolic parameters. Before loading tests or specific dietary interventions, EMA, C4-C5 acylcarnitines and most acylglycines were elevated, indicating functional deficiency of short chain acyl-CoA (SCAD) as well as all branched acyl-CoA dehydrogenases. Excretion of EMA and n-butyrylglycine increased following each of the loads, and isoleucine led to increased levels of derivative metabolites. An isoleucine-restricted diet for 8 days corrected some of the abnormalities but led to no obvious clinical improvement and only partial effects on EMA. A principal component analysis supports the inference that these dietary conditions have consistent effects on the global metabolic profile. Our results suggest that multiple pathways modulate EMA levels in EE. They might all interact with H2S toxicity. Prolonged dietary interventions involving the restriction for branched aminoacids, fatty acids and methionine could be discussed as auxiliary therapeutical strategies in EE.","dc:creator":"Barth M","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"Multiple sources of metabolic disturbance in ETHE1-related ethylmalonic encephalopathy."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20978941","rdfs:label":"Patient 3 (Barth)"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandARDeNovoNullVariantCriteria","strengthScore":3,"dc:description":"This deletion is considered the ETHE1 common pathogenic mutation.

No treatment is currently available for this condition. Mice lacking Ndufs4, encoding NADH: ubiquinone oxidoreductase iron-sulfur protein 4 (NDUFS4) recapitulates the main findings of complex I (cI)-related LS, including severe multisystemic cI deficiency and progressive neurodegeneration. In order to develop a gene therapy approach for LS, we used here an AAV2/9 vector carrying the human NDUFS4 coding sequence (hNDUFS4). We administered AAV2/9-hNDUFS4 by intravenous (IV) and/or intracerebroventricular (ICV) routes to either newborn or young Ndufs4-/- mice. We found that IV administration alone was only able to correct the cI deficiency in peripheral organs, whereas ICV administration partially corrected the deficiency in the brain. However, both treatments failed to improve the clinical phenotype or to prolong the lifespan of Ndufs4-/- mice. In contrast, combined IV and ICV treatments resulted, along with increased cI activity, in the amelioration of the rotarod performance and in a significant prolongation of the lifespan. Our results indicate that extraneurological organs have an important role in LS pathogenesis and provide an insight into current limitations of adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated gene therapy in multisystem disorders. These findings warrant future investigations to develop new vectors able to efficiently target multiple organs.","dc:creator":"Di Meo I","dc:date":"2017","dc:title":"AAV9-based gene therapy partially ameliorates the clinical phenotype of a mouse model of Leigh syndrome."},"rdfs:label":"ETHE1 K/O mouse rescue"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanRescueCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Partial rescue of biochemical phenotype of ETHE1 knock out mouse."},{"id":"cggv:8d187f90-8018-4677-b589-aba361224b71","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:187b6190-d43a-44cf-a169-541aeba21c2a","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Model system demonstrated biochemical abnormalities consisted with Leigh syndrome (lactic acidemia and reduced COX activity) along with neurocognitive and developmental symptoms (Reduced motor activity and wide based gait).","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19136963","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Ethylmalonic encephalopathy is an autosomal recessive, invariably fatal disorder characterized by early-onset encephalopathy, microangiopathy, chronic diarrhea, defective cytochrome c oxidase (COX) in muscle and brain, high concentrations of C4 and C5 acylcarnitines in blood and high excretion of ethylmalonic acid in urine. ETHE1, a gene encoding a beta-lactamase-like, iron-coordinating metalloprotein, is mutated in ethylmalonic encephalopathy. In bacteria, ETHE1-like sequences are in the same operon of, or fused with, orthologs of TST, the gene encoding rhodanese, a sulfurtransferase. In eukaryotes, both ETHE1 and rhodanese are located within the mitochondrial matrix. We created a Ethe1(-/-) mouse that showed the cardinal features of ethylmalonic encephalopathy. We found that thiosulfate was excreted in massive amounts in urine of both Ethe1(-/-) mice and humans with ethylmalonic encephalopathy. High thiosulfate and sulfide concentrations were present in Ethe1(-/-) mouse tissues. Sulfide is a powerful inhibitor of COX and short-chain fatty acid oxidation, with vasoactive and vasotoxic effects that explain the microangiopathy in ethylmalonic encephalopathy patients. Sulfide is detoxified by a mitochondrial pathway that includes a sulfur dioxygenase. Sulfur dioxygenase activity was absent in Ethe1(-/-) mice, whereas it was markedly increased by ETHE1 overexpression in HeLa cells and Escherichia coli. Therefore, ETHE1 is a mitochondrial sulfur dioxygenase involved in catabolism of sulfide that accumulates to toxic levels in ethylmalonic encephalopathy.","dc:creator":"Tiranti V","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"Loss of ETHE1, a mitochondrial dioxygenase, causes fatal sulfide toxicity in ethylmalonic encephalopathy."},"rdfs:label":"ETHE1 Knockout Mouse Model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"Utilized model scoring system developed for Leigh syndrome experimental evidence"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":3}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":238,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria6","strengthScore":15,"subject":{"id":"cggv:be010aff-fedb-44d8-8491-904104a9049c","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0009723","gene":"hgnc:23287","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"The relationship between ETHE1 and Leigh syndrome spectrum was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of December 10, 2018. 34 articles were reviewed. ETHE1 was first reported in association with ethylmalonic encephalopathy in 2004 (Tiranti et al., PMID 14732903) and first associated Leigh syndrome spectrum in 2006 (Herberle et al., PMID 16376514). At least 39 unique variants predicted to cause a loss of or reduced function of the protein have been reported in ClinVar, suggesting homozygous loss of function is the mechanism of disease for this gene. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 7 probands with Leigh syndrome spectrum in 7 publications (PMID: 18593870, 20978941, 20528888, 27830356, 26917598, 16376514). This gene-disease association is supported by expression, animal model, and rescue experiments. As previously stated, this gene has been primarily associated with ethylmalonic encephalopathy (progressive disorder characterized by mutisystem involvement including chronic diarrhea, developmental delay, petechiae, and acrocyanosis). This phenotype will be assessed separately. In summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between ETHE1 and autosomal recessive Leigh syndrome spectrum. More than three years have elapsed from the first proposal of the association to reach a definitive classification. This classification was approved by the NICHD U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on December 10, 2018 (SOP Version 6).\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:d29d908d-ea85-4eb4-a6a5-400c95511c9a"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
