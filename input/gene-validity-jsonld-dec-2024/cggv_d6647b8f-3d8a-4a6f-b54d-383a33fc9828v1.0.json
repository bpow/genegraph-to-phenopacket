Five multi-subunit complexes in the inner membrane of the organelle are involved in the oxidative phosphorylation required for ATP production. Thirteen subunits of these complexes are encoded by the mitochondrial genome often referred to as mtDNA. For this reason, the expression of mtDNA is vital for the assembly and functioning of the oxidative phosphorylation complexes. Defects of the mechanisms regulating mtDNA gene expression have been associated with deficiencies in assembly of these complexes, resulting in mitochondrial diseases. Recently, numerous factors involved in these processes have been identified and characterized leading to a deeper understanding of the mechanisms that underlie mitochondrial diseases.","dc:creator":"D'Souza AR","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"Mitochondrial transcription and translation: overview."},"rdfs:label":"Overview of mitochondrial transcription and translation"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"13 OXPHOS polypeptides in mtDNA which is >10 genes and ELAC2 (16361254)"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:d6647b8f-3d8a-4a6f-b54d-383a33fc9828_functional_alteration_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:dd556f10-d74b-4cd0-870e-161d9f4a7dbf","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:69d46314-5936-4bb9-bed8-5d199e78c03b","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Significant reductions in tRNA Ser(UCN) levels were seen compared to control (ranging from 33-37% of control\n\nPerformed in two affected individuals with similar results (Lymphoblastoid cell line)\nLevels of MT-TK, MT-TL1, MT-TG, MT-TE and MT-TQ normal\n\nAlso saw the 5587T>C variant in MT-TA but tRNA ala levels were normal (in silico agree benign and this variant is seen in 35 sequences in mitomap (0.06%))","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20153673","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) have been found to be one of the most important causes of sensorineural hearing loss. We report here a clinical, genetic, molecular and biochemical characterization of a Han Chinese pedigree with maternally transmitted nonsyndromic hearing impairment. Seven of nine matrilineal relatives exhibited a variable severity and age-at-onset (8 years old) of hearing loss. Mutational analysis of mtDNA identified the novel homoplasmic tRNA(Ser(UCN)) 7505T>C mutation and other 37 variants belonging to haplogroup F1. The 7505T>C mutation, which is absent in 449 Chinese controls, is located at a highly conserved base-pairing (10A-20U) of tRNA(Ser(UCN)). The abolishment of 10A-20U base-pairing likely alters the tRNA(Ser(UCN)) metabolism. Functional significant of this mutation was supported by approximately 65% reductions in the level of tRNA(Ser(UCN)) observed in the lymphoblastoid cell lines carrying the 7505T>C mutation, compared with the wild-type cell lines. This reduced tRNA level is below the proposed threshold to support a normal respiration in lymphoblastoid cells. Furthermore, the highly conserved tRNA(Ala) 5587T>C and Cytb C93Y variants may have a modifying role of deafness expression associated with the 7505T>C mutation. However, genotyping analysis of nuclear modifier gene TRMU and the prominent deafness-cause gene GJB2 failed to detect any mutations in the member of this family. These data strongly indicate that the novel tRNA(Ser(UCN)) 7505T>C mutation is involved in maternally transmitted hearing loss. However, other genetic, epigenetic or environmental factors may contribute to the phenotypic variability of this family. Our findings will be helpful for counseling families of maternally inherited hearing loss.","dc:creator":"Tang X","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"Maternally inherited hearing loss is associated with the novel mitochondrial tRNA Ser(UCN) 7505T>C mutation in a Han Chinese family."},"rdfs:label":"Northern blot of mt-tRNAs in patient tissue"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"Score of 0.5 for abnormal Northern in patient with hearing loss with MT-TS1 variant "},{"id":"cggv:6290e813-929b-41dc-a075-677af979947c","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:6429c497-dbc5-4692-ac7e-9da78cfdd503","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Mitochondrial Cybrids created from patient E in Jaksch (homoplasmic 6 year old boy)\nn=22 clones for m.7512T>C\n\ncreated from osteosarcoma cell cybrids (143B is used at control)\n\nRestriction fragment length analysis showed that all clones, but also the patients fibroblasts were homoplasmic\n\nThe complete absence of patient-derived nuclear DNA was confirmed in all clones used for further studies. \n\nIn all 143B control cells, 143B rho0 acceptor cells and all tested clones amplification yielded only\none fragment of a given size while amplification in the two patient fibroblast cell lines yielded one or two fragments, in both cases of a different size.

By comparing in vitro transcribed molecules with native RNA in such gels, we also identified tRNA(Ser(UCN)) being present in two isoforms in vivo, probably corresponding to the nascent, unmodified transcripts co-migrating with the in vitro transcripts and a second, faster moving isoform corresponding to the mature tRNA. In cybrids containing either mutations the unmodified isoforms were severely reduced. We hypothesize that both mutations lead to an impairment of post-transcriptional modification processes, ultimately leading to a preponderance of degradation by nucleases over maturation by modifying enzymes, resulting in severely reduced tRNA(Ser(UCN)) steady state levels. We infer that an increased degradation rate, caused by disturbance of tRNA maturation and, in the case of the G7497A mutant, alteration of tRNA structure, is a new pathogenic mechanism of mt tRNA point mutations.","dc:creator":"Möllers M","dc:date":"2005","dc:title":"A new mechanism for mtDNA pathogenesis: impairment of post-transcriptional maturation leads to severe depletion of mitochondrial tRNASer(UCN) caused by T7512C and G7497A point mutations."},"rdfs:label":"Cybrid notes "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityPatientCellFunctionalAlterationCriteria","strengthScore":0,"dc:description":"Will be scored as a definite recurrent pathogenic variant due to compelling cybrid data in cases "},{"id":"cggv:e99a66c3-25fe-462d-9e48-b925a8647056","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ae869f70-fc9b-4e38-b931-9f586a30ed7d","type":"FunctionalAlteration","dc:description":"Note testing below is on autopsy derived tissues:\n\nur patient had a combined CI/CIV deficiency with 5–10% of residual activities, and a 50% reduction in CIII activity in the skeletal muscle ( Table 1 ). \nBlue-native electrophoresis ( Figure 1f ) indicated total loss of CI and CIV in the liver and skeletal muscle and a severe loss of both complexes in the heart as well, indicating a total inability of tRNASer (UCN) to participate in mitochondrial translation. \nThe brain showed a severely decreased amount of CIV protein, but a close to normal amount of CI.\n\n Northern blot analysis of autopsy sample–derived total RNA of the patient showed an almost total loss of full-length tRNASer (UCN) in the heart and severe reduction in the liver and skeletal muscle ( Figure 1d ), together with multiple tRNASer (UCN) signals, which were not seen in the two controls.

Defects of this tRNA lead to impaired mitochondrial translation, which leads to decreased synthesis of mtDNA-encoded subunits of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes I, III, IV, and V, resulting in impaired OXPHOS enzyme activities. \n \n*MT-TS1* was first reported in relation to maternally-inherited primary mitochondrial disease in 1995 (PMID: 7669057), in a 26-year-old woman with a history of seizures, intellectual disability, basal ganglia calcification, hearing loss and increased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum lactate.  While various names could be given to the constellation of features seen in those with *MT-TS1*-related disorders, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *MT-TS1* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework.\n\nEvidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included five unique variants including one insertion (m.7451A>T, m.7453G>A, m.7471dupC - also referred to as m7472insC, m.7497G>A, m.7512T>C; of note m.7497G>A, m.7453G>A, m.7471dupC, and m.7512T>C have been reported in multiple probands) observed in eight probands across six publications (PMIDs: 7669057, 9778262, 14605505, 23696415, 33279600, 7581383). Clinical features seen in affected individuals range from isolated hearing loss to mitochondrial myopathy to mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) and myoclonus epilepsy, ragged red fibers (MERRF). One case of fatal neonatal lactic acidosis has been reported. Intrafamilial variability has been observed. Muscle biopsy often shows COX-negative fibers and/or ragged red fibers. A combined mitochondrial chain respiratory deficiency (commonly involving complexes I and IV) may also be observed in muscle biopsies. Heteroplasmy levels in affected individuals are often near homoplasmy in muscle and lower in tissues such as blood and urine, although homoplasmy across multiple tissues has also been seen. One individual had mitochondrial myopathy with heteroplasmy levels as low as 37% heteroplasmy in muscle Multiple single fiber studies and cybrid analyses were performed in these patients and supportive of variant pathogenicity (PMIDs: 16199753, 23696415, 33279600, 11919191). The mechanism of disease appears to be loss of function.  This gene-disease association is further supported by a known biochemical function shared with other genes associated with primary mitochondrial disease and functional alteration in patient cells (PMIDs: 30030363, 17894844, 22453297, 20153673). \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support this gene-disease relationship, including that more than three years have elapsed since the first proposal of the association. No convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on January 19, 2023 (SOP Version 9).
