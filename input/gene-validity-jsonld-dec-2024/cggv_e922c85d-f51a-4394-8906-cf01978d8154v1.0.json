In ∼90% of CVID-affected individuals, no genetic cause of the disease has been identified. In a Dutch-Australian CVID-affected family, we identified a NFKB1 heterozygous splice-donor-site mutation (c.730+4A>G), causing in-frame skipping of exon 8. NFKB1 encodes the transcription-factor precursor p105, which is processed to p50 (canonical NF-κB pathway). The altered protein bearing an internal deletion (p.Asp191_Lys244delinsGlu; p105ΔEx8) is degraded, but is not processed to p50ΔEx8. Altered NF-κB1 proteins were also undetectable in a German CVID-affected family with a heterozygous in-frame exon 9 skipping mutation (c.835+2T>G) and in a CVID-affected family from New Zealand with a heterozygous frameshift mutation (c.465dupA) in exon 7. Given that residual p105 and p50—translated from the non-mutated alleles—were normal, and altered p50 proteins were absent, we conclude that the CVID phenotype in these families is caused by NF-κB1 p50 haploinsufficiency.","dc:creator":"Fliegauf M","dc:date":"2015","dc:title":"Haploinsufficiency of the NF-κB1 Subunit p50 in Common Variable Immunodeficiency."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26279205","rdfs:label":"FamNL1-36"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNullCriteria","strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"Variant is absent from gnomAD v2 and 5/5 splicing algorithms in Alamut predict the lost of a donor canonical splice site.

Common variable immunodeficiency associated with pathogenic NFKB1 variants has a heterogeneous presentation in patients, often including hypogammaglobulinemia with or without changes to the size of the overall B cell population and increased susceptibility to autoimmunity, infections, and malignancies (PMID: 29477724). Ten variants (e.g. missense, nonsense, frameshift, and splice site) that have been reported in ten probands in two publications (PMIDs: 29477724, 26279205) are included in this curation. In addition, segregation of an NFKB1 variant in a family with common variable immunodeficiency was included as evidence (PMID: 26279205). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is reported to be loss of function. This gene-disease association is also supported by animal models and in vitro functional assays (PMIDs: 7834752, 25225457, 27022143, 28115215). Specifically, mouse models with abrogated NFKB1 expression presented with features of human disease, including increased susceptibility to certain infections, decreased levels of certain antibody subtypes, and increased incidence of autoimmunity (PMIDs: 7834752, 27022143). Defects in T-cell-dependent antigen-specific antibody production by B cells with decreased p50 expression in mice were found to be overcome by genetically increased expression of p50 (PMID: 25225457). In addition, human cell lines expressing missense NFKB1 variants were found to have functional defects, including reduced nuclear translocation of NFKB1 and stability (PMID: 28115215).  Notably, NFKB1-associated common variable immunodeficiency has a reduced penetrance that is estimated to be 60-80% based on family studies and intra- and inter-familial differences in expressivity, age of onset, and clinical features have been reported. (PMIDs: 28115215, 29477724). While NFKB1 is clearly associated with common variable immunodeficiency, patients with alternative phenotypes have been reported, including one family with postoperative necrotizing cellulitis and neutrophilia in the absence of hypogammaglobulinemia and increased susceptibility to infections and another family with Behcet’s disease along with hypogammaglobulinemia and recurrent infections (PMID: 28115215). Therefore, the clinical signs and symptoms associated with NFKB1 may still be emerging and NFKB1 defects should be considered in patients with immunodeficiency and associated evidence of autoinflammation. In summary, NFKB1 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant common variable immunodeficiency. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:e922c85d-f51a-4394-8906-cf01978d8154"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
