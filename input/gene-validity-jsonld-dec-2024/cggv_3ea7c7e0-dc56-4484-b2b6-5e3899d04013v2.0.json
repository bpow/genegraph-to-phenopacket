Subsequently, we ascertained five additional consanguineous families in which deafness segregated with markers at this locus and refined the critical interval to 2.31 Mb. We then sequenced the protein-coding exons of 18 genes in this interval. The affected individuals of six apparently unrelated families were homozygous for the same transversion (c.265T>G) in MSRB3, which encodes a zinc-containing methionine sulfoxide reductase B3. c.265T>G results in a substitution of glycine for cysteine (p.Cys89Gly), and this substitution cosegregates with deafness in the six DFNB74 families. This cysteine residue of MSRB3 is conserved in orthologs from yeast to humans and is involved in binding structural zinc. In vitro, p.Cys89Gly abolished zinc binding and MSRB3 enzymatic activity, indicating that p.Cys89Gly is a loss-of-function allele. The affected individuals in two other families were homozygous for a transition mutation (c.55T>C), which results in a nonsense mutation (p.Arg19X) in alternatively spliced exon 3, encoding a mitochondrial localization signal. This finding suggests that DFNB74 deafness is due to a mitochondrial dysfunction. In a cohort of 1,040 individuals (aged 53-67 years) of European ancestry, we found no association between 17 tagSNPs for MSRB3 and age-related hearing loss. Mouse Msrb3 is expressed widely. In the inner ear, it is found in the sensory epithelium of the organ of Corti and vestibular end organs as well as in cells of the spiral ganglion. Taken together, MSRB3-catalyzed reduction of methionine sulfoxides to methionine is essential for hearing.","dc:creator":"Ahmed ZM","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"Functional null mutations of MSRB3 encoding methionine sulfoxide reductase are associated with human deafness DFNB74."}},"rdfs:label":"proband-PKDF805"},{"id":"cggv:3575b950-7e32-4800-812d-120b4a73a321","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3575b950-7e32-4800-812d-120b4a73a321_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:3575b950-7e32-4800-812d-120b4a73a321_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Variant expressed in E.coli and eliminates all enzymatic activity and zinc binding compared to WT MSRB3"}],"strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:3ea7c7e0-dc56-4484-b2b6-5e3899d04013_seg_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValiditySegregationEvidencCriteria","strengthScore":3},{"id":"cggv:286c8e5b-a42d-4e43-b92a-555c96a34cbb_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Inconclusive","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:00096524-1942-474d-8d41-68338ce22584_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:00096524-1942-474d-8d41-68338ce22584","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:2bf7ce40-1d96-4263-a7e7-707731991b31","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001031679.3(MSRB3):c.391-1G>A","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/562077"}},"detectionMethod":"This study consists of cohorts 1-3, with Sanger, WES, gene panel Sanger/genotyping.

In this study, we utilized genome-wide genotyping, Sanger and exome sequencing to identify 163 DNA variants in 41 previously reported HL genes segregating in 321 Pakistani families. Of these, 70 (42.9%) variants identified in 29 genes are novel. As expected from genetic studies of disorders segregating in consanguineous families, the majority of affected individuals (94.4%) are homozygous for HL-associated variants, with the other variants being compound heterozygotes. The five most common HL genes in the Pakistani population are SLC26A4, MYO7A, GJB2, CIB2 and HGF, respectively. Our study provides a profile of the genetic etiology of HL in Pakistani families, which will allow for the development of more efficient genetic diagnostic tools, aid in accurate genetic counseling, and guide application of future gene-based therapies. These findings are also valuable in interpreting pathogenicity of variants that are potentially associated with HL in individuals of all ancestries. The Pakistani population, and its infrastructure for studying human genetics, will continue to be valuable to gene discovery for HL and other inherited disorders.","dc:creator":"Richard EM","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"Global genetic insight contributed by consanguineous Pakistani families segregating hearing loss."}},"rdfs:label":"PKDF 1789 Proband"},{"id":"cggv:cfd0711f-5b6c-4e6b-b152-12717ddf2a05","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:cfd0711f-5b6c-4e6b-b152-12717ddf2a05_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"This variant is in last exon of MSRB3, which is more than 10% of the gene, but scored conservatively."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:514ec97c-7170-4b93-ab0d-67725af3c5f4_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:514ec97c-7170-4b93-ab0d-67725af3c5f4","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:b53e4663-889f-4ba9-9eb8-2f2f3a7696eb","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_001031679.3(MSRB3):c.55C>T (p.Arg19Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/31056"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:d31fe200-feaa-4fa1-98e6-d00fdc91d47d_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:b53e4663-889f-4ba9-9eb8-2f2f3a7696eb"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21185009"},"rdfs:label":"proband-4258"},{"id":"cggv:d31fe200-feaa-4fa1-98e6-d00fdc91d47d","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d31fe200-feaa-4fa1-98e6-d00fdc91d47d_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:d31fe200-feaa-4fa1-98e6-d00fdc91d47d_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"This variant alters mitochondrial isoforms of MSRB3."}],"strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:408e7c4a-32d9-4641-a05f-49264842c6a8_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:408e7c4a-32d9-4641-a05f-49264842c6a8","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:3324dfe6-b92b-41de-86f6-b954dedc99fa"},"detectionMethod":"This study consists of cohorts 1-3, with Sanger, WES, gene panel Sanger/genotyping.

A recent genetic study showed that the MSRB3 gene is associated with autosomal recessive hearing loss in human deafness DFNB74. However, the precise role of MSRB3 in the auditory system and the pathogenesis of hearing loss have not yet been determined. This work is the first to generate MsrB3 knockout mice to elucidate the possible pathological mechanisms of hearing loss observed in DFNB74 patients. We found that homozygous MsrB3(-/-) mice were profoundly deaf and had largely unaffected vestibular function, whereas heterozygous MsrB3(+/-) mice exhibited normal hearing similar to that of wild-type mice. The MsrB3 protein is expressed in the sensory epithelia of the cochlear and vestibular tissues, beginning at E15.5 and E13.5, respectively. Interestingly, MsrB3 is densely localized at the base of stereocilia on the apical surface of auditory hair cells. MsrB3 deficiency led to progressive degeneration of stereociliary bundles starting at P8, followed by a loss of hair cells, resulting in profound deafness in MsrB3(-/-) mice. The hair cell loss appeared to be mediated by apoptotic cell death, which was measured using TUNEL and caspase 3 immunocytochemistry. Taken together, our data suggest that MsrB3 plays an essential role in maintaining the integrity of hair cells, possibly explaining the pathogenesis of DFNB74 deafness in humans caused by MSRB3 deficiency.","dc:creator":"Kwon TJ","dc:date":"2014","dc:title":"Methionine sulfoxide reductase B3 deficiency causes hearing loss due to stereocilia degeneration and apoptotic cell death in cochlear hair cells."},"rdfs:label":"mouse expression/localization"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:fe3580ec-fecd-431a-895e-a6413441d834","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0589383c-c935-4f25-8b73-013cb27ac75c","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"},"dc:description":"Death of hair cells causes SNHL.

MSRB3 was first associated with this disease in humans as early as 2011 (Ahmed et al.​ 2011; PMID: 21185009). Association is seen in at least 8 probands in 2 publications and unpublished clinical data (PMIDs: 21185009, 30303587, Mass General Brigham LMM unpublished internal data, SCV000271241.2).

Variants in this gene segregated with disease in at least 6 families. This gene-disease association is supported by a null mouse model, rescue in mice ears, biochemical function, and two expression studies. In summary, there is definitive  evidence to support this gene-disease association. This gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the Hearing Loss Gene Curation Expert Panel on 11/15/2017.  It was reevaluated on 9/21/2021 (SOP v8).  As a result of this reevaluation, the classification changed from Moderate to Definitive, based on new literature and new SOP scoring.
