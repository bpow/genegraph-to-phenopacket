Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working group, while the molecular mechanism is not yet fully understood, individual variants appear to segregate with specific phenotypes and we have therefore split curations for the disease entities BWS and ADNSHL. The primary features of BWS include intellectual disability, trigonocephaly, hypertelorism, ptosis, and arched eyebrows, and secondary features include pachygyria/lissencephaly, coloboma, hearing loss, epilepsy, microphthalmia, agenesis or thickened corpus callosum (Yates et al. 2017 PMID: 27625340). The ACTG1 and autosomal dominant BWS relationship is supported by at least 11 de novo missense variants reported in at least 12 probands in 5 publications (Riviere et al. 2012 PMID: 22366783; Verloes et al. 2014 PMID: 25052316 ; Rainger et al. 2017 PMID: 28493397; Poirier et al. 2015 PMID: 26188271; Donato et al. 2016 PMID: 27240540). Additional cases have been reported, however parents were either not tested or not available for testing. 62% (8/13) of reported probands with a BWS diagnosis for whom clinical information was available had some degree of hearing loss, though severity, progressivity, and age-of-onset of hearing loss were variable. Variable expressivity has been reported in one family with hearing loss, seizures, estropia, and ocular coloboma (Kemerley et al. 2017 PMID: 27096712), as has isolated coloboma (Rainger et al. 2017 PMID: 28493397). In general, the association of de novo occurence with BWS is likely due to reduced reproductive fitness, however de novo variants have also been observed in individuals with ADNSHL (LMM unpublished data; Cabanillas et al. 2018 PMID: 29986705; Wang et al. 2018 PMID: 29357087). The existence of variant-specific phenotypes are supported by functional evidence in cell lines derived from BWS patients (Riviere et al. 2012 PMID: 22366783) and in yeast containing hearing loss-causing variants (Bryan et al. 2006 PMID: 16690605). No loss-of-function variants have been reported in affected individuals, and one individual with a large deletion on chromosome 17 encompassing the ACTG1 gene did not have any of the major features of BWS (Riviere et al. 2012 PMID: 22366783). Additionally, no changes in protein levels of ACTG1 in patient cell lines containing pathogenic variants in ACTG1 were observed (Riviere et al. 2012 PMID: 22366783). These data suggest haploinsufficiency is not a mechanism of either ADNSHL or BWS and suggest both disorders may be due to gain-of-function through two distinct effects. In summary, ACTG1 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant Baraitser-Winter syndrome, primarily based upon many cases with de novo variation. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Hearing Loss Working Group on 01/07/19.\n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:9969a221-1ce9-44c6-8ab7-2ad5f7ccd5ab"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
