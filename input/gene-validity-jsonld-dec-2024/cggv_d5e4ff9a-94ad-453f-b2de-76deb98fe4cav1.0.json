These lesions being nonspecific and the clinical phenotype being heterogeneous, multi-minicore disease boundaries remain unclear. To identify its genetic basis, we performed a genome-wide screening in a consanguineous Algerian family in which three children presented in infancy with moderate weakness predominant in axial muscles, pelvic girdle and hands, joint hyperlaxity (hand involvement phenotype), and multiple minicores. We mapped the disease to chromosome 19q13 in this family and, subsequently, in three additional families showing a similar phenotype, with a maximum LOD score of 5.19 for D19S570. This locus was excluded in 16 other multi-minicore disease families with predominantly axial weakness, scoliosis, and respiratory insufficiency (\"classical\" phenotype). In the Algerian family, we identified a novel homozygous missense mutation (P3527S) in the ryanodine receptor type 1 gene, a positional candidate gene responsible for the autosomal dominant congenital myopathy central core disease. New muscle biopsies from the three patients at adulthood demonstrated typical central core disease with rods; no cores were found in the healthy parents.

Inactivation of the RYR1 gene in mice is lethal at birth. In humans only missense and in-frame mutations in the RYR1 gene have been associated so far with various muscle disorders including malignant hyperthermia, central core disease and the moderate form of multi-minicore disease (MmD). We identified a cryptic splicing mutation in the RYR1 gene that resulted in a 90% decrease of the normal RYR1 transcript in skeletal muscle. The 14646+2.99 kb A-->G mutation was associated with the classical form of MmD with ophthalmoplegia, whose genetic basis was previously unknown. The mutation present at a homozygous level was responsible for a massive depletion of the RYR1 protein in skeletal muscle. The mutation was not expressed in lymphoblastoid cells, pointing toward a tissue specific splicing mechanism.

Quantitative defects of RYR1 have been reported in families presenting with recessive forms of the disease and epigenic regulation has been recently proposed to explain potential maternal monoallelic silencing of the RYR1 gene. We investigated nine families presenting with a recessive form of the disease and showing a quantitative defect of RYR1 expression. Genetic analysis allowed the identification of a mutation on both alleles of the RYR1 gene for all patients, 15 being novel variants. We evidenced for all patients an alteration of the expression of the RYR1 gene caused by amorphic mutations responsible either for mRNA or protein instability. In seven families the variant present on the second allele was a missense mutation. In the remaining two families the second variant led to a hypomorphic expression of the RYR1 gene and was associated with a severe neonatal phenotype, pointing out the minimal amount of RYR1 needed for skeletal muscle function. Noticeably, a novel additional exon 3b was characterized in the most severely affected cases. This study showed that all cases presenting with a quantitative defect of RYR1 expression in our panel of patients affected by recessive core myopathies were caused by the presence of one recessive null allele and that variability of the phenotype depended on the nature of the mutation present on the second allele. Our study also indicated that presence of a second mutation must be investigated in sporadic cases or in dominant cases presenting with a familial clinical variability.","dc:creator":"Monnier

The interaction between RyR1 and DHPR proteins underlies depolarization-induced Ca(2+) release during EC coupling in skeletal muscle. We report a 35-year-old woman presenting with signs and symptoms of a congenital myopathy at birth and repeated episodes of generalized, atypical normokalaemic paralysis in her late teens. Genetic studies of this patient revealed three heterozygous RYR1 substitutions (p.Arg2241X, p.Asp708Asn and p.Arg2939Lys) associated with marked reduction of the RyR1 protein and abnormal DHPR distribution. We conclude that RYR1 mutations may give rise to both myopathies and atypical periodic paralysis, and RYR1 mutations may underlie other unresolved cases of periodic paralysis with unusual features.","dc:creator":"Zhou H","dc:date":"2010","dc:title":"Multi-minicore disease and atypical periodic paralysis associated with novel mutations in the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor (RYR1) gene."},"rdfs:label":"Immunofluorescence labeling"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:514eb27e-dbcb-4af6-8997-1ffffb8d4af2","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f3e4019b-cbb3-4e25-86fc-afc4cfbcbbc5","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:GeneExpressionA"},"dc:description":"RYR1 expression shown in skeletal muscle tissue with immunofluorescence","dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20080402","rdfs:label":"Immunofluorescence labeling"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityGeneExpressionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallFunctionalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:d5e4ff9a-94ad-453f-b2de-76deb98fe4ca_model_rescue_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1fac63bb-b351-4882-b396-468ef36bf615","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:47cb6c3c-09b5-4b88-bff1-029a01e1b419","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Mouse mimics severe phenotype seen in recessive RYR1-related myopathies\nEarly–onset muscle weakness/hypotrophy, premature death","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31107960","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Ryanodine receptor type I (RYR1)-related myopathies (RYR1 RM) are a clinically and histopathologically heterogeneous group of conditions that represent the most common subtype of childhood onset non-dystrophic muscle disorders. There are no treatments for this severe group of diseases. A major barrier to therapy development is the lack of an animal model that mirrors the clinical severity of pediatric cases of the disease. To address this, we used CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to generate a novel recessive mouse model of RYR1 RM. This mouse (Ryr1TM/Indel) possesses a patient-relevant point mutation (T4706M) engineered into 1 allele and a 16 base pair frameshift deletion engineered into the second allele. Ryr1TM/Indel mice exhibit an overt phenotype beginning at 14 days of age that consists of reduced body/muscle mass and myofibre hypotrophy. Ryr1TM/Indel mice become progressively inactive from that point onward and die at a median age of 42 days. Histopathological assessment shows myofibre hypotrophy, increased central nuclei and decreased triad number but no clear evidence of metabolic cores. Biochemical analysis reveals a marked decrease in RYR1 protein levels (20% of normal) as compared to only a 50% decrease in transcript. Functional studies at end stage show significantly reduced electrically evoked Ca2+ release and force production. In summary, Ryr1TM/Indel mice exhibit a post-natal lethal recessive form of RYR1 RM that pheno-copies the severe congenital clinical presentation seen in a subgroup of RYR1 RM children. Thus, Ryr1TM/Indel mice represent a powerful model for both establishing the pathomechanisms of recessive RYR1 RM and pre-clinical testing of therapies for efficacy.","dc:creator":"Brennan S","dc:date":"2019","dc:title":"Mouse model of severe recessive RYR1-related myopathy."},"rdfs:label":"Mouse Model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"Downgraded because no evidence of cores"},{"id":"cggv:de355055-68df-493c-a65c-5932fde97356","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:5b5e747d-a757-4908-b63e-be34bea7e709","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"Both mice and humans exhibit muscle weakness and reduced RYR1 levels in muscle tissue.

During the first 20 weeks after birth the body weight and the spontaneous running distance of the mutant mice were 20% and 50% lower compared to wild-type littermates.

Mutant RyR1 channels incorporated into lipid bilayers were less sensitive to calcium and caffeine, but no change in single-channel conductance was observed.

By contrast, relatively relaxed mutants swim slowly due to weak contractions of trunk muscles. Electrophysiological recordings from muscle showed that output from the CNS was normal in mutants, suggesting a defect in the muscle. Calcium imaging revealed that Ca(2+) transients were reduced in mutant fast muscle. Immunostaining demonstrated that ryanodine and dihydropyridine receptors, which are responsible for Ca(2+) release following membrane depolarization, were severely reduced at transverse-tubule/sarcoplasmic reticulum junctions in mutant fast muscle. Thus, slow swimming is caused by weak muscle contractions due to impaired excitation-contraction coupling. Indeed, most of the ryanodine receptor 1b (ryr1b) mRNA in mutants carried a nonsense mutation that was generated by aberrant splicing due to a DNA insertion in an intron of the ryr1b gene, leading to a hypomorphic condition in relatively relaxed mutants. RYR1 mutations in humans lead to a congenital myopathy, multi-minicore disease (MmD), which is defined by amorphous cores in muscle. Electron micrographs showed minicore structures in mutant fast muscles. Furthermore, following the introduction of antisense morpholino oligonucleotides that restored the normal splicing of ryr1b, swimming was recovered in mutants. These findings suggest that zebrafish relatively relaxed mutants may be useful for understanding the development and physiology of MmD.","dc:creator":"Hirata H","dc:date":"2007","dc:title":"Zebrafish relatively relaxed mutants have a ryanodine receptor defect, show slow swimming and provide a model of multi-minicore disease."},"rdfs:label":"Zebra Fish Model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Downgraded due to morpholino and because exact replication of human phenotype was not demonstrated"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":6}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":1147,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria7","strengthScore":18,"subject":{"id":"cggv:f2c532d1-c0f3-4a47-b0ba-479f8d593df7","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0100150","gene":"hgnc:10483","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.0","dc:description":"RYR1 was reported in relation to autosomal recessive RYR1-related myopathy in 2002 (Ferreiro et al., PMID:12112081).
