Generation of inner membrane domains requires the complex interplay between the respiratory complexes, mitochondrial lipids and the recently identified mitochondrial contact site and cristae organizing system (MICOS) complex. Proper organization of the mitochondrial inner membrane has recently been shown to be important for respiratory function in yeast. Here we aimed at a molecular diagnosis in a brother and sister from a consanguineous family who presented with a neurodegenerative disorder accompanied by hyperlactatemia, 3-methylglutaconic aciduria, disturbed hepatocellular function with abnormal cristae morphology in liver and cerebellar and vermis atrophy, which suggest mitochondrial dysfunction. Using homozygosity mapping and exome sequencing the patients were found to be homozygous for the p.(Gly15Glufs*75) variant in the QIL1/MIC13 (C19orf70) gene. QIL1/MIC13 is a constituent of MICOS, a six subunit complex that helps to form and/or stabilize cristae junctions and determine the placement, distribution and number of cristae within mitochondria. In patient fibroblasts both MICOS subunits QIL1/MIC13 and MIC10 were absent whereas MIC60 was present in a comparable abundance to that of the control. We conclude that QIL1/MIC13 deficiency in human, is associated with disassembly of the MICOS complex, with the associated aberration of cristae morphology and mitochondrial respiratory dysfunction. 3-Methylglutaconic aciduria is associated with variants in genes encoding mitochondrial inner membrane organizing determinants, including TAZ, DNAJC19, SERAC1 and QIL1/MIC13.","dc:creator":"Zeharia A","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"Mitochondrial hepato-encephalopathy due to deficiency of QIL1/MIC13 (C19orf70), a MICOS complex subunit."}},"rdfs:label":"Zeharia 2016 female 1"},{"id":"cggv:aa50b1d9-42f3-4ec8-9e0a-69f4a0ca2f69","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:aa50b1d9-42f3-4ec8-9e0a-69f4a0ca2f69_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:aa50b1d9-42f3-4ec8-9e0a-69f4a0ca2f69_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"NMD not expected but Western blot confirmed absent MIC13 protein in patient fibroblasts as well as absent MIC10 protein\n"}],"strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"1.5 (null) x2 (hom) "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:546a0faf-a11b-413e-9a02-493a16aa7323_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:546a0faf-a11b-413e-9a02-493a16aa7323","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDeath","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":3,"allele":{"id":"cggv:ac0b761a-3c05-4e00-8a98-6bfd3c2da368","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_205767.3(MICOS13):c.30-1G>A","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA403542832"}},"detectionMethod":"WES+Sanger confirmation, both parents confirmed het","firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001298","obo:HP_0001252","obo:HP_0000365","obo:HP_0008322","obo:HP_0008972","obo:HP_0000252","obo:HP_0001392","obo:HP_0003128","obo:HP_0000648","obo:HP_0000817","obo:HP_0000649","obo:HP_0002376","obo:HP_0001272","obo:HP_0001943"],"previousTesting":false,"sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:9ab54702-5ccb-4d6e-af63-f2b771607234_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:ac0b761a-3c05-4e00-8a98-6bfd3c2da368"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27623147","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Previously, we identified QIL1 as a subunit of mitochondrial contact site (MICOS) complex and demonstrated a role for QIL1 in MICOS assembly, mitochondrial respiration, and cristae formation critical for mitochondrial architecture (Guarani et al., 2015).

Several criteria such as pathway involvement and pathomechanisms were considered. The main purpose of the hierarchical, group-based approach of the ICIMD is an improved understanding of the interconnections between many individual conditions that may share functional, clinical, and diagnostic features. The ICIMD aims to include any primary genetic condition in which alteration of a biochemical pathway is intrinsic to specific biochemical, clinical, and/or pathophysiological features.

The MICOS13 protein is needed for maintenance of crista junctions, cristae morphology and inner membrane architecture, and formation of contact sites to the outer mitochondrial membrane. Of note, the *MICOS13* gene has previously been referred to as *QIL*1 or *C19ORF70*.\n\nThe *MICOS13* gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive primary mitochondrial disease in 2016 (PMIDs: 27485409, 27623147) in individuals with early-onset encephalopathy and liver disease. While various names have been given to the constellation of features seen in those with *MICOS13*-related disease, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *MICOS13* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework.\n\nEvidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included four unique homozygous variants (two frameshift, two splice) reported in four unrelated individuals in four publications (PMIDs: 27485409, 27623147, 32749073, 29618761). Variants co-segregated with disease in two additional family members in two families. Additional cases are available in the literature, but the maximum for genetic evidence has been reached. Affected individuals typically present in the infantile or early childhood period and features seen in affected individuals include small for gestational age, intrauterine growth restriction, microcephaly, seizures, neurologic deterioration, failure to thrive, liver disease, sensorineural hearing loss, optic atrophy, lactic acidosis, 3-methylglutaconic aciduria, and cerebellar and vermis atrophy. Skeletal muscle, fibroblasts, and/or liver showed decreased activities of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes I, III, and IV. The mechanism of disease appears to be loss of function.\n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by a biochemical function shared with other genes associated with primary mitochondrial disease; evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired MICOS complex assembly following knockdown in non-patient cells; rescue of MICOS complex assembly and mitochondrial function via expression of wild-type in patient cells; and recapitulation of mitochondrial morphology defects observed in patient tissue in a Drosophila muscle- and neuron-specific knockdown model (PMIDs: 33340416, 27623147, 32749073, 25997101). \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between *MICOS13* and autosomal recessive primary mitochondrial disease. This relationship has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on August 7, 2023 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:2b19a224-a6a5-4056-b69d-2d3090b8a9e6"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
