Three candidate disease genes are proposed, supported by a combination of genetic and in vivo studies. Aggregate analysis of mutation data revealed a significantly increased number of rare variants across 58 neuropathy-associated genes in subjects versus controls, confirmed in a second ethnically discrete neuropathy cohort, suggesting that mutation burden potentially contributes to phenotypic variability. Neuropathy genes shown to have highly penetrant Mendelizing variants (HPMVs) and implicated by burden in families were shown to interact genetically in a zebrafish assay exacerbating the phenotype established by the suppression of single genes.

In the last years few families affected with demyelinating Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy (CMT1), caused by PMP2 mutations, have been identified. In this study we describe the first case of a PMP2 in-frame deletion. PMP2 was analyzed by direct sequencing after exclusion of the most frequent CMT-associated genes by using a next generation sequencing (NGS) genes panel. Sanger sequencing was used for family's segregation analysis. Molecular modeling analysis was used to evaluate the mutation impact on the protein structure. A novel PMP2: p.I50del has been identified in a child with early onset CMT1 and in three affected family members. All family members show an early onset demyelinating neuropathy without other distinguish features. Molecular modeling analysis and in silico evaluations do not suggest a strong impact on the overall protein structure, but a most likely altered protein function. This study suggests the importance to add PMP2 in CMT NGS genes panels or, at most, to test it after major CMT1 genes exclusion, due to the lack of diagnostic-addressing additional features.","dc:creator":"Geroldi A","dc:date":"2020","dc:title":"Early onset demyelinating Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease caused by a novel in-frame isoleucine deletion in peripheral myelin protein 2."}},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32277537","rdfs:label":"GEIII-1"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProbandADNonNullCriteria","strengthScore":0.1,"dc:description":"Non-null variant with no variant-level evidence"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalDominantOtherVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":0.6},{"id":"cggv:aa4c5730-f807-45d7-afe7-573a3960916f_ad_dn_el","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:e9f6a64c-1cac-4ab2-9ca1-7575d701a8d3_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:af160409-b148-408a-a8c4-44a61e778f6e","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDiagnosis","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":17,"detectionMethod":"Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood.

At least six variants (e.g. missense, in-frame indel) have been reported in humans. Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, limited segregation data, and experimental data. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least eight probands in six publications (PMIDs: 26257172, 27009151, 30249361, 31412900, 26828946, 32277537). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in several additional family members, however the lack of significant segregation in a single family yields no scorable segregation evidence. The mechanism for disease is suspected to be a monoallelic gain-of-function or dominant negative effect with variants affecting the myelin structure or causing upregulation of the protein (PMID: 28747762). This gene-disease association is additionally supported by PMP2's function in lipid homeostasis and remyelination, as well as functional evidence in PMP2 null mice. Expression of PMP2 in myelin, interacting with MPZ, a protein also associated with demyelinating CMT, also provides evidence towards its pathogenicity. A transgenic mouse model expressing the I43N variant does recapitulate many of the phenotypes observed in humans. However, the possibility for interference via overexpression, rather than from the variant itself, requires more clarification in future studies.  In summary, there is limited evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. While more evidence is needed to establish this relationship definitively, no convincing contradictory evidence has emerged.","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:aa4c5730-f807-45d7-afe7-573a3960916f"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
