To uncover further genes with high-penetrance causative mutations, we performed exome sequencing of leukocyte DNA from 102 unrelated individuals with unexplained adenomatous polyposis. We identified two unrelated individuals with differing compound-heterozygous loss-of-function (LoF) germline mutations in the mismatch-repair gene MSH3. The impact of the MSH3 mutations (c.1148delA, c.2319-1G>A, c.2760delC, and c.3001-2A>C) was indicated at the RNA and protein levels. Analysis of the diseased individuals' tumor tissue demonstrated high microsatellite instability of di- and tetranucleotides (EMAST), and immunohistochemical staining illustrated a complete loss of nuclear MSH3 in normal and tumor tissue, confirming the LoF effect and causal relevance of the mutations. The pedigrees, genotypes, and frequency of MSH3 mutations in the general population are consistent with an autosomal-recessive mode of inheritance. Both index persons have an affected sibling carrying the same mutations. The tumor spectrum in these four persons comprised colorectal and duodenal adenomas, colorectal cancer, gastric cancer, and an early-onset astrocytoma. Additionally, we detected one unrelated individual with biallelic PMS2 germline mutations, representing constitutional mismatch-repair deficiency. Potentially causative variants in 14 more candidate genes identified in 26 other individuals require further workup. In the present study, we identified biallelic germline MSH3 mutations in individuals with a suspected hereditary tumor syndrome. Our data suggest that MSH3 mutations represent an additional recessive subtype of colorectal adenomatous polyposis.

High levels of MSI at mononucleotide and dinucleotide repeats in colorectal cancer (CRC) are attributed to inactivation of the MMR genes, hMLH1 and hMSH2. CRC with low levels of MSI (MSI-L) exists; however, its molecular basis is unclear. There is another type of MSI--elevated microsatellite alterations at selected tetranucleotide repeats (EMAST)--where loci containing [AAAG](n) or [ATAG](n) repeats are unstable. EMAST is frequent in non-CRCs; however, the incidence of EMAST and its cause in CRC is not known. Here, we report that MutS homologue 3 (MSH3) knockdown or MSH3-deficient cells exhibit the EMAST phenotype and low levels of mutations at dinucleotide repeats. About 60% of 117 sporadic CRC cases exhibit EMAST. All of the cases defined as MSI-H (16 cases) exhibited high levels of EMAST. Among 101 non-MSI-H cases, all 19 cases of MSI-L and 35 of 82 cases of MSS exhibited EMAST. Although non-MSI-H CRC tissues contained MSH3-negative tumor cells ranging from 2% to 50% of the total tumor cell population, the tissues exhibiting EMAST contained more MSH3-negative cells (average, 31.5%) than did the tissues not exhibiting EMAST (8.4%).

Survival of Msh3/p53 mice was not reduced compared with p53 single mutant mice; however, the tumor spectrum changed significantly from lymphoma to sarcoma, indicating MSH3 as a potent modulator of p53-driven tumorigenesis. Interestingly, Msh3(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts displayed increased chromatid breaks and persistence of γH2AX foci following ionizing radiation, indicating a defect in DNA double-strand break repair (DSBR).

These complexes have specific and redundant mismatch recognition capacity. Whereas MSH2 deficiency ablates the activity of both dimers, causing strong cancer predisposition in mice and men, loss of MSH3 or MSH6 (also known as GTBP) function causes a partial MMR defect. This may explain the rarity of MSH6 and absence of MSH3 germline mutations in HNPCC families. To test this, we have inactivated the mouse genes Msh3 (formerly Rep3 ) and Msh6 (formerly Gtmbp). Msh6-deficient mice were prone to cancer; most animals developed lymphomas or epithelial tumours originating from the skin and uterus but only rarely from the intestine. Msh3 deficiency did not cause cancer predisposition, but in an Msh6 -deficient background, loss of Msh3 accelerated intestinal tumorigenesis. Lymphomagenesis was not affected. Furthermore, mismatch-directed anti-recombination and sensitivity to methylating agents required Msh2 and Msh6, but not Msh3. Thus, loss of MMR functions specific to Msh2/Msh6 is sufficient for lymphoma development in mice, whereas predisposition to intestinal cancer requires loss of function of both Msh2/Msh6 and Msh2/Msh3.","dc:creator":"de Wind N","dc:date":"1999","dc:title":"HNPCC-like cancer predisposition in mice through simultaneous loss of Msh3 and Msh6 mismatch-repair protein functions."},"rdfs:label":"MSH3-/- / MSH6-/- mouse model (Table 1)"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"Awarding 1 point (instead of default 2 points) per GCEP recommendation."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":3}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":6},{"id":"cggv:3ec777aa-af6a-4cc6-ace1-b22e4b493457_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a7ea82f5-9cd3-4088-a7ff-31c239425a01_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:a7ea82f5-9cd3-4088-a7ff-31c239425a01","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDiagnosis","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":70,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:9075b552-016f-4575-a784-4f4fb8d891a8","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_002439.5(MSH3):c.3130+3A>G","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/666138"}},{"id":"cggv:1f95adb7-eabb-4e86-b9f0-84c155d024e6","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_002439.5(MSH3):c.978_984del (p.Phe326fs)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/657893"}}],"firstTestingMethod":"Next generation sequencing panels","phenotypeFreeText":"Endometrial cancer, microsatellite stable ","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0003002","obo:HP_0200063"],"sex":"Female","variant":[{"id":"cggv:ff264f3a-0d7b-43bd-b1dc-399a2db39723_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:1f95adb7-eabb-4e86-b9f0-84c155d024e6"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34250384","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:creator":"Salo-Mullen EE","dc:date":"2021","dc:title":"Prevalence and Characterization of Biallelic and Monoallelic "}},{"id":"cggv:f52fa948-7757-4c36-8331-3f4c5918058c_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:9075b552-016f-4575-a784-4f4fb8d891a8"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34250384"}],"rdfs:label":"1M"},{"id":"cggv:f52fa948-7757-4c36-8331-3f4c5918058c","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f52fa948-7757-4c36-8331-3f4c5918058c_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1},{"id":"cggv:ff264f3a-0d7b-43bd-b1dc-399a2db39723","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ff264f3a-0d7b-43bd-b1dc-399a2db39723_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:7bb58785-2734-419c-a941-62164d714321_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7bb58785-2734-419c-a941-62164d714321","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtDiagnosis","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":40,"allele":{"id":"cggv:38faa482-42ac-427a-a0d0-c978bad17459","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NC_000005.10:g.(?_80775684)_(80775768_?)del","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/665026"}},"firstTestingMethod":"Next generation sequencing panels","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0003002","obo:HP_0005562","obo:HP_0001407","obo:HP_0200063"],"previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"HBOC multigene panel negative","sex":"Female","variant":{"id":"cggv:1c08ceb9-91e5-4f3d-8afe-52c3ec7f534f_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:38faa482-42ac-427a-a0d0-c978bad17459"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37597744","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Recently, biallelic MSH3 germline pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants have been recognized as a rare cause of adenomatous polyposis.

We describe the phenotype of a third family, the largest thus far, with adenomatous polyposis related to compound heterozygous MSH3 pathogenic variants. The index patient was a 55-years old male diagnosed with rectal cancer and adenomatous polyposis (cumulatively 52 polyps), with a family history of colorectal polyposis with unknown cause. Next-generation sequencing and copy number variation analysis of a panel of genes associated with colorectal cancer and polyposis revealed compound heterozygous germline pathogenic variants in the MSH3 gene. Nine out of 11 siblings were genotyped. Three siblings carried the same compound heterozygous MSH3 variants. Colonoscopy screening showed predominantly right-sided adenomatous polyposis in all compound heterozygous siblings, with a cumulative number of adenomas ranging from 18 to 54 in an average of four colonoscopies, and age at first adenoma detection ranging from 46 to 59. Microsatellite analysis demonstrated alterations at selected tetranucleotide repeats (EMAST) in DNA retrieved from the rectal adenocarcinoma, colorectal adenomas as well as of normal colonic mucosa. Gastro-duodenoscopy did not reveal adenomas in any of the four patients. Extra-intestinal findings included a ductal adenocarcinoma in ectopic breast tissue in one female sibling at the age of 46, and liver cysts in three affected siblings. None of the three heterozygous or wild type siblings who previously underwent colonoscopy had adenomatous polyposis. We conclude that biallelic variants in MSH3 are a rare cause of attenuated adenomatous polyposis with an onset in middle age.","dc:creator":"Aelvoet AS","dc:date":"2023","dc:title":"A large family with MSH3-related polyposis."}},{"id":"cggv:3a1a6645-9065-45ca-836d-4c188a2ca48b_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:2d666466-f0cc-41d6-a1c6-02d66d39116f"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35675019"}],"rdfs:label":"P1 Aelvoet"},{"id":"cggv:54bc3f26-7374-481d-8c78-c4b1169e2e4b","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:54bc3f26-7374-481d-8c78-c4b1169e2e4b_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:54bc3f26-7374-481d-8c78-c4b1169e2e4b_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"No","dc:description":"NMD prone"}],"strengthScore":1.5},{"id":"cggv:3a1a6645-9065-45ca-836d-4c188a2ca48b","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3a1a6645-9065-45ca-836d-4c188a2ca48b_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallGeneticEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":8917,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria10","strengthScore":18,"subject":{"id":"cggv:ee1a37bd-11a8-4e4c-880b-5abec2f22bd7","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0044300","gene":"hgnc:7326","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"3.0","dc:description":"MSH3 was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive familial adenomatous polyposis 4 in 2016 (Adam et al., PMID: 27476653). MSH3-related familial adenomatous polyposis 4 is characterized by attenuated polyposis and increased susceptibility to colorectal cancer. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found differences in inheritance pattern and phenotypic variability. Therefore, the gene-disease relationship between MSH3 - Lynch syndrome (MONDO:0005835) and autosomal recessive FAP4 was curated separately. Nineteen variants (nonsense, frameshift, large deletion, splicing, missense) that have been reported in 10 probands in 6 publications (PMIDs 27476653, 37597744, 35675019, 38243056, 34250384, 37402566) are included in this curation. The mechanism of pathogenicity is known to be loss of function. This gene-disease relationship is also supported by expression studies, in vitro functional assays, and animal models (PMIDs: 18922920, 24013230, 10706084, 27476653). These studies show that biallelic loss of MSH3 leads to impaired DNA double strand break repair and formation of presumably microsatellite-stable adenomas that contain a unique EMAST signature (a distinct form of microsatellite instability). Knockout mouse models display increased intestinal tumor formation. In summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between MSH3 and autosomal recessive familial adenomatous polyposis 4. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This gene-disease pair was originally evaluated as Moderate by the Hereditary Cancer GCEP on March 6, 2024. This re-curation at Definitive was approved by the ClinGen Hereditary Cancer GCEP on May 24, 2024 (SOP Version 10).\nMultiple replicated reports","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:3ec777aa-af6a-4cc6-ace1-b22e4b493457"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
