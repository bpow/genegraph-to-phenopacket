Eight BBS genes representing all known mapped loci have been identified. Mutation analysis of the known BBS genes in BBS patients indicate that additional BBS genes exist and/or that unidentified mutations exist in the known genes. To identify new BBS genes, we performed homozygosity mapping of small, consanguineous BBS pedigrees, using moderately dense SNP arrays. A bioinformatics approach combining comparative genomic analysis and gene expression studies of a BBS-knockout mouse model was used to prioritize BBS candidate genes within the newly identified loci for mutation screening. By use of this strategy, parathyroid hormone-responsive gene B1 (B1) was found to be a novel BBS gene (BBS9), supported by the identification of homozygous mutations in BBS patients. The identification of BBS9 illustrates the power of using a combination of comparative genomic analysis, gene expression studies, and homozygosity mapping with SNP arrays in small, consanguineous families for the identification of rare autosomal recessive disorders. We also demonstrate that small, consanguineous families are useful in identifying intragenic deletions. This type of mutation is likely to be underreported because of the difficulty of deletion detection in the heterozygous state by the mutation screening methods that are used in many studies.","dc:creator":"Nishimura DY","dc:date":"2005","dc:title":"Comparative genomics and gene expression analysis identifies BBS9, a new Bardet-Biedl syndrome gene."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:3fc68f9f-ed7c-453e-8c41-179a9ccad0ca_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:14e86a00-e687-4e26-992d-4a9450cf4cde_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:14e86a00-e687-4e26-992d-4a9450cf4cde","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":14,"allele":{"id":"cggv:c46576e8-2f39-4cbe-ba4a-fd98bcfe4934","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_198428.3(BBS9):c.1789+1G>A","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA252383"}},"ethnicity":{"id":"cg:UnknownEthnicity"},"firstTestingMethod":"Next generation sequencing panels","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0002013","obo:HP_0000662","obo:HP_0000618","obo:HP_0001513","obo:HP_0010442","obo:HP_0001156","obo:HP_0000135","obo:HP_0002039","obo:HP_0001159","obo:HP_0000843"],"previousTesting":false,"secondTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:34754c90-f416-409c-afb3-d6ed27230a70_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:c46576e8-2f39-4cbe-ba4a-fd98bcfe4934"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32165602","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Bardet- biedl syndrome (BBS) is a rare heterogenous autosomal recessive disease due to defects in primary cilia which until now, up to 21 types have been detected.

Though BBS9 (also known as PTHB1) is reportedly a component of BBSome, its direct function has not yet been elucidated. Using zebrafish as a model, we show that knockdown of bbs9 with specific antisense morpholinos leads to developmental abnormalities in retina and brain including hydrocephaly that are consistent with the core phenotypes observed in syndromic ciliopathies. Knockdown of bbs9 also causes reduced number and length of cilia in Kupffer's vesicle. We also demonstrate that an orthologous human BBS9 mRNA, but not one carrying a missense mutation identified in BBS patients, can rescue the bbs9 morphant phenotype.

Multiple alternatively spliced isoforms of *PTHB1* are expressed in different tissues. Independent genetic studies, involving comparative mapping and gene expression analysis, led to the identification of *PTHB1* as a novel gene associated with Bardet-Biedl syndrome (Nishimura et al., 2005, PMID: 16380913).\n\nBardet-Biedl syndrome 9 (MIM#: 615986) is typically an autosomal recessive disorder that exhibits variable expressivity and phenotypes including retinopathy, mental retardation, obesity, polydactyly, and renal abnormalities. The main alterations observed are nonsense variants along the gene (34%). Additionally, frameshift, splice site variants and large deletions, all leading to a truncated protein, summarize up to 80% of all known variants. Consequently, the main disease causing mechanism may be a loss of function of the BBS9 protein (PMID: 33771153, PMID: 34212515, PMID: 32165602, PMID: 26846096).\n\nThe reported variant spectrum in *BBS9* includes 21 missense, 49 nonsense, 35 frameshift, 33 splice defects, and 4 exon deletions (PMID: 33771153). Altogether, variants in *BBS9* account for ∼6% of BBS cases. Because the published cases exhibit a recessive mode of inheritance and share overlapping retinal phenotypes consistent with a single spectrum of disease, this curation has lumped these cases into a single disease entity, BBS9-related ciliopathy.\n\nThis curation has collected data from 3 consanguineous families and 1 isolated individual with 4 unique variants (PMID: 33771153, PMID: 34212515, PMID: 32165602, PMID: 26846096). Additional experimental evidence was found in studies of expression, biochemical function and animal model systems (PMID: 22479622, PMID: 16380913). Although the BBS9 protein has been shown to be a part of the Bardet-Biedl syndrome protein complex (BBSome) core, its precise physiological function has not been delineated, and the mechanism of disease pathogenesis caused by *BBS9* variants remains poorly understood. The BBSome is an octameric complex that transports membrane proteins into the primary cilium signaling organelle in eukaryotes and is implicated in human disease. The 99-kDa human BBS9 protein is one of the eight BBSome components. It is composed of four structured domains, including a β-stranded N-terminal domain (PMID: 26085087). Experimental studies in zebrafish have provided strong evidence in support of the role of BBS9 in cilia development as its morpholino-based knockdown results in a BBS-like syndromic phenotype in zebrafish. An orthologous human *BBS9* mRNA rescued the morphant phenotype, while a mutant mRNA failed to provide functional complementation, suggesting an evolutionary conservation of BBS9 function (PMID: 16380913, PMID: 22479622).\n\nIn summary, *BBS9* is definitively associated with BBS9-related ciliopathy, in which one of the major features is retinal cone-rod dystrophy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This clinical validity classification was approved by the ClinGen Retina Gene Curation Expert Panel on August 3rd, 2023 (ClinGen Gene Clinical Validity Framework SOP verison 9).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:3fc68f9f-ed7c-453e-8c41-179a9ccad0ca"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
