This is a rare condition, previously reported in only four families. In contrast, heterozygous GRN mutations are a major cause of frontotemporal dementia associated with neuronal cytoplasmic TDP-43 inclusions. We identified homozygous GRN mutations in six new patients. The phenotypic spectrum is much broader than previously reported, with two remarkably distinct presentations, depending on the age of onset. A childhood/juvenile form is characterized by classical CLN11 symptoms at an early age at onset. Unexpectedly, other homozygous patients presented a distinct delayed phenotype of frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonism after 50 years; none had epilepsy or cerebellar ataxia. Another major finding of this study is that all GRN mutations may not have the same impact on progranulin protein synthesis. A hypomorphic effect of some mutations is supported by the presence of residual levels of plasma progranulin and low levels of normal transcript detected in one case with a homozygous splice-site mutation and late onset frontotemporal dementia. This is a new critical finding that must be considered in therapeutic trials based on replacement strategies. The first neuropathological study in a homozygous carrier provides new insights into the pathological mechanisms of the disease. Hallmarks of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis were present. The absence of TDP-43 cytoplasmic inclusions markedly differs from observations of heterozygous mutations, suggesting a pathological shift between lysosomal and TDP-43 pathologies depending on the mono or bi-allelic status. An intriguing observation was the loss of normal TDP-43 staining in the nucleus of some neurons, which could be the first stage of the TDP-43 pathological process preceding the formation of typical cytoplasmic inclusions. Finally, this study has important implications for genetic counselling and molecular diagnosis. Semi-dominant inheritance of GRN mutations implies that specific genetic counselling should be delivered to children and parents of CLN11 patients, as they are heterozygous carriers with a high risk of developing dementia. More broadly, this study illustrates the fact that genetic variants can lead to different phenotypes according to their mono- or bi-allelic state, which is a challenge for genetic diagnosis.","dc:creator":"Huin V","dc:date":"2020","dc:title":"Homozygous GRN mutations: new phenotypes and new insights into pathological and molecular mechanisms."}},"rdfs:label":"AAR-427"},{"id":"cggv:feec6f57-e9c7-49fb-ae91-2b74ba5ef785","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:feec6f57-e9c7-49fb-ae91-2b74ba5ef785_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:8421dec5-47da-42f3-af60-d2b0b6437da0_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8421dec5-47da-42f3-af60-d2b0b6437da0","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":25,"allele":{"id":"cggv:e50a9a0a-81dd-46de-9a2e-ff7695ecc8f7","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_002087.4(GRN):c.900_901dup (p.Ser301CysfsTer?)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA2261354150"}},"detectionMethod":"Single site variant testing ","ethnicity":{"id":"cg:NotHispanicOrLatino"},"firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0000556","obo:HP_0000529","obo:HP_0001251","obo:HP_0001260","obo:HP_0007360"],"previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"Unspecified genetic testing prior to publication.

Here, we describe the first case of NCL caused by a homozygous progranulin mutation segregating in a family with neuropathological confirmed FTLD. In this FTLD-NCL family, we detail the clinical phenotype, neuropsychological evaluation and imaging data of our proband harboring a homozygous mutation, c.900_901dupGT, with serum progranulin level (<6 ng/mL). Symptoms included rapidly progressive visual deficit, slightly dysarthria, and cerebellar ataxia. The electroretinogram confirmed a severe attenuation of rod and cone responses compatible with retinal dystrophy diagnosis and magnetic resonance imaging showed severe global cerebellar atrophy. In contrast, heterozygous relatives presented behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and some also developed extrapyramidal features compatible with corticobasal syndrome. Our findings suggest the importance of assessing serum progranulin levels in suspected recessive adult-onset NCL cases. Overall, a more holistic neurologic intervention is needed to guarantee a proper genetic counseling in cases like the present family where two distinct phenotypes are generated according to the individuals' mutation state.

Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found differences in inheritance pattern and phenotypic variability for these assertions. Therefore, these assertions have been split into the following disease entities: autosomal dominant frontotemporal dementia and autosomal recessive neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL). This curation for autosomal recessive neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis does not include probands with autosomal dominant frontotemporal dementia. \n\nNCL is a lysosomal storage disorder. Individuals with *GRN* related NCL present with a spectrum of features including seizures, cerebellar ataxia, retinitis pigmentosa and cognitive disorders. The presence and onset of these features is variable with some individuals presenting as early as childhood and others not presenting until late adulthood (PMIDs: 31855245, 31855245 respectively). Biallelic loss of function variants have been commonly reported in individuals with disease and seven variants reported across eight probands are included in this curation (PMIDs: 22608501, 24779634, 27021778, 28000352, 30922528, 31855245). In all instances of literature when available, affected probands with *GRN* variants are identified to have low or absent progranulin with normal levels found in unaffected family members, consistent with a loss of function mechanism of disease. More genetic evidence may be available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. Evidence supporting this gene disease pair also includes experimental data. Supporting experimental data in knockout mice has demonstrated that variants in this gene result in the accumulation of lipofuscin which causes NCL (PMID:28404863). \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *GRN* and autosomal recessive neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.This classification was approved by the ClinGen Epilepsy GCEP on the meeting date January 3, 2023. As of January 24, 2023, this record underwent an administrative update to change the disease term to a gene-agnostic term and to make minimal edits to the evidence summary for clarity (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:49eb0915-acff-423d-a70f-d00d4319d404"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
