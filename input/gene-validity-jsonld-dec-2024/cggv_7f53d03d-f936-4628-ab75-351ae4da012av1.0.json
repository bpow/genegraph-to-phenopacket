They exist as active dimers of alpha- and/or beta-subunits. A defect of their beta-subunit results in Sandhoff disease (O-variant GM2 gangliosidosis), an inherited, clinically heterogeneous, lysosomal storage disease. The status of the HEXB gene, pre beta-polypeptide chain mRNA, and residual beta-hexosaminidase activities were examined in a clinically and ethnically diverse collection of 16 fibroblast cell lines from patients with Sandhoff disease. Differentiation of the two major clinical types, infantile and juvenile onset, could be made by the determination of the activity of the residual beta-hexosaminidase eluting in the same pH range as hexosaminidase A. All the juvenile lines were found to have normal or reduced levels of pre beta-chain mRNA and no gross abnormalities in the HEXB gene. Of the 11 infantile type cell lines examined, four were found to contain no detectable pre beta-chain mRNA. Two cell lines in this group contained partial gene deletions localized to the 5' end of the HEXB gene. One of these cell lines has previously been assigned to the single complementation group in Sandhoff disease, conclusively demonstrating that the primary gene defect in the majority of Sandhoff cases is in the HEXB gene itself. These data suggest that each clinical group is made up of a collection of different HEXB mutations.","dc:creator":"O'Dowd BF","dc:date":"1986","dc:title":"Molecular heterogeneity in the infantile and juvenile forms of Sandhoff disease (O-variant GM2 gangliosidosis)."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7f53d03d-f936-4628-ab75-351ae4da012a_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7f53d03d-f936-4628-ab75-351ae4da012a_ar_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalRecessiveVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12},{"id":"cggv:393129ef-3a5a-460c-8934-64fad315b6b0_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:393129ef-3a5a-460c-8934-64fad315b6b0","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:9103c6e0-9d51-4388-b339-7ed99e3ace48","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000521.4(HEXB):c.534_537del (p.Leu178PhefsTer28)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA560766108"}},"detectionMethod":"Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes or cultured fibroblasts with Imp DNA blood Mini Kit.

We identified 11 different mutations of which six are novel: one large deletion of 2,406 nt, (c.299+1471_408del2406), one frameshift mutation c.965delT (p.I322fsX32), one nonsense c.1372C>T (p.Q458X), and three splicing mutations (c.299G>T, c.300-2A>G and c.512-1G>T). One allele was only characterized at the messenger RNA (mRNA) level (r = 1170_1242del). Real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis of the HEXB mRNA from fibroblasts derived from patients carrying the novel point mutations showed that the presence of the premature termination codon in the transcript bearing the mutation c.965delT triggers the nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) pathway, which results in the degradation of the aberrant mRNA. The presence of the c.299G>T mutation leads to the degradation of the mutated mRNA by a mechanism other than NMD, while mutations c.300-2A>G and c.512-1G>T cause the expression of aberrant transcripts. In our group, the most frequent mutation was c.850C>T (p.R284X) representing 29% of the alleles. Haplotype analysis suggested that this mutation did not originate from a single genetic event. Interestingly, the common 16-kb deletion mutation was absent. This work provides valuable information regarding the molecular genetics of SD in Italy and provides new insights into the molecular basis of the disease.","dc:creator":"Zampieri S","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"Molecular and functional analysis of the HEXB gene in Italian patients affected with Sandhoff disease: identification of six novel alleles."}},"rdfs:label":"Zampieri_SD1"},{"id":"cggv:d9dc3106-0b47-4a53-b857-6500e13e15d6","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d9dc3106-0b47-4a53-b857-6500e13e15d6_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:d9dc3106-0b47-4a53-b857-6500e13e15d6_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"This mutation is associated with a dramatic decrease of HEXB mRNA levels."}],"strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"This proband has a frameshift variant, Leu178PhefsTer28, which causes a 4-bp deletion and leads to a stop codon in exon 5.

Only the alpha-subunit (encoded by HEXA) active site can hydrolyze GM2 gangliosides due to a flexible loop structure that is removed post-translationally from beta, and to the presence of alphaAsn423 and alphaArg424. The loop structure is involved in binding the GM2 activator protein (encoded by GM2A), while alphaArg424 is critical for binding the carboxylate group of the N-acetyl-neuraminic acid residue of GM2. The beta-subunit (encoded by HEXB) lacks these key residues and has betaAsp452 and betaLeu453 in their place; the beta-subunit therefore cleaves only neutral substrates efficiently. Variants in the alpha-subunit cause Tay-Sachs disease, and those in the GM2 activator protein cause GM2 activator deficiency. Both are other forms of GM2 gangliosidosis and cause similar symptoms to Sandhoff disease.

NGT, a mechanism-based inhibitor, has been shown to act as a chemical chaperone that, to some extent, prevents misfolding of a Hex A mutant associated with adult onset Tay Sachs disease and, as a result, increases the residual activity of Hex A to a level above the critical threshold for disease. The crystal structure of Hex A reveals an alphabeta heterodimer, with each subunit having a functional active site. Only the alpha-subunit active site can hydrolyze GM2 gangliosides due to a flexible loop structure that is removed post-translationally from beta, and to the presence of alphaAsn423 and alphaArg424. The loop structure is involved in binding the GM2 activator protein, while alphaArg424 is critical for binding the carboxylate group of the N-acetyl-neuraminic acid residue of GM2. The beta-subunit lacks these key residues and has betaAsp452 and betaLeu453 in their place; the beta-subunit therefore cleaves only neutral substrates efficiently. Mutations in the alpha-subunit, associated with TSD, and those in the beta-subunit, associated with SD are discussed. The effect of NGT binding in the active site of a mutant Hex A and its effect on protein function is discussed.","dc:creator":"Lemieux MJ","dc:date":"2006","dc:title":"Crystallographic structure of human beta-hexosaminidase A: interpretation of Tay-Sachs mutations and loss of GM2 ganglioside hydrolysis."},"rdfs:label":"HEXB interactions"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"The score is increased because the functions of these three genes (HEXA, HEXB, and GM2A), their gene products, and their role in GM2-gangliosidosis is well-characterized (for review, see PMID 29152458)."},{"id":"cggv:8ba65ce8-58bb-466d-bcbc-b59f1c6490a3","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0ffddcc4-8058-49b6-b6fa-7d2acdf4fb6e","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"},"dc:description":"Three proteins are necessary for the hydrolysis of GM2-ganglioside.

Thus, any interruption of HEXB produces a deficiency in both isozymes. Deficiency of any one of these proteins leads to storage of gangliosides, primarily in the lysosomes of neuronal cells.  \nTherefore, deficiency of HexB is expected to result in reduced hexosaminidase activity, and subsequent accumulation of GM2-ganglioside in neuronal cells.

A deficiency of any one of these proteins leads to storage of the ganglioside, primarily in the lysosomes of neuronal cells, and one of the three forms of GM2-gangliosidosis, Tay-Sachs disease, Sandhoff disease or the AB-variant form. Studies of the biochemical impact of naturally occurring mutations associated with the GM2 gangliosidoses on mRNA splicing and stability, and on the intracellular transport and stability of the affected protein have provided some general insights into these complex cellular mechanisms. However, such studies have revealed little in the way of structure-function information on the proteins. It appears that the detrimental effect of most mutations is not specifically on functional elements of the protein, but rather on the proteins' overall folding and/or intracellular transport. The few exceptions to this generalization are missense mutations at two codons in HEXA, causing the unique biochemical phenotype known as the B1-variant, and one codon in both the HEXB and GM2A genes. Biochemical characterization of these mutations has led to the localization of functional residues and/or domains within each of the encoded proteins.","dc:creator":"Mahuran DJ","dc:date":"1999","dc:title":"Biochemical consequences of mutations causing the GM2 gangliosidoses."},"rdfs:label":"HEXB function "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityBiochemicalFunctionCriteria","strengthScore":2,"dc:description":"The function of HEXB in the pathogenesis of Sandhoff disease is well understood based on a large body of research.

HEXB encodes the beta subunit of the enzyme hexosaminidase which is involved in the breakdown of GM2-gangliosides. A deficiency of Hex B results in reduced hexosaminidase activity, and subsequent accumulation of GM2-gangliosides in neuronal cells. Accumulation of GM2-gangliosides in neuronal cells causes various symptoms including developmental regression, exaggerated startle response, and a cherry-red spot on the macula. Sandhoff disease has a phenotypic continuum and can be divided into three clinical phenotypes: acute infantile, subacute juvenile, and late-onset SD. The diagnosis of Sandhoff disease is established by abnormally low enzymatic activity of hexosaminidases A and B, and identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in HEXB by molecular genetic testing (Xiao et al., 2022, PMID: 35420740).\n\nSix variants (1 missense, 1 splice site, 2 nonsense, 2 frameshift) that have been reported in five probands in two publications (Zampieri S, et al., 2009, PMID: 18758829; Alonso-Pérez J et al., 2021, PMID: 34210542) are included in this curation. Individuals with two null variants typically have the acute infantile phenotype, whereas individuals with one null and one missense variant typically have the subacute juvenile phenotype, and individuals with two missense variants typically have the late-onset phenotype (Xiao et al., 2022, PMID: 35420740). More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. The mechanism of pathogenicity is loss of function.\n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by experimental evidence including animal models systems, rescue in animal models, protein interaction, and biochemical function of the HexB enzyme. Individuals with Sandhoff disease show accumulation of GM2 gangliosides in the neurons due to reduced or undetectable levels of hexosaminidase activity (Mahuran DJ, 1999, PMID: 10571007). The gene product of HEXB interacts with HEXA and GM2A which have both been implicated in other forms of GM2 gangliosidosis and exhibit symptoms similar to Sandhoff disease (Lemieux MJ, et al., 2006, PMID: 16698036). Zebrafish show loss of enzyme activity, accumulation of oligosaccharides, lysosomal abnormalities in glia and reduced locomotor activity, similar to the molecular, cellular, neuropathological, and motility aspects of Sandhoff disease in humans. Hexb deficient zebrafish seem to recapitulate early disease stages, but lack extensive neurodegeneration (Kuil LE et al., 2019, PMID: 31140649). Knockout mouse models displayed biochemical and clinical features similar to those seen in humans with Sandhoff disease (Phaneuf D, et al., 1996, PMID: 8789434; Sango K, et al., 1995, PMID: 7550345) Gene therapy in mice partially restored hexb activity in the brain, which had the following effects: normalized lysosomal function, corrected lipid storage, prevented GM2 storage, prevented neuroinflammation, and restored a normal lifespan and locomotor function (Niemir N, et al., 2018, PMID: 29325092; Dogbevia G, et al., 2020, PMID: 31357902).\n\nIn summary, HEXB is definitively associated with Sandhoff disease. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Lysosomal Diseases Gene Curation Expert Panel on the meeting date 9/15/2022 (SOP Version 9). \n","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:7f53d03d-f936-4628-ab75-351ae4da012a"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
