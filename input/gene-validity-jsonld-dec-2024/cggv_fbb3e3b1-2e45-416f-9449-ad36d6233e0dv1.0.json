Many PMEs have similar clinical presentations yet are genetically heterogeneous, making accurate diagnosis difficult. A locus for PME was mapped in a consanguineous family with a single affected individual to chromosome 17q21. An identical-by-descent, homozygous mutation in GOSR2 (c.430G>T, p.Gly144Trp), a Golgi vesicle transport gene, was identified in this patient and in four apparently unrelated individuals. A comparison of the phenotypes in these patients defined a clinically distinct PME syndrome characterized by early-onset ataxia, action myoclonus by age 6, scoliosis, and mildly elevated serum creatine kinase. This p.Gly144Trp mutation is equivalent to a loss of function and results in failure of GOSR2 protein to localize to the cis-Golgi.","dc:creator":"Corbett MA","dc:date":"2011","dc:title":"A mutation in the Golgi Qb-SNARE gene GOSR2 causes progressive myoclonus epilepsy with early ataxia."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:fbb3e3b1-2e45-416f-9449-ad36d6233e0d_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:fbb3e3b1-2e45-416f-9449-ad36d6233e0d_ar_el","type":"EvidenceLine","specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallAutosomalRecessiveVariantEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":12},{"id":"cggv:147a0f30-9c37-4769-9a3c-1a966dbbbf7b_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:147a0f30-9c37-4769-9a3c-1a966dbbbf7b","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":7,"allele":{"id":"cggv:7087b238-8493-4d9b-aa45-110d6877a122","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_004287.5(GOSR2):c.430G>T (p.Gly144Trp)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA129191"}},"detectionMethod":"The authors used homozygosity mapping and linkage analysis to identify the region on chromosome 17 with the maximum possible LOD score.

Clinical presentation was remarkably similar with early onset ataxia (average 2 years of age), followed by myoclonic seizures at the average age of 6.5 years. Patients developed multiple seizure types, including generalized tonic clonic seizures, absence seizures and drop attacks. All patients developed scoliosis by adolescence, making this an important diagnostic clue. Additional skeletal deformities were present, including pes cavus in four patients and syndactyly in two patients. All patients had elevated serum creatine kinase levels (median 734 IU) in the context of normal muscle biopsies. Electroencephalography revealed pronounced generalized spike and wave discharges with a posterior predominance and photosensitivity in all patients, with focal EEG features seen in seven patients. The disease course showed a relentless decline; patients uniformly became wheelchair bound (mean age 13 years) and four had died during their third or early fourth decade. All 12 cases had the same variant (c.430G>T, G144W) and haplotype analyses confirmed a founder effect.

Here, using a multidisciplinary approach including genetics, immunofluorescence, western blotting, and live cell analysis, we implicate both TRAPPC11 and another membrane trafficking protein, GOSR2, in α-dystroglycan hypoglycosylation.","dc:creator":"Larson AA","dc:date":"2018","dc:title":"TRAPPC11 and GOSR2 mutations associate with hypoglycosylation of α-dystroglycan and muscular dystrophy."}},{"id":"cggv:b88ce3c7-61d5-494b-ae31-9af5317e3522_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:7087b238-8493-4d9b-aa45-110d6877a122"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29855340"}],"rdfs:label":"Larson Subject 3"},{"id":"cggv:51551086-947e-4722-8e3e-09834af785b1","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:51551086-947e-4722-8e3e-09834af785b1_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1},{"id":"cggv:b88ce3c7-61d5-494b-ae31-9af5317e3522","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b88ce3c7-61d5-494b-ae31-9af5317e3522_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:b88ce3c7-61d5-494b-ae31-9af5317e3522_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Protein failed to localize to the cis-golgi in patient primary skin fibroblast cell lines and yeast studies showed growth failure and lack of rescue by mutant protein [Corbett 2011PMID: 21549339].\n"}],"strengthScore":0.5}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:1472b3ec-c1c5-4215-83fb-83b582195653_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1472b3ec-c1c5-4215-83fb-83b582195653","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":14,"allele":[{"id":"cggv:4989d7f5-9a9f-4689-9e62-99341f9b19ed","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_004287.5(GOSR2):c.485_487AGA[2] (p.Lys164del)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA278920"}},{"id":"cggv:7087b238-8493-4d9b-aa45-110d6877a122"}],"detectionMethod":"All 12 scavenger receptor class B, member 2 (SCARB2) exons and GOSR2 c.430G>T were screened by Sanger sequencing.

In her twenties, she required a wheelchair to mobilize for longer distances and completely lost independent mobility in her thirties. Cognitive dysfunction was not a prominent feature, although mild cognitive decline was noted on repeated neuropsychometric testing. Brain imaging revealed generalized cerebral and cerebellar atrophy already in her thirties and was last repeated at age 59. Electrophysiology confirmed a cortical origin of the myoclonus. Scoliosis and areflexia were also noted; however, electromyography and nerve conduction studies were unremarkable. Currently, the patient lives in a residential care facility and is dependent for all the basic activities of daily living. Seizure control has been maintained through a combination of valproate, clonazepam, primidone, and levetiracetam with a reduction in myoclonus.","phenotypes":["obo:HP_0001250","obo:HP_0002066","obo:HP_0001272","obo:HP_0001336","obo:HP_0002505","obo:HP_0001284","obo:HP_0002059"],"previousTesting":true,"previousTestingDescription":"Negative for mutations in ATN1, mitochondrial A844G and A3243G","sex":"Female","variant":[{"id":"cggv:fd96f6f8-8a57-4144-be27-249d01065f37_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:4989d7f5-9a9f-4689-9e62-99341f9b19ed"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000877"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"No","zygosity":{"id":"cg:TwoVariantsInTrans"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30363482","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"The homozygous missense mutation c.430G>T (p.G144W) in the GOSR2 gene has been repeatedly shown to cause progressive myoclonus epilepsy/ataxia.

A founder variant (c.430G>T, p.Gly144Trp) has been reported in the homozygous state in at least 28 individuals with progressive myoclonus epilepsy (PMIDs: 21549339, 23449775, 24458321, 30838261, 32105965). In addition, seven other variants (splicing, nonsense, in-frame deletion, start loss, missense) have been reported in five additional probands across five publications, and are included in this curation (PMIDs: 30363482, 29855340, 33639315, 34167170, and 37895210). Most individuals reported in the literature, especially with the founder variant, have ataxia, myoclonus, seizures, scoliosis, and elevated creatine kinase. In addition to these features, some individuals who are not homozygous for the founder variant in *GOSR2* (either two non-founder variants or compound heterozygotes with a single founder variant) also present with muscular dystrophy and/or changes on muscle biopsy (PMIDs: 34167170, 29855340). There is no reported difference in disease mechanism for these cases. Because of this, and the large phenotypic overlap between these individuals and who are homozygous for the founder variant, we have lumped these cases into one curation for autosomal recessive progressive myoclonus epilepsy. The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be loss of function (PMIDs: 21549339, 28982678). In summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between *GOSR2* and autosomal recessive progressive myoclonus epilepsy. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time.\n\nThis classification was approved by the ClinGen Epilepsy Gene Curation Expert Panel on April 16, 2024 (SOP version 10).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:fbb3e3b1-2e45-416f-9449-ad36d6233e0d"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
