Bleeding scores and blood smear were evaluated. The variant pathogenicity from WES was determined by bioinformatics combined with all other information including platelet aggregometry, flow cytometry, and electron microscopy (EM).Seven unrelated Pts were recruited. All were female with macrothrombocytopenia. Clinical bleeding was presented in four Pts; extra-hematological features were minimal and family history was negative in every Pt. WES successfully identified all the 11 responsible mutant alleles; of these, four have never been previously reported. Pt 1 with GNE-related thrombocytopenia showed reduced lectin binding by flow cytometry, increased glycogen granules by EM and a novel homozygous mutation in GNE. Pts 2 and 3 had phenotypic diagnoses of Bernard Soulier syndrome and novel homozygous mutations in GP1BB and GP1BA, respectively. Pt 4 had impaired microtubule structures, concomitant delta storage pool disease by EM and a novel heterozygous TUBB1 mutation. Pt 5 had sitosterolemia showing platelets with reduced ristocetin responses and a dilated membrane system on EM with compound heterozygous ABCG5 mutations. Pts 6 and 7 had MYH9 disorders with heterozygous mutations in MYH9.This study substantiates the benefits of WES in identifying underlying mutations of macrothrombocytopenia, expands mutational spectra of four genes, and provides detailed clinical features for further phenotype-genotype correlations.","dc:creator":"Mekchay P","dc:date":"2020","dc:title":"Whole exome sequencing for diagnosis of hereditary thrombocytopenia."}},"rdfs:label":"Mekchay Pt 1"},{"id":"cggv:d2919fbc-2f72-4050-9e4c-d946536ef96c","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:d2919fbc-2f72-4050-9e4c-d946536ef96c_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1,"dc:description":"The homozygous missense variant, c.1417G>A, p.G473S (G547S), does not have functional evidence supporting its pathogenicity, however flow cytometric studies of sialic acid expression demonstrated ~70% decrease as compared to wild type which specific for a disorder affecting GNE, a key enzyme of sialic acid biosynthesis.

Evidence supporting this gene-disease curation includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data. Twelve unique variants (missense, nonsense, frameshift) have been reported in humans. Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 10 probands in 7 publications. Variants in this gene segregated with disease in 8 additional family members. The gene disease relationship is supported by biochemical function experiments (PMID: 30171045). Of note, this gene has also been implicated in both *GNE* myopathy and sialuria, which are considered distinct from this isolated macrothrombocytopena. In summary, there is moderate evidence to support this gene-disease relationship. Although more evidence is needed to support a causal role, no convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the gene-disease relationship.\n\nThis gene-disease pair was originally evaluated by the HT GCEP on 08/29/2020.
