In normal fibroblasts, factor H transcripts of 4.3 and 1.8 kilobase pairs (kb) encode a 155-kDa protein containing short consensus repeat (SCR) domains 1-20 and a 45-kDa protein which contains SCRs 1-7, respectively. The patient's fibroblasts expressed normal amounts of the 4.3- and 1.8-kb messages constitutively and after tumor necrosis factor-alpha/interferon-gamma stimulation. Lysates of [35S]methionine-labeled fibroblasts from the patient contained the 155- and 45-kDa H polypeptides, but secretion of the 155-kDa protein was blocked; the 45-kDa protein was secreted with normal kinetics. The patient's plasma lacked the 155-kDa protein but contained the small form of H. Moreover, in fibroblasts the retained 155-kDa factor H protein was not degraded, even after 12 h. Immunoflourescent staining and confocal microscopic imaging of the patient's fibroblasts indicated that factor H was retained in the endoplasmic reticulum. Sequence analysis of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction products (the entire coding region) and genomic DNA revealed a T1679C substitution on one allele and a G2949A substitution on the other (C518R mutation in SCR 9 and C991Y mutation in SCR 16, respectively). Both mutations affect conserved cysteine residues characteristic of SCR modules and therefore predict profound changes in the higher order structure of the 155-kDa factor H protein. These data provide the first description of a molecular mechanism for factor H deficiency and yield important insights into the normal secretory pathway for this and other plasma proteins with SCR motifs.","dc:creator":"Ault BH","dc:date":"1997","dc:title":"Human factor H deficiency.

Genetic analyses of two patients revealed deletion of a single Lys residue (K224) located within the complement regulatory region in domain 4 of Factor H. This deletion resulted in defective complement control: mutant protein purified from the plasma of patients showed severely reduced cofactor and decay-accelerating activity, as well as reduced binding to the central complement component C3b. However, cell-binding activity of the mutant protein was normal and comparable to wild-type Factor H. The patients are daughters of consanguineous parents. As both patients but also their healthy mother were positive for C3 nephritic factor, the mutant Factor H protein is considered relevant for unrestricted activation of the disease-causing activation of the alternative complement pathway. Replacement of functional Factor H by fresh frozen plasma (10-15 ml/kg/14 days) was well tolerated, prevented so far disease progression in both patients, and is in the long run expected to preserve kidney function.","dc:creator":"Licht C","dc:date":"2006","dc:title":"Deletion of Lys224 in regulatory domain 4 of Factor H reveals a novel pathomechanism for dense deposit disease (MPGN II)."}},"rdfs:label":"Patient A"},{"id":"cggv:f4c79b3e-3e53-41fc-8b31-0f83d31ddb13","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f4c79b3e-3e53-41fc-8b31-0f83d31ddb13_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:f4c79b3e-3e53-41fc-8b31-0f83d31ddb13_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"Binding of FH to immobilized C3b was tested by plasmon resonance.

Among six patients with homozygous deficiency, four presented with membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, and two with atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). The ten other patients had heterozygous FH deficiency and developed atypical HUS. HUS onset occurred from birth to midadulthood, and disease progression was variable. Four children with homozygous or heterozygous FH deficiency and HUS underwent renal transplantation, which was successful in three but failed as a result of recurrence of HUS in one patient. All but one patient exhibited alternative pathway-mediated complement consumption, with no detectable FH antigenic levels or with 50% immunochemical or functional FH levels in the case of complete or partial deficiency, respectively. The molecular mechanisms of the deficiency were documented in all cases by exon-specific sequencing analysis. These mechanisms included nucleotide substitutions, insertion, or deletion located in SCR 2, 7, 11, 13, 15, and 20, leading to an amino acid substitution or to a stop codon.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the cause of complement activation in this disease. Transfusion of normal porcine plasma to affected piglets inhibited complement activation and increased survival. Plasma was successively fractionated and the complement inhibitory effect of each fraction tested in vivo. A single chain 150-kD protein which showed the same complement inhibitory effect as whole plasma was finally isolated. Immunologic cross-reactivity, functional properties, and NH2-terminal sequence identified the protein as factor H. By Western blotting and enzyme immunoassay, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis-affected piglets were demonstrated to be subtotally deficient in factor H. At 1 wk of age, median (range) factor H concentration was 1.6 mg/liter (1.1-2.3) in deficient animals (n = 13) and 51 mg/liter (26-98) in healthy littermates (n = 52). Our data show that hereditary porcine membrano-proliferative glomerulonephritis type II is caused by factor H deficiency.","dc:creator":"Høgåsen K","dc:date":"1995","dc:title":"Hereditary porcine membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis type II is caused by factor H deficiency."},"rdfs:label":"Pig model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2},{"id":"cggv:f7535783-17c8-4c3b-b526-477b174c1624","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":2,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:08771903-bb1e-498c-b763-642a644273e8","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:ProteinAlterationDisruptsOrganismFunction"},"dc:description":"CFH −/− mice develop membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) spontaneously and are hypersensitive to developing renal injury caused by immune complexes. Amounts of plasma C3 were reduced markedly in CFH−/− mice, and most plasma C3 in CFH−/− mice was in the form of C3b as determined by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, which allows the separation of C3 and C3b on the basis of charge difference. The CFH+/− mice had significantly lower amounts of plasma C3 than did WT mice, which suggested that heterozygous deficiency was sufficient to impair physiological control of spontaneous C3 activation. 8 months: significant mortality had occurred in the CFH−/− mice (23%, P < 0.0001) whereas no deaths had occurred in the CFH+/− or WT mice. 3 of the CFH−/− mice that died showed hematuria and proteinuria before death. Renal histology of four of the animals that died spontaneously showed marked mesangial matrix expansion, mesangial hypercellularity, peripheral capillary loop thickening with deposition of periodic acid–Schiff (PAS)-positive material and a double-contour appearance of the glomerular basement membrane.","dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12091909","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"The alternative pathway of complement is activated continuously in vivo through the C3 'tick-over' pathway. This pathway is triggered by the hydrolysis of C3, resulting in the formation of C3 convertase. This, in turn, generates C3b, which mediates many of the biological functions of complement. Factor H, the main regulator of this activation, prevents formation and promotes dissociation of the C3 convertase enzyme, and, together with factor I, mediates the proteolytic inactivation of C3b. Factor H deficiency, described in 29 individuals from 12 families and in pigs, allows unhindered activation of fluid-phase C3 and severe depletion of plasma C3 (ref. 11). Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) occurs in factor H-deficient humans and pigs. Although MPGN has been reported in other conditions in which uncontrolled activation of C3 occurs, the role of C3 dysregulation in the pathogenesis of MPGN is not understood. Here we show that mice deficient in factor H (Cfh(-/-) mice) develop MPGN spontaneously and are hypersensitive to developing renal injury caused by immune complexes. Introducing a second mutation in the gene encoding complement factor B, which prevents C3 turnover in vivo, obviates the phenotype of Cfh(-/-) mice. Thus, uncontrolled C3 activation in vivo is essential for the development of MPGN associated with deficiency of factor H.","dc:creator":"Pickering MC","dc:date":"2002","dc:title":"Uncontrolled C3 activation causes membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis in mice deficient in complement factor H."},"rdfs:label":"Mouse model"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityNonHumanModelOrganismCriteria","strengthScore":2}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallModelAndRescueEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityOverallExperimentalEvidenceCriteria","strengthScore":4.5}],"evidenceStrength":"Definitive","sequence":8745,"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityCriteria10","strengthScore":15,"subject":{"id":"cggv:18f08d98-1173-4cc5-8baf-dfc803868b80","type":"GeneValidityProposition","disease":"obo:MONDO_0013892","gene":"hgnc:4883","modeOfInheritance":"obo:HP_0000007"},"version":"1.1","dc:description":"CFH was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive C3 glomerulopathy (C3G) in 1997 (Ault et al., PMID: 9312129). C3G is characterized by complement dysregulation occurring in the fluid phase and in the glomerular microenvironment (Smith et al., 2019, PMID: 30692664). The term C3G is inclusive of dense deposit disease (DDD) and C3 glomerulonephritis (C3GN). Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, we found differences in inheritance patterns. Therefore, autosomal recessive cases and autosomal dominant cases were reviewed separately. Following review of autosomal dominant C3G, it was determined by expert consensus that heterozygous variation in CFH is a risk factor of C3G, but not associated with Mendelian disease. Eight variants (missense and in-frame indel) that have been reported in 7 probands in 4 publications (PMIDs: 9312129, 14978182, 16612335, 37615951) are included in this curation. Of note, the score of missense variants at cysteine residues have been upgraded to reflect the equivalent score of truncating variants based on their structural impact to factor H, per expert consensus (Ault et al., 1997, PMID: 9312129). The mechanism of pathogenicity is known to be LOF. This gene-disease association is also supported by a mouse and pig model as well as biochemical function (PMIDs: 7883953, 12091909, 16612335). In summary, CFH is definitively associated with autosomal recessive C3G. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen Complement-Mediated Kidney Diseases GCEP on the meeting date February 21, 2024 (SOP Version 10.1).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:9eeff991-b5ac-4d1b-a128-47fa2306c1c5"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
