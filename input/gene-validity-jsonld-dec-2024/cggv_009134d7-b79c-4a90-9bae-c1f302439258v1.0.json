Mice with a disrupted mdr2 gene completely lack biliary phospholipid excretion and develop progressive liver disease, characterized histologically by portal inflammation, proliferation of the bile duct epithelium, and fibrosis. This disease phenotype is very similar to a subtype of progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis, hallmarked by a high serum gamma-glutamyltransferase (gamma-GT) activity. We report immunohistochemistry for MDR3 P-gp, reverse transcription-coupled PCR sequence analysis, and genomic DNA analysis of MDR3 from two progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis patients with high serum gamma-GT. Canalicular staining for MDR3 P-gp was negative in liver tissue of both patients. Reverse transcription-coupled PCR sequencing of the first patient's sequence demonstrated a homozygous 7-bp deletion, starting at codon 132, which results in a frameshift and introduces a stop codon 29 codons downstream. The second patient is homozygous for a nonsense mutation in codon 957 (C --> T) that introduces a stop codon (TGA). Our results demonstrate that mutations in the human MDR3 gene lead to progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis with high serum gamma-GT. The histopathological picture in these patients is very similar to that in the corresponding mdr2(-/-) mouse, in which mdr2 P-gp deficiency induces complete absence of phospholipid in bile.","dc:creator":"de Vree JM","dc:date":"1998","dc:title":"Mutations in the MDR3 gene cause progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:009134d7-b79c-4a90-9bae-c1f302439258_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7d3757cc-31b3-493d-8994-8efaa66fa5ad_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7d3757cc-31b3-493d-8994-8efaa66fa5ad","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Months","ageValue":8,"allele":{"id":"cggv:9e0031b2-423b-46a0-a936-a81509701ab0","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_000443.4(ABCB4):c.2869C>T (p.Arg957Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA123355"}},"detectionMethod":"After immunohistochemistry identified the *ABCB4* locus as a candidate, Sanger sequencing of cDNA from the *ABCB4* locus was used for genotyping.","firstTestingMethod":"Sanger sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"The patient has been diagnosed with PFIC with elevated gamma-GT activity.

In this study, we examined the effects of 12 missense variations identified in progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 3 patients. We classified these variations on the basis of the defects thus identified and explored potential rescue of trafficking-defective mutants by pharmacological means. Variations were reproduced in the ABCB4 complementary DNA and the mutants, thus obtained, expressed in HepG2 and HEK293 cells. Three mutants were either fully (I541F and L556R) or largely (Q855L) retained in the endoplasmic reticulum, in an immature form. Rescue of the defect, i.e., increase in the mature form at the bile canaliculi, was obtained by cell treatments with cyclosporin A or C and, to a lesser extent, B, D, or H. Five mutations with little or no effect on ABCB4 expression at the bile canaliculi caused a decrease (F357L, T775M, and G954S) or almost absence (S346I and P726L) of phosphatidylcholine secretion. Two mutants (T424A and N510S) were normally processed and expressed at the bile canaliculi, but their stability was reduced. We found no defect of the T175A mutant or of R652G, previously described as a polymorphism. In patients, the most severe phenotypes appreciated by the duration of transplant-free survival were caused by ABCB4 variants that were markedly retained in the endoplasmic reticulum and expressed in a homozygous status.","dc:creator":"Delaunay JL","dc:date":"2016","dc:title":"A functional classification of ABCB4 variations causing progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 3."}},"rdfs:label":"Delaunay_2015_Patient_2"},{"id":"cggv:ea3065b7-e850-4cc4-b56c-b786fe4213c6","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ea3065b7-e850-4cc4-b56c-b786fe4213c6_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:ea3065b7-e850-4cc4-b56c-b786fe4213c6_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"Yes","dc:description":"NM_000443.4:c.1667T>G (p.Leu556Arg) is a missense variant in exon 14 of 28 that has been shown to disrupt folding, maturation, and eventually movement out of the endoplasmic reticulum.

The 129/OlaHsd mice with a homozygous disruption of the mdr2 gene (-/- mice) lack this P-glycoprotein in the canalicular membrane. These mice are unable to secrete phospholipids into bile, showing an essential role for the mdr2 P-glycoprotein in the transport of phosphatidylcholine across the canalicular membrane. The complete absence of phospholipids from bile leads to a hepatic disease, which becomes manifest shortly after birth and shows progression to an end stage in the course of 3 months. The liver pathology is that of a nonsuppurative inflammatory cholangitis with portal inflammation and ductular proliferation, consistent with toxic injury of the biliary system from bile salts unaccompanied by phospholipids. Thus, the mdr2 (-/-) mice can serve as an animal model for studying mechanisms and potential interventions in nonsuppurative inflammatory cholangitis (in a generic sense) in human disease, be it congenital or acquired. When the mice are 4 to 6 months of age, preneoplastic lesions develop in the liver, progressing to metastatic liver cancer in the terminal phase. The mdr2 (-/-) mice therefore also provide a tumor progression model of value for the study of hepatic carcinogenesis. Interestingly, also in this regard, the model mimicks human disease, because chronic inflammation of the biliary system in humans may similarly carry increased cancer risk.","dc:creator":"Mauad TH","dc:date":"1994","dc:title":"Mice with homozygous disruption of the mdr2 P-glycoprotein gene.

Affected individuals harboring homozygous or compound heterozygous variants are typically diagnosed with progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 3, and generally present between infancy and late adolescence with jaundice, pruritus, bile duct proliferation, cholestasis, hepatosplenomegaly, elevated serum gamma-glutamyltransferase, and/or increased serum bile acids. The disease progresses in many cases to develop portal hypertension, fibrosis, cirrhosis, and eventually liver failure and transplantation, although some cases respond positively to ursodeoxycholate treatment (PMID: 17726488). Neoplasm of the liver can develop in some cases as well. Heterozygous *ABCB4* variants have also been reported in association with cholestasis, typically with a diagnosis of either intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy 3 or gallbladder disease 1. Although these presentations can occur in carriers in families with recessive progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis, their adult onset, low penetrance and monoallelic state constitute a different disease. Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping & Splitting Working Group, the molecular mechanism of loss of function has been found to be consistent between cases harboring biallelic and monoallelic variants in *ABCB4*. However, the dramatic difference in phenotypic severity between the biallelic and monoallelic cases distinguishes them as two different conditions rather than a single broad spectrum disease. Therefore, cases caused by biallelic *ABCB4* variants have been separately curated here for progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 3 (MONDO:0011214, MIM #614972).\n\nTwelve suspected pathogenic variants have been scored as part of this curation (six missense, two nonsense, three frameshift, and one disrupting a canonical splice site). These have been collectively reported in ten probands in four publications (PMID: 9419367, PMID: 26474921, PMID: 32793533, PMID: 11313315). The mechanism of pathogenicity appears to be biallelic loss of *ABCB4* function conferred by null and/or hypomorphic variants. Eight out of ten probands were homozygous for their respective variants, while two probands were compound heterozygous. Segregation evidence has not contributed to the scoring of the gene-disease relationship. Additional case-level evidence is available in the literature but was not included in this curation as the maximum score for this category of evidence had already been reached.\n\nThis gene-disease association is also supported by experimental evidence that the expression pattern of *ABCB4* across human tissues is highly restricted to the liver (PMID: 23715323). Biochemical studies indicate that *ABCB4* encodes a transporter of the ATP-binding cassette family that localizes to the canalicular membrane of hepatocytes, consistent with a role in transporting phospholipid into bile secretions that form at this site (PMID: 7734012). Reduced expression of *ABCB4* has been detected in a subset of progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis cases characterized by elevated serum levels of gamma-glutamyltransferase activity (PMID: 8666348). Homozygous disruption of the mouse ortholog of *ABCB4* recapitulates human patient features such as the absence of phospholipids from bile, hyperbilirubinemia, nonsuppurative inflammatory cholangitis, bile duct proliferation, portal inflammation, neoplasm of the liver, hepatocyte degeneration, portal fibrosis, and widening and tortuosity of the bile canaliculi (PMID: 7977654). Some of these phenotypes can be rescued by injection of lipid nanoparticles delivering wild-type *ABCB4* mRNA (PMID: 33340584).\n\nIn summary, *ABCB4* is definitively associated with progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 3, an autosomal recessive condition. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both research and diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time without the emergence of contradictory evidence, leading to a Definitive classification. This classification was approved by the ClinGen General Gene Curation Expert Panel on November 23rd, 2022 (SOP Version 9).","dc:isVersionOf":{"id":"cggv:009134d7-b79c-4a90-9bae-c1f302439258"},"@context":{"@vocab":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","id":"@id","type":"@type","cg":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/terms/","dc":"http://purl.org/dc/terms/","obo":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/","hgnc":"https://identifiers.org/hgnc:","rdfs":"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#","cggv":"http://dataexchange.clinicalgenome.org/gci/","evidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"calculatedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"computedEvidenceStrength":{"@type":"@vocab"},"specifiedBy":{"@type":"@vocab"},"evidence":{"@container":"@set"},"disease":{"@type":"@vocab"},"gene":{"@type":"@vocab"},"phenotypes":{"@type":"@id"},"agent":{"@type":"@id"},"role":{"@type":"@vocab"},"modeOfInheritance":{"@type":"@vocab"},"sex":{"@type":"@vocab"},"direction":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageType":{"@type":"@vocab"},"ageUnit":{"@type":"@vocab"},"dc:source":{"@type":"@id"}}}
