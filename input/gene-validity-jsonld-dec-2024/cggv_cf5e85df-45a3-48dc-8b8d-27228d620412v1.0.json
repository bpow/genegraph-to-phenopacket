Using positional cloning, we identified mutations in the phospholipase C epsilon gene (PLCE1) as causing early-onset nephrotic syndrome with end-stage kidney disease. Kidney histology of affected individuals showed diffuse mesangial sclerosis (DMS). Using immunofluorescence, we found PLCepsilon1 expression in developing and mature glomerular podocytes and showed that DMS represents an arrest of normal glomerular development. We identified IQ motif-containing GTPase-activating protein 1 as a new interaction partner of PLCepsilon1. Two siblings with a missense mutation in an exon encoding the PLCepsilon1 catalytic domain showed histology characteristic of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. Notably, two other affected individuals responded to therapy, making this the first report of a molecular cause of nephrotic syndrome that may resolve after therapy. These findings, together with the zebrafish model of human nephrotic syndrome generated by plce1 knockdown, open new inroads into pathophysiology and treatment mechanisms of nephrotic syndrome.","dc:creator":"Hinkes B","dc:date":"2006","dc:title":"Positional cloning uncovers mutations in PLCE1 responsible for a nephrotic syndrome variant that may be reversible."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:cf5e85df-45a3-48dc-8b8d-27228d620412_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1c0a0d9e-4009-430b-bc8a-5b5d9f36915c_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:1c0a0d9e-4009-430b-bc8a-5b5d9f36915c","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:4faa5fa0-47f1-44f7-8752-47d403615e38","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_016341.4(PLCE1):c.6004-1G>A","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA377645215"}},"sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:300be8df-83b1-49ae-a069-5a59c608ea48_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:4faa5fa0-47f1-44f7-8752-47d403615e38"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":{"id":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25349199","type":"dc:BibliographicResource","dc:abstract":"Steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS) is the second most frequent cause of ESRD in the first two decades of life. Effective treatment is lacking. First insights into disease mechanisms came from identification of single-gene causes of SRNS. However, the frequency of single-gene causation and its age distribution in large cohorts are unknown. We performed exon sequencing of NPHS2 and WT1 for 1783 unrelated, international families with SRNS. We then examined all patients by microfluidic multiplex PCR and next-generation sequencing for all 27 genes known to cause SRNS if mutated. We detected a single-gene cause in 29.5% (526 of 1783) of families with SRNS that manifested before 25 years of age. The fraction of families in whom a single-gene cause was identified inversely correlated with age of onset. Within clinically relevant age groups, the fraction of families with detection of the single-gene cause was as follows: onset in the first 3 months of life (69.4%), between 4 and 12 months old (49.7%), between 1 and 6 years old (25.3%), between 7 and 12 years old (17.8%), and between 13 and 18 years old (10.8%). For PLCE1, specific mutations correlated with age of onset. Notably, 1% of individuals carried mutations in genes that function within the coenzyme Q10 biosynthesis pathway, suggesting that SRNS may be treatable in these individuals. Our study results should facilitate molecular genetic diagnostics of SRNS, etiologic classification for therapeutic studies, generation of genotype-phenotype correlations, and the identification of individuals in whom a targeted treatment for SRNS may be available.

aim of the study was to present our experience in treating children with genetic forms of nephrotic syndrome and diagnosing these diseases. We retrospectively reviewed the clinical data, mutational analyses, histopathological features, treatment modalities, and outcome of 26 consecutive children (20 families) suffering from congenital and/or steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome who were assessed by genetic analysis. Ten out of 26 children (38%) had congenital nephrotic syndrome, 4/26 (15%) had infantile nephrotic syndrome, 10/26 (38%) had late-onset nephrotic syndrome, and 2/26 (9%) had asymptomatic proteinuria. We detected a mutation in 21/26 (81%) patients and in 15/20 (75%) families. NPHS1 mutation analyses were positive in 4/20 (20%), NPHS2 mutations in 4/20 (20%), WT1 mutations in 4/20 (20%), and PLCE1 mutations in 3/20 (15%) families. NPHS1 and PLCE1 mutations were solely found in patients with the earliest onset. The majority of patients, especially those with early onset of nephrotic syndrome, had serious adverse events related to the nephrotic status, and 19/26 (73%) reached end-stage renal failure at a median age of 27 months. Genetic forms of nephrotic syndrome comprise a heterogeneous group of genetic mutations. The progression toward end-stage renal failure is the rule but is highly variable between patients.","dc:creator":"Ismaili K","dc:date":"2009","dc:title":"Genetic forms of nephrotic syndrome: a single-center experience in Brussels."}},"rdfs:label":"II-1"},{"id":"cggv:c6da4492-4f0b-41b8-8012-3fa6fb0b8a53","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:c6da4492-4f0b-41b8-8012-3fa6fb0b8a53_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"It is downgraded due to homozygosity and consanguinity"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:599ba627-87f9-405a-a000-e4ce05e6f108_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:599ba627-87f9-405a-a000-e4ce05e6f108","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:612186aa-c744-4170-93d7-0c1a77d8a084","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_016341.4(PLCE1):c.5276C>T (p.Ser1759Leu)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA5613326"}},"sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:f57bb7a3-c2ad-47a7-ae43-1027b9c71b35_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:612186aa-c744-4170-93d7-0c1a77d8a084"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35034193"},"rdfs:label":"II-1"},{"id":"cggv:f57bb7a3-c2ad-47a7-ae43-1027b9c71b35","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":0.1,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:f57bb7a3-c2ad-47a7-ae43-1027b9c71b35_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":0.1,"dc:description":"Total score could be downgraded to 0.1 due to homozygosity and consanguinityIsolated proteinuria at 4 mo, Bx was FSGS "}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:8ebd8c60-623c-4698-9a18-9f9c6293cc73_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8ebd8c60-623c-4698-9a18-9f9c6293cc73","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:7fd4f1c5-a6df-4666-9440-7e3a3badaafa","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_016341.4(PLCE1):c.3846del (p.Leu1283CysfsTer26)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA10575470"}},"sex":"UnknownEthnicity","variant":{"id":"cggv:bab1bfe2-9dde-49f3-b162-212aa1e98de9_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:7fd4f1c5-a6df-4666-9440-7e3a3badaafa"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"paternityMaternityConfirmed":"Yes","zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17086182"},"rdfs:label":"II-1, II-3 "},{"id":"cggv:bab1bfe2-9dde-49f3-b162-212aa1e98de9","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:bab1bfe2-9dde-49f3-b162-212aa1e98de9_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1,"dc:description":"It is downgraded due to homozygous consangiunity"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:ab8e2947-c012-444e-988b-f9632062b44c_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:ab8e2947-c012-444e-988b-f9632062b44c","type":"Proband","allele":{"id":"cggv:14aef208-d0d5-4dc3-94f7-6ca03030ee3b","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_016341.4(PLCE1):c.4192dup (p.Leu1398ProfsTer?)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA5613075"}},"detectionMethod":"They used a two-step approach for mutation analysis in PLCE1.

Catalytic activity of PLCs results in the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate to generate inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG) which opens DAG-sensitive classical transient receptor channels 3, 6, and 7 (TRPC3/6/7), initiating Ca(2+) influx from the extracellular space. Patients with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) express gain-of-function mutants of TRPC6, while others carry loss-of-function mutants of PLCε, raising the intriguing possibility that both proteins interact and might work in the same signalling pathway. While TRPC6 activation by PLCβ and PLCγ isozymes was extensively studied, the role of PLCε in TRPC6 activation remains elusive. TRPC6 was co-immunoprecipitated with PLCε in a heterologous overexpression system in HEK293 cells as well as in freshly isolated murine podocytes. Receptor-operated TRPC6 currents in HEK293 cells expressing TRPC6 were reduced by a specific PLCε siRNA and by a PLCε loss-of-function mutant isolated from a patient with FSGS. PLCε-induced TRPC6 activation was also identified in murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) lacking Gαq/11 proteins. Further analysis of the signal transduction pathway revealed a Gα12/13 Rho-GEF activation which induced Rho-mediated PLCε stimulation. Therefore, we identified a new pathway for TRPC6 activation by PLCε. PLCε-/- podocytes however, were undistinguishable from WT podocytes in their angiotensin II-induced formation of actin stress fibers and their GTPγS-induced TRPC6 activation, pointing to a redundant role of PLCε-mediated TRPC6 activation at least in podocytes.","dc:creator":"Kalwa H","dc:date":"2015","dc:title":"Phospholipase C epsilon (PLCε) induced TRPC6 activation: a common but redundant mechanism in primary podocytes."},"rdfs:label":"Kalwa et al."}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityProteinInteractionCriteria","strengthScore":0.5},{"id":"cggv:8905f783-ad45-4d0b-a708-9cfbaa1d5b1e","type":"EvidenceLine","calculatedScore":0.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:8f9ebb80-0752-46e9-9c8d-126d544cb09e","type":"Finding","demonstrates":{"id":"cg:BiochemicalFunctionB"},"dc:description":"PLCE1 interacts with RAC1 and RhoA that regulate actin cytoskeleton remodelling.

To address this, we investigated the function of PLCE1 in podocytes called glomerular epithelial cells, where the pathogenesis of nephrotic syndrome converges. PLCE1 colocalized with Rho GTPases in glomeruli. Further, it interacted with Rho GTPases through the pleckstrin homology domain and Ras GTP-binding domains 1/2. Knockdown or knockout of PLCE1 in podocytes resulted in decreased levels of GTP-bound Rac1 and Cdc42, but not those of RhoA, and caused a reduction in cell migration. PLCE1 interacted with NCK2 but not with NCK1. Similar to the PLCE1 knockout, NCK2 knockout resulted in decreased podocyte migration. Knockout of PLCE1 reduced the EGF-induced activation of ERK and cell proliferation in podocytes, whereas knockout of NCK2 did not affect proliferation. Further, the knockout of PLCE1 also resulted in decreased expression of podocyte markers, including NEPH1, NPHS1, WT1, and SYNPO, upon differentiation, but the knockout of NCK2 did not affect the expression of these markers. Therefore, our findings demonstrate that PLCE1 regulates Rho GTPase activity and cell migration through interacting with NCK2 and that PLCE1 also plays a role in the proliferation and differentiation of podocytes, regardless of the presence of NCK2.","dc:creator":"Yu S","dc:date":"2020","dc:title":"PLCE1 regulates the migration, proliferation, and differentiation of podocytes."},"rdfs:label":"Yu et al.

The preferred disease name suggested for this disorder is ‘Nephrotic syndrome - *PLCE1*’. The mechanism of pathogenicity is known to be loss of function. Nephrotic syndrome - *PLCE1* is characterized by significant protein loss in the urine within the first months of life causing generalized edema.\n\nAt least 46 variants (frameshift, nonsense, splice, missense) have been reported in 56 probands in 6 publications (PMIDs: 10997929, 35034193, 29127259, 25349199, 18709391, 18065803 included in this curation).

PLCE1 knockout human podocytes showed reduced markers of podocytes including NPHS1, NEPH1, WT1, and SYPO (PMID: 32238860) in addition to reduced podocyte proliferation. Also, podocytes transfected with PLCE1 siRNA exhibited a significant decrease in Rac1 and Cdc42 levels that regulate podocyte actin cytoskeleton stabilization (PMID: 32238860). In particular, PLCE1 knockdown zebrafish showed signs of podocytopathy (PMID: 10997929). Interestingly, PLCE1 knockout mice exhibited normal kidney structure and function (PMIDs: 32223311, 10997929), however, a second hit such as hypertension (Angiotensin II treatment) or nephron loss (unilateral nephrectomy) caused the development of FSGS lesions (PMID: 32223311). A total of 5.5/6 pts. for experimental evidence was reached.\n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence supporting the relationship between *PLCE1* and autosomal recessive nephrotic syndrome.
