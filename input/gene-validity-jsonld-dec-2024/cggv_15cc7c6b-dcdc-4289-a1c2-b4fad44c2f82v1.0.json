However, in many of these disorders, the underlying genetic defect has yet to be discovered. Here, we identify homozygous nonsense and missense mutations in the orphan gene C20orf72 in three families with a mitochondrial syndrome characterized by external ophthalmoplegia, emaciation and respiratory failure. Muscle biopsies showed mtDNA depletion and multiple mtDNA deletions. C20orf72, hereafter MGME1 (mitochondrial genome maintenance exonuclease 1), encodes a mitochondrial RecB-type exonuclease belonging to the PD-(D/E)XK nuclease superfamily. We show that MGME1 cleaves single-stranded DNA and processes DNA flap substrates. Fibroblasts from affected individuals do not repopulate after chemically induced mtDNA depletion. They also accumulate intermediates of stalled replication and show increased levels of 7S DNA, as do MGME1-depleted cells. Thus, we show that MGME1-mediated mtDNA processing is essential for mitochondrial genome maintenance.","dc:creator":"Kornblum C","dc:date":"2013","dc:title":"Loss-of-function mutations in MGME1 impair mtDNA replication and cause multisystemic mitochondrial disease."},"evidence":[{"id":"cggv:15cc7c6b-dcdc-4289-a1c2-b4fad44c2f82_overall_genetic_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:06155033-9297-47e8-9c2f-2c8995b6bb65_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:06155033-9297-47e8-9c2f-2c8995b6bb65","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":31,"allele":{"id":"cggv:0bab3d99-f791-4b6a-ba9e-35b76ea234a2","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_052865.4(MGME1):c.456G>A (p.Trp152Ter)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA214404"}},"ethnicity":{"id":"cg:UnknownEthnicity"},"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"PEO with proximal weakness and generalized muscle wasting, profound emaciation, respiratory failure (noninvasive ventilation), mild spinal deformities.\n\nMuscle biopsy: few RRF, scattered COX-negative fibers (1.4–1.7%) \nLR PCR detected multiple mitochondrial DNA deletions. \n","previousTesting":false,"sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:0e7806b6-cfc0-4ad9-886d-6d3a3316f012_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:0bab3d99-f791-4b6a-ba9e-35b76ea234a2"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23313956"},"rdfs:label":"Kornblum 2013 Family II (I)"},{"id":"cggv:0e7806b6-cfc0-4ad9-886d-6d3a3316f012","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:0e7806b6-cfc0-4ad9-886d-6d3a3316f012_variant_evidence_item"},{"id":"cggv:0e7806b6-cfc0-4ad9-886d-6d3a3316f012_function_evidence_item","type":"VariantFunctionalImpactEvidence","functionalDataSupport":"No","dc:description":"Stop gain exon 2/5 NMD expected. \n"}],"strengthScore":0.5,"dc:description":"subsequent occurrence of a founder, 0.5pt score only based on GCEP agreed rubric"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:b354dd17-1781-4e23-9513-3120eced0044_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:b354dd17-1781-4e23-9513-3120eced0044","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":10,"allele":{"id":"cggv:0bab3d99-f791-4b6a-ba9e-35b76ea234a2"},"ethnicity":{"id":"cg:UnknownEthnicity"},"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"Progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO) with proximal weakness and generalized muscle wasting, profound emaciation, respiratory failure (non- invasive ventilation). mental retardation,\nGastrointestinal symptoms, renal colics, spinal deformities.  \nBrain MRI: cerebellar atrophy (age 10 and 26 yrs)\nSkeletal muscle biopsy: few RRF, few scattered COX negative fibers (0.4%), \nLR PCR detected multiple mitochondrial DNA deletions. \nCombined complex I/IV-deficiency\nFH -similarly affected brother and sister, brother died at age 26 due to cardiac failure. \n\n","previousTesting":false,"sex":"Male","variant":{"id":"cggv:7591b2be-5827-490c-bda6-a8d0ca1023d3_variant_evidence_item","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004116","allele":{"id":"cggv:0bab3d99-f791-4b6a-ba9e-35b76ea234a2"},"alleleOrigin":{"id":"obo:GENO_0000888"},"zygosity":{"id":"cg:Homozygous"},"dc:source":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23313956"},"rdfs:label":"Kornblum 2013 Family I (I)"},{"id":"cggv:7591b2be-5827-490c-bda6-a8d0ca1023d3","type":"obo:SEPIO_0004097","calculatedScore":1.5,"direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:7591b2be-5827-490c-bda6-a8d0ca1023d3_variant_evidence_item"}],"strengthScore":1.5,"dc:description":"Stop gain exon 2/5 NMD expected, suspected founder variant\n"}],"specifiedBy":"GeneValidityMaximumProbandScoreCriteria"},{"id":"cggv:93863ff9-4ca9-42fd-8ea8-f3e7954faa21_proband_score_evidence_line","type":"EvidenceLine","direction":"Supports","evidence":[{"id":"cggv:93863ff9-4ca9-42fd-8ea8-f3e7954faa21","type":"Proband","ageType":"AgeAtOnset","ageUnit":"Years","ageValue":3,"allele":{"id":"cggv:8950c04f-b5f9-4665-b6be-f3c041c03ca3","type":"https://terms.ga4gh.org/VariationDescriptor","http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#prefLabel":"NM_052865.4(MGME1):c.359del (p.Pro120LeufsTer2)","https://terms.ga4gh.org/CanonicalReference":{"id":"http://reg.genome.network/allele/CA658684235"}},"ethnicity":{"id":"cg:UnknownEthnicity"},"firstTestingMethod":"Exome sequencing","phenotypeFreeText":"Early onset cerebellar ataxia, speech delay, microcephaly, cerebellar atrophy and fundus albipunctatus, strabismus, \n\nBrain imaging showed cerebellar atrophy (Fig. 1B).

To better understand the in vivo function of MGME1 and the associated disease pathophysiology, we characterized a Mgme1 mouse knockout model by extensive phenotyping of ageing knockout animals. We show that loss of MGME1 leads to de novo formation of linear deleted mtDNA fragments that are constantly made and degraded. These findings contradict previous proposal that MGME1 is essential for degradation of linear mtDNA fragments and instead support a model where MGME1 has a critical role in completion of mtDNA replication. We report that Mgme1 knockout mice develop a dramatic phenotype as they age and display progressive weight loss, cataract and retinopathy. Surprisingly, aged animals also develop kidney inflammation, glomerular changes and severe chronic progressive nephropathy, consistent with nephrotic syndrome.

The *MGME1* gene encodes metal-dependent single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) exonuclease which is involved in mitochondrial genome DNA replication termination and is essential for maintenance and stability of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). \n\nThe *MGME1* gene was first reported in relation to autosomal recessive primary mitochondrial disease in 2013 (PMID: 23313956), in three individuals with ophthalmoplegia, myopathy, and respiratory failure. While various names could be given to the constellation of features seen in those with *MGME1*-related disease, pathogenic variants in this gene cause a primary mitochondrial disease. Therefore, the *MGME1* phenotype has been lumped into one disease entity according to the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Framework.\n\nEvidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. This curation included four unique variants reported in five probands from three publications (PMIDs: 23313956, 28711739, 37429773). Variants included one frameshift, two nonsense, and one missense.  The c.456G>A (p.Trp152Ter) variant was identified in two families from Lebanon and Italy that shared a common haplotype and is a proposed founder variant (PMID: 23313956). In the few affected individuals reported to date, the disorder is characterized by progressive external ophthalmoplegia and neuromuscular symptoms including muscle wasting, proximal weakness, exercise intolerance, and respiratory distress. Other features may include profound emaciation, spinal deformities, gastrointestinal issues and cardiac phenotypes such as arrythmias and dilated cardiomyopathy. Brain MRI findings include cerebellar atrophy. As well as phenotypic heterogeneity, a range in age of onset is observed, ranging from infant onset to the fourth decade.  At least three additional cases are reported in the medical literature (PMIDs: 25058219, 28097321, 32528171) but were not included in this curation given limited clinical details provided.\n\nThis gene-disease relationship is also supported by a biochemical function shared with other genes associated with primary mitochondrial disease. Abnormal replication of the mitochondrial genome has been demonstrated in patient fibroblasts and a *Mgme1* knockout mouse model which also recapitulates aspects of primary mitochondrial disease (PMIDs: 23313956, 29572490, 35533204). \n\nIn summary, there is definitive evidence to support the relationship between *MGME1* and primary mitochondrial disease. This relationship has been demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the NICHD/NINDS U24 ClinGen Mitochondrial Disease Gene Curation Expert Panel on August 7, 2023 (SOP Version 9).
